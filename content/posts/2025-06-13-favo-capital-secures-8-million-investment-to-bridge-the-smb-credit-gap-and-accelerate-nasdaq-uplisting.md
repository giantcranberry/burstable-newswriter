This funding is earmarked for fueling the company's growth and expediting its plans to uplist to the Nasdaq Capital Market. The timing of this investment is critical, as small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) face increasing challenges in securing loans from traditional banks, with approval rates plummeting from 83% in 2019 to 68% in 2022.

These measures are part of a broader strategy to cater to the underserved SMB sector through innovative digital solutions. The company is developing an advanced digital platform aimed at making the lending process more efficient and accessible, thereby addressing the urgent need for liquidity and growth financing among SMBs.</p><p>The alternative lending market is experiencing rapid growth, driven by inflationary pressures and high interest rates that have made traditional financing channels less accessible. FAVO's revenue-based lending platform stands out by offering SMBs quicker and more flexible access to capital, a crucial advantage in the current economic climate. With the $8 million investment, FAVO is poised to expand its operations and strengthen its foothold in the alternative lending space, offering a lifeline to SMBs struggling to navigate the complexities of today's financing landscape.</p><p>This development is not just a milestone for FAVO Capital but also a testament to the shifting dynamics in the financial services industry, where fintech companies are increasingly filling the voids left by traditional banks.
