<p>Fusion Fuel Green PLC (NASDAQ: HTOO) has made a strategic leap in its expansion strategy by announcing the acquisition of a privately held UK-based fuel distribution business for £50 million. This move is a clear indicator of the company's ambition to broaden its energy services footprint and diversify its portfolio. The acquisition, financed through £40 million in debt and £10 million in Fusion Fuel ordinary shares, targets a company with robust financial health, showcasing fiscal year 2025 revenues of $58 million and a net income of $7 million, alongside minimal existing debt.</p><p>John-Paul Backwell, CEO of Fusion Fuel Green, highlighted that this acquisition is in perfect alignment with the company's strategic vision to build a diversified and synergistic energy portfolio. It is expected to complement Fusion Fuel's existing operations, especially its Al Shola Gas brand, known for providing comprehensive industrial gas solutions. Al Shola Gas specializes in the design, supply, and maintenance of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) systems, managing LPG transport and distribution across various sectors.</p><p>Furthermore, Fusion Fuel's BrightHy platform, which focuses on innovative hydrogen solutions aimed at decarbonizing hard-to-abate industries, stands to benefit from this acquisition. This strategic move not only reinforces Fusion Fuel's commitment to growth and diversification within the energy services sector but also positions the company as a key player in the transition towards more sustainable energy solutions. The implications of this acquisition extend beyond Fusion Fuel, signaling a growing trend of consolidation and strategic partnerships in the energy sector aimed at addressing the global challenge of decarbonization.</p>
