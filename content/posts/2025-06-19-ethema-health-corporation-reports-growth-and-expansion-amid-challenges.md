<p>Ethema Health Corporation has unveiled its 2024 annual report, showcasing a period of robust financial performance and strategic expansion within the behavioral healthcare sector, particularly in substance use disorder treatment. The company reported a revenue increase to $6.02 million, up from $5.16 million the previous year, marking a 16.5% growth. This uptick is largely credited to enhanced marketing strategies at its West Palm Beach facility. However, the celebration of revenue growth is tempered by a rise in operating expenses from $5.89 million to $7.35 million, culminating in a net operating loss of $1.33 million, compared to $0.54 million in the prior year.</p><p>Among the key achievements noted in the report is the re-certification by the Joint Commission for both its West Palm Beach and Boca Raton locations. This re-certification underscores Ethema's dedication to maintaining high standards of patient care and adhering to regulatory requirements. The expansion of the Boca Raton facility, which adds 25 beds, boosts the company's total capacity in Florida to 87 beds. This expansion is expected to elevate facility utilization from 70% to 85% by the second quarter of 2025.</p><p>Ethema's strategic growth extends beyond Florida, with the completion of its acquisition of Edgewater Kentucky's treatment operations. This move introduces 347 licensed beds to its portfolio, with 275 currently operational. The Kentucky expansion is further bolstered by Medicaid approval and contracts with major Managed Care Organizations, setting the stage for substantial revenue growth. Initial operations in Kentucky have achieved 65% utilization of staffed capacity, with first-quarter revenues projected at $2.1 million.</p><p>CEO Shawn Leon addressed the challenges posed by increased operating expenses but remained optimistic about the company's trajectory. Leon highlighted the potential for future profitability through the integration of new facilities and an increase in patient numbers. Ethema aims to reach 85% utilization at its Kentucky facilities within the first year, with quarterly revenues expected to rise to $3.8 million. Despite delays in audit-related filings, Ethema is steadfast in its mission to innovate treatment programs and expand its behavioral healthcare services across North America, signaling a strong commitment to addressing the growing demand for substance use disorder treatment.</p>
