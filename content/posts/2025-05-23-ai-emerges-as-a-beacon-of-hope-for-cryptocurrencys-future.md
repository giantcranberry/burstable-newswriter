Companies such as Marathon Digital Holdings Inc. are at the forefront of this transformation, leveraging AI to realign the cryptocurrency ecosystem with its original vision.</p><p>AI's potential to revolutionize the cryptocurrency industry lies in its ability to introduce more sophisticated and transparent technological frameworks.
