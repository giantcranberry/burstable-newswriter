<p>Survale, a leader in candidate experience management solutions, has taken a significant step forward by acquiring the CandE Candidate Experience Research and Awards Program from ERE Media. This acquisition, completed earlier this month, not only expands Survale's research capabilities but also integrates Kevin Grossman, former VP of Research at ERE, into its team as Vice President of CandE Benchmark Research. This strategic move is set to redefine how organizations approach talent acquisition by leveraging comprehensive benchmark data and advanced research methodologies.</p><p>The integration of the CandE program into Survale's portfolio is a natural progression of their existing partnership, where Survale has been the technology platform for the program since 2017. Jason Moreau, CEO of Survale, highlights the acquisition's potential to enrich benchmark data, broaden the network of talent acquisition leaders, and inject valuable industry expertise into the program. For participants, this means a more seamless and enriched research experience, with access to cutting-edge features and benefits aimed at enhancing candidate experiences.</p><p>Research from the CandE program underscores the critical importance of candidate satisfaction in recruitment strategies. Findings indicate that organizations with high candidate satisfaction scores enjoy up to 60% of candidates willing to reapply, 55% more likely to refer others, and 40% becoming brand advocates. On the flip side, negative experiences can lead to significant reputational damage, with 66% of candidates sharing negative feedback and 34% posting their grievances on professional platforms. Survale's real-time feedback platform, now fully integrated with the CandE program, empowers organizations to proactively address these challenges by analyzing satisfaction data throughout the recruitment lifecycle.</p><p>This acquisition marks a pivotal moment in talent acquisition research, merging Survale's technological prowess with the CandE program's benchmarking insights. As the importance of candidate experience continues to gain recognition in achieving recruitment success, this collaboration offers organizations unparalleled insights into optimizing their talent acquisition strategies. The implications for the industry are profound, setting a new standard for how companies measure and improve their interactions with potential hires.</p>
