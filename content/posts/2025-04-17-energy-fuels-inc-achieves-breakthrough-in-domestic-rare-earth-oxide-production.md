summary = "<p>Energy Fuels (NYSE American: UUUU) (TSX: EFR) has announced it can now produce six of the seven rare earth oxides affected by new Chinese export controls, positioning its White Mesa Mill in Utah as a strategic domestic supplier. The breakthrough coincides with an April 15 executive order from President Trump directing a national security investigation into critical mineral imports. Energy Fuels believes its established infrastructure and proven production capacity uniquely qualify the Company to support U.S. supply chain resilience and fill key gaps in critical mineral processing.</p> <p>About Energy Fuels Inc. Energy Fuels is a leading U.S.-based critical minerals company, focused on uranium, rare earth elements (“REEs”), heavy mineral sands (“HMS”), vanadium and medical isotopes. The company has been the leading U.S. producer of natural uranium concentrate for the past several years, which is sold to nuclear utilities that process it further for the production of carbon-free nuclear energy, and owns and operates several conventional and in siturecovery uranium projects in the western United States. Energy Fuels also owns the White Mesa Mill in Utah, which is the only fully licensed and operating conventional uranium processing facility in the United States. At the mill, the company also produces advanced REE products and vanadium oxide (when market conditions warrant), and is preparing to begin pilot-scale recovery of certain medical isotopes from existing uranium process streams needed for emerging cancer treatments. The company also owns the operating Kwale HMS project in Kenya, which is nearing the end of its life, and is developing three additional HMS projects, including the Toliara Project in Madagascar, the Bahia Project in Brazil and the Donald Project in Australia, in which Energy Fuels has the right to earn up to a 49% interest in a joint venture with Astron Corporation Limited. The company is based in Lakewood, Colorado, with its heavy-mineral sands operations managed from Perth, Australia.

<p>Energy Fuels Inc. has reached a pivotal milestone in the domestic production of rare earth oxides, now capable of producing six out of the seven types recently impacted by Chinese export restrictions. This development at the White Mesa Mill in Utah is a strategic advancement for the U.S. mineral supply chain, addressing critical national security concerns and reducing vulnerabilities in international supply chains.</p><p>The timing of this achievement aligns with heightened awareness of the U.S.'s reliance on foreign mineral imports, underscored by an April 15 executive order calling for a thorough review of critical mineral dependencies. Energy Fuels' ability to process rare earth oxides domestically is a significant leap forward in securing the nation's technological and defense manufacturing sectors.</p><p>Rare earth elements are indispensable in a wide array of high-tech applications, from consumer electronics and renewable energy systems to advanced military hardware. The establishment of domestic production capabilities for these materials enhances the U.S.'s technological resilience and strategic independence, mitigating risks associated with global supply chain disruptions.</p><p>Energy Fuels, traditionally known for its leadership in uranium production, has demonstrated remarkable adaptability by expanding into rare earth oxide processing. This strategic pivot not only showcases the company's innovative approach but also positions it as a key player in strengthening the U.S.'s mineral processing infrastructure.</p><p>The significance of the White Mesa Mill's breakthrough extends beyond immediate economic benefits, highlighting the critical role of domestic mineral production in maintaining the U.S.'s competitive edge in technology and defense. As the global landscape of mineral supply chains continues to evolve, investments in domestic capabilities like those of Energy Fuels Inc. are essential for safeguarding national economic and strategic interests.</p>
