This initiative is designed to provide 100 local entrepreneurs with comprehensive grant packages aimed at enhancing their operational capabilities and resilience.

The announcement of winners is scheduled for August, with community partner organizations such as the Bellevue Chamber, Greater Seattle Business Association, and Seattle Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce providing free information sessions to assist potential applicants.</p><p>King County is among five regions selected by Comcast for this round of the RISE program, alongside Boston, Grand Rapids, Nashville, and South Valley. Since its inception in late 2020, the RISE program has supported 14,000 entrepreneurs across the nation, showcasing Comcast's commitment to fostering small business sustainability and growth.</p><p>This initiative is part of Comcast's larger Project UP, which seeks to create digital opportunities and support business growth.
