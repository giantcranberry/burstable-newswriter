summary = "<p>UGI Utilities is set to embark on a significant system upgrade project in Hazleton, starting June 24 on Berner Avenue, as part of its ongoing commitment to ensuring safe and reliable service. This project not only involves the replacement of a gas main but also presents an opportunity for homes and businesses along the route to switch to natural gas. The construction will necessitate the closure of Berner Avenue between South Cedar Street and South Poplar Street during work hours, with access maintained for local residents and businesses. Parking restrictions and temporary interruptions to natural gas service are expected, requiring UGI to access properties for inspection and equipment relighting. The underground work aims for completion by mid-July, pending weather and working conditions, with final paving and restoration to follow. UGI invites those interested in converting to natural gas to reach out via phone or email at <a href=\"mailto:gasconversion@ugi.com\">gasconversion@ugi.com</a>. UGI Utilities, Inc., serving over 760,000 customers, continues to prioritize infrastructure improvements and customer service.

<p>UGI Utilities has initiated a critical infrastructure upgrade in Hazleton, targeting the replacement of an aging gas main on Berner Avenue. This project, set to commence on June 24, underscores UGI's commitment to ensuring the safety and reliability of its natural gas distribution system. The upgrade, occurring between South Cedar Street and South Poplar Street, is a proactive measure to prevent potential service disruptions and enhance the overall efficiency of the gas supply to the community.</p><p>The construction schedule, running from 7am to 5pm on weekdays, will inevitably lead to temporary inconveniences, including road closures and parking restrictions. UGI has assured that while access for residents and businesses within the construction zone will be maintained, some natural gas service interruptions are expected. The company plans to conduct necessary inspections and relight equipment on properties affected by the service restoration process, emphasizing its dedication to minimizing disruption.</p><p>With an estimated completion date in mid-July, the project's timeline is subject to variations due to weather and unforeseen working conditions. Following the underground work, UGI will undertake final paving and restoration efforts to ensure the area is returned to its original state. This project not only represents a significant investment in the local infrastructure but also offers an opportunity for the community to consider the benefits of natural gas. UGI is actively encouraging homes and businesses along the project route to explore converting to natural gas, highlighting its advantages as a cleaner and more efficient energy source.</p><p>As a utility provider serving over 760,000 customers, UGI's initiative in Hazleton is a testament to its broader mission of delivering reliable energy solutions through continuous infrastructure improvements.
