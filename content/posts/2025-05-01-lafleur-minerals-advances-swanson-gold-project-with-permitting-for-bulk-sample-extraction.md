<p>LaFleur Minerals has taken a significant step forward in its exploration efforts at the Swanson Gold Project located in Quebec's prolific Abitibi Gold Belt. The company has initiated the permitting process to extract a 100,000-tonne surface bulk sample from the deposit. This move is pivotal as the Swanson Gold Project boasts an indicated resource of 123,400 ounces of gold and an inferred resource of 64,500 ounces of gold, marking a substantial opportunity for gold extraction and processing.</p><p>The strategic decision to process the mineralized material at LaFleur's fully permitted Beacon Gold Mill, situated merely 50 kilometers from the deposit, underscores the company's innovative approach to generating near-term cash flow while advancing its exploration objectives. The Beacon Gold Mill, with a capacity to process over 750 tonnes of material daily, not only serves LaFleur's immediate needs but also positions the company as a potential service provider for custom milling operations for neighboring gold projects.</p><p>LaFleur Minerals has set an ambitious timeline to restart the mill and commence gold production by the end of 2025. The processing of the bulk sample is expected to yield critical data that will inform a comprehensive scoping study, assessing the project's viability for future production. This initiative is a testament to LaFleur's commitment to leveraging existing infrastructure to minimize environmental impact and operational costs while maximizing resource utilization.</p><p>The Swanson Gold Project's expansive 16,000-hectare property, which includes several gold and critical metal prospects, benefits from excellent accessibility by road and proximity to a rail line. This logistical advantage enhances the project's development potential, offering direct access to nearby gold mills and facilitating efficient material transport. LaFleur Minerals' approach to the Swanson Gold Project exemplifies a forward-thinking strategy in mineral exploration and processing, with implications for the local economy, the gold mining industry, and stakeholders interested in sustainable and efficient resource development.</p>
