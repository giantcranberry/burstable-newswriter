<p>In a significant development for the journalism and technology sectors, Featured.com has announced its acquisition of Help A Reporter Out (HARO) from Cision. This move underscores a growing emphasis on the importance of human expertise in an era increasingly dominated by AI-generated content. HARO, established in 2008, has long served as a critical bridge between journalists seeking expert sources and professionals eager to contribute their knowledge through earned media.</p><p>Brett Farmiloe, Founder and CEO of Featured, highlighted the acquisition's timing as a direct response to the challenges posed by the proliferation of AI-generated content. "As AI floods the internet with generic content, journalists need credible, human sources more than ever," Farmiloe remarked. This acquisition not only reaffirms Featured.com's commitment to facilitating genuine human connections in journalism but also aims to preserve the integrity of media reporting by ensuring access to authentic expert insights.</p><p>The revived HARO platform will continue to operate under its original free model for both journalists and sources, supported by newsletter advertisements. It will maintain its daily email delivery of opportunities, enabling reporters to efficiently submit queries and receive responses from relevant experts. This model has been instrumental in fostering a community-driven approach to journalism, a factor that attracted investors like Great North Ventures. Rob Weber, Managing Partner at Great North Ventures, expressed confidence in the platform's mission, stating, "This investment reflects our belief in platforms that strengthen trusted connections between experts and creators."</p><p>Featured.com's broader mission revolves around making expert knowledge more accessible. With a community exceeding 50,000 experts and over 1 million submitted answers, the platform plays a pivotal role in powering articles across a network of more than 2,500 media outlets. The acquisition of HARO is a testament to Featured.com's dedication to counteracting the influx of AI-generated content and upholding the significance of human-driven expertise in journalism. This development is poised to have a profound impact on the industry, reinforcing the value of authentic connections in an increasingly digital world.</p>
