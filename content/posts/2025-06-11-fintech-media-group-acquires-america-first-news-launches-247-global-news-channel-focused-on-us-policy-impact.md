Additionally, the channel will dedicate resources to accountability journalism, investigating inefficiencies and misconduct within federal agencies. This initiative will utilize data from the Government Accountability Office (GAO), inspector general audits, and real-world case studies to evaluate the effectiveness of the Department of Government Oversight & Efficiency (DOGE) and its impact on taxpayers.</p><p>The AFN Liberty & Leadership Awards will serve as a highlight of the channel's content, recognizing individuals and organizations that have made significant contributions to American economic interests and community resilience. Categories for the awards include Job Creation, Mutual Investment, Tech Sovereignty, Border & Immigration Policy, Government Accountability, and Local Champions & Veteran Leadership.
