<p>Nicola Mining Inc. has embarked on a transformative operational strategy by commencing the processing of high-grade gold and silver ore from Talisker Resources at its Merritt Mill in British Columbia. This facility, upgraded at a cost of $33 million, stands as the only mill in the province currently permitted to accept third-party precious metal feed, underscoring a significant milestone in the company's expansion efforts.</p><p>With full production capacity expected by the third quarter of 2025, Nicola Mining is not only focusing on immediate processing capabilities but is also in the process of securing a permit amendment to enhance mill throughput. This initiative reflects the company's dedication to evolving into a versatile and efficient processing hub for diverse mining projects.</p><p>Beyond Talisker Resources, Nicola Mining is gearing up to process ore from Blue Lagoon Resources' Dome Mountain Mine and is making strides with a bulk sample at its Dominion Creek project, where it holds a 75% interest. These efforts are part of a broader strategy to diversify its resource portfolio and solidify its market position.</p><p>Exploration is also a key focus, with the company intensifying efforts at the New Craigmont Copper Project and bolstering its team with the appointment of Vicente Garc√≠a as Senior Geologist. This move highlights Nicola Mining's commitment to leveraging technical expertise and geological exploration to uncover new opportunities.</p><p>CEO Peter Espig emphasized the strategic importance of the company's fully permitted infrastructure and the potential for enduring partnerships. The Merritt Mill's capability to process both gold and silver through various methods positions Nicola Mining as a flexible and adaptive entity in the mining industry.</p><p>Nicola Mining's portfolio is further strengthened by its 100% ownership of the New Craigmont Project, a high-grade copper property adjacent to Highland Valley Copper, Canada's largest copper mine. This strategic location offers considerable potential for future development, aligning with the company's long-term growth objectives.</p><p>Through its calculated approach to resource processing and exploration, Nicola Mining is leveraging its unique infrastructure and strategic partnerships to carve out a significant role in the mining sector, promising to deliver value and innovation in the years to come.</p>
