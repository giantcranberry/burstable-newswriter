<p>The global surge in demand for high-performance data centers has unveiled a significant vulnerability: the degradation of concrete infrastructure. Kryton International, a pioneer in concrete waterproofing and durability solutions, emphasizes the urgent need for ultra-durable, waterproof concrete to safeguard the uptime and longevity of these critical facilities. With data center outages costing an average of $9,000 per minute, the financial implications of infrastructure failures are staggering. Even minor issues, such as hairline cracks leading to water ingress, can rapidly escalate, causing server damage, power infrastructure failures, and in severe cases, structural collapses.</p><p>Kari Yuers, President & CEO of Kryton International, sheds light on the often-overlooked dynamic vulnerabilities of concrete within data centers. The traditional concrete's propensity for microcracking, water penetration, and abrasion presents substantial risks, particularly as facilities increasingly incorporate robotics and automation. These technologies introduce additional stresses to concrete, from abrasion caused by wheeled traffic to the vast amounts of water utilized in cooling systems, which can lead to seepage and further structural degradation.</p><p>Kryton offers innovative solutions like the Krystol Internal Membrane™ (KIM®) and Hard-Cem® admixtures, which enhance concrete's self-sealing, waterproofing, and abrasion resistance capabilities. These advancements are especially pertinent as data centers expand into areas with challenging environmental conditions, such as high water tables, seismic activity, or extreme temperature fluctuations, all of which can accelerate concrete deterioration. Implementing such advanced concrete solutions during the construction phase can avert expensive shutdowns, ensuring operational resilience by protecting against moisture damage, structural wear, and energy inefficiencies.</p><p>This push for higher concrete standards coincides with the evolution of data centers to meet the processing demands of AI systems and the efficiency gains from robotics. Kryton International's advocacy for durable concrete underscores the industry's imperative to invest in infrastructure capable of enduring not only the passage of time but also the operational rigors of contemporary data centers. By doing so, the sector can achieve greater reliability, efficiency, and sustainability, addressing the challenges posed by an increasingly digital world.</p>
