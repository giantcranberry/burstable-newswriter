<p>UGI Utilities has unveiled plans for a comprehensive system upgrade in Hazleton, marking a significant step towards enhancing the city's utility infrastructure and offering residents and businesses the chance to convert to natural gas. The project, kicking off on June 2, will focus on replacing gas mains along key city streets, including South Bennett Court and East Birch Street, with completion anticipated by late June.</p><p>The initiative is expected to bring about considerable disruptions, including road closures, detours, and traffic delays, as construction will take place from 7 am to 5 pm, Monday through Friday. Property owners in the affected areas may also experience temporary interruptions to their natural gas service, necessitating cooperation with UGI Utilities for equipment inspection and relighting post-construction.</p><p>Beyond the immediate inconveniences, the project underscores UGI Utilities' dedication to ensuring the safety and reliability of its services. Moreover, it presents a unique opportunity for properties along the project route to transition to natural gas systems, potentially leading to improved energy efficiency and expanded service options. This move could have lasting benefits for the community, aligning with broader environmental and economic goals by promoting cleaner energy use.</p><p>The completion of road paving and site restoration will follow the main construction phase, dependent on weather and working conditions. This project not only highlights the importance of maintaining and upgrading critical infrastructure but also reflects the growing shift towards more sustainable energy solutions in urban development.</p>
