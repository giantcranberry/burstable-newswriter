<p>MARK Capital Management has recently been honored as the Logistics Investor of the Year by PERE, a testament to its successful fundraising efforts for the Crossbay II fund, which garnered €660 million in equity commitments. This achievement not only marks a 20% increase from its predecessor but also highlights the robust investor confidence in the firm's strategic focus on urban logistics within major European gateway cities.</p><p>The Crossbay II fund, with a total investment capacity surpassing €1.5 billion, is strategically aimed at acquiring single-user distribution warehouses. Its investor base is a diverse mix of institutional participants, including pension funds, sovereign wealth funds, and family offices from across Europe, Asia, and the United States. According to PERE, this fund is among the top 10 largest industrial and logistics private real estate funds globally and stands as the largest Europe-focused vehicle to reach final close.</p><p>With approximately €1 billion in assets under management, the fund's investments are spread across key European markets such as the United Kingdom, France, Benelux, Germany, Spain, and Italy. MARK Capital Management's foray into the urban logistics sector began in 2018 with its initial Crossbay fund, which secured €550 million in equity commitments and successfully exited in 2022. The current fund is already over 65% committed, having acquired more than 7.5 million square feet of property.</p><p>CEO Marcus Meijer emphasized the firm's unique strategy, which is rooted in deep local market expertise and the ability to source off-market opportunities. This cycle-agnostic approach, supported by pan-European origination capabilities and specialized infrastructure, has been pivotal in the firm's success. Since its inception in 2008, MARK Capital Management has managed over €20 billion in private real estate, catering to a global clientele of institutional investors with a focus on value maximization through localized knowledge and strategic investments.</p><p>This development is significant for the logistics and real estate sectors, as it underscores the growing investor interest in urban logistics as a resilient and high-growth area. The success of the Crossbay II fund not only solidifies MARK Capital Management's position as a leader in the European logistics real estate market but also signals a broader trend towards strategic investments in logistics infrastructure to meet the evolving demands of global commerce.</p>
