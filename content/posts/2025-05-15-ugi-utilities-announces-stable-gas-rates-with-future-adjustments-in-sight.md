<p>UGI Utilities, Inc. has made a significant announcement regarding its gas cost rates, stating that they will remain unchanged until June 1, 2025, with a projected increase set for December 1, 2025. This decision comes as part of the utility's annual filing with the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission (PUC), a regulatory requirement that ensures transparency and fairness in rate adjustments. The utility's approach to rate adjustments is strictly regulated, with no profit allowed on the natural gas commodity portion of customer bills, ensuring that any changes directly reflect wholesale natural gas price fluctuations.</p><p>The anticipated rate adjustment in December 2025 is expected to result in modest bill increases across all customer segments. Residential customers, for instance, could see their monthly bills increase by 1.1%, while commercial and industrial customers might face hikes of 1.4% and 1.5%, respectively. These adjustments are calculated based on average usage, highlighting the utility's commitment to minimizing financial impact on its customers.</p><p>Understanding the potential challenges these adjustments may pose, UGI Utilities has emphasized its range of customer support mechanisms. These include budget billing options, various payment platforms, and an auto-pay program, all designed to ease the management of utility bills. Additionally, the utility is actively promoting energy efficiency and offers resources to help customers reduce their energy consumption. For those with limited or fixed incomes, UGI Utilities provides information on energy assistance programs, underscoring its dedication to supporting all customers through changes in rates.</p><p>With a service area covering more than 760,000 natural gas and electric customers across 45 Pennsylvania counties, UGI Utilities' announcement is a critical update for a significant portion of the state's population. The utility's proactive communication and support initiatives reflect its commitment to customer service and transparency, ensuring that customers are well-informed and supported in managing their utility expenses.</p>
