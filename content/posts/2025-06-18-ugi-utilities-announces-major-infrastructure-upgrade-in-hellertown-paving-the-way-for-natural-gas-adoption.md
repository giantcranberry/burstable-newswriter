<p>UGI Utilities has unveiled plans for a substantial infrastructure upgrade in Hellertown, set to commence the week of June 9, 2025. This initiative is a testament to UGI's commitment to ensuring the safety and reliability of its utility services, while also facilitating the transition of select homes and businesses to natural gas, a move that aligns with global energy efficiency and sustainability efforts.</p><p>The upgrade project will focus on Easton Road, stretching between Lower Saucon Road and Cherry Lane, with construction activities planned from 7 am Monday through Saturday. To minimize disruption, lane closures will be implemented between 9 am and 3 pm from Cherry Lane to Countryside Lane, with traffic flow managed by flaggers. Nightly closures of both lanes on Easton Road from 6 pm to 6 am, Sunday through Friday, between Cherry Lane and Lower Saucon Road, are also scheduled, though access for local residents and businesses will be maintained throughout. The underground work on Easton Road is projected to be completed by the end of October.</p><p>Additionally, Ringhoffer Road between Easton Road and Sherry Hill Road will be closed 24/7 starting mid-June, with underground work expected to wrap up by the end of the same month. Property owners should be aware of potential temporary interruptions to natural gas service, as UGI may need to access properties for equipment inspection and relighting purposes.</p><p>While the completion dates are contingent upon weather and working conditions, the project's overarching goal remains clear: to modernize infrastructure and provide a seamless transition to natural gas for eligible properties. This initiative not only promises to enhance the reliability of utility services in Hellertown but also represents a forward-looking approach to energy consumption, offering a cleaner, more sustainable alternative to traditional energy sources.</p><p>The implications of this upgrade are far-reaching, offering both immediate and long-term benefits. For the local community, the project means improved utility reliability and the opportunity to embrace natural gas, a cleaner energy source. On a broader scale, this initiative reflects a growing industry trend towards sustainability and energy efficiency, setting a precedent for future infrastructure projects nationwide.</p>
