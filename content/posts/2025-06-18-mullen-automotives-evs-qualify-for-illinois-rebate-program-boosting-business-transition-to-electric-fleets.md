<p>Mullen Automotive Inc. (NASDAQ: MULN) has achieved a significant milestone with its commercial electric vehicles (EVs) now being eligible for incentives under Illinois' ComEd Business & Public Sector EV Rebate Program. This eligibility enables businesses purchasing Mullen vehicles through authorized dealers to receive up to $7,500 per Mullen ONE Class 1 cargo van. When these rebates are combined with federal tax credits, the total savings can escalate to $15,000, presenting a compelling financial incentive for businesses to adopt electric fleets.</p><p>The ComEd program also includes provisions for medium-duty EVs, which could qualify for rebates as high as $30,000. However, the overwhelming demand has led to a waitlist for these rebates. This program adds to the existing state-level incentives in California and Massachusetts, offering businesses more opportunities to reduce costs associated with fleet electrification and highlighting the increasing governmental support for sustainable transportation solutions.</p><p>Mullen Automotive, headquartered in Southern California, is making notable progress in the commercial EV sector. The company's production facilities in Mississippi and Indiana are instrumental in its mission to lead the next generation of electric commercial vehicles. The Mullen ONE and Mullen THREE, both CARB and EPA certified, are now available nationwide, with the latter eligible for a CARB-issued HVIP approval offering up to $45,000 in cash vouchers at purchase.</p><p>The expansion of Mullen's dealer network to seven dealers ensures widespread sales and service coverage across the U.S., further facilitated by the Foreign Trade Zone status of its Tunica manufacturing center. This strategic positioning underscores Mullen Automotive's role in advancing greener commercial transportation options.</p><p>This development is particularly impactful for businesses aiming to lower their carbon footprint and operational expenses through electrification. The availability of these incentives not only makes the transition to electric vehicles more economically feasible but also aligns with environmental objectives and the growing emphasis on sustainable business practices.</p>
