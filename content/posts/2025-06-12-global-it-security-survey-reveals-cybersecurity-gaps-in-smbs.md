<p>The fifth annual global IT security survey conducted by Devolutions, a leading provider of Privileged Access Management (PAM) and password management tools for small and mid-sized businesses (SMBs), has unveiled critical insights into the cybersecurity landscape for SMBs. The survey, which collected responses from IT professionals and security leaders across the globe, reveals a significant gap between awareness of cyber threats and the operational maturity to combat them effectively.</p><p>One of the most striking findings is that 52% of SMBs still depend on spreadsheets or shared vaults for managing privileged access, a method fraught with security vulnerabilities. Despite 71% of respondents feeling confident in their ability to handle a cyber incident, only 22% have achieved an advanced security posture. This discrepancy highlights the urgent need for security solutions that are not only robust but also accessible and scalable for SMBs.</p><p>Another area of concern is the slow adoption of AI in cybersecurity among SMBs. While 71% plan to increase their use of AI, 40% currently do not utilize it at all. Additionally, insider threats, recognized by 78% of SMBs as a significant risk, are only formally addressed by 20%. These findings underscore the necessity for SMBs to translate their cybersecurity awareness into actionable strategies.</p><p>Maxime Trottier, Chief Revenue Officer at Devolutions, highlighted how the survey's insights are shaping the company's approach to product development. By focusing on making PAM solutions more accessible and enhancing educational initiatives through Devolutions Academy, the company aims to address the underlying reasons behind security decisions. The survey has already made an impact, serving as a crucial resource for IT professionals seeking to bolster their cybersecurity measures without overcomplicating their operations.</p><p>Devolutions' commitment to bridging the gap between security and usability for SMBs has been recognized with its designation as a 2025 Champion in Info-Tech’s Emotional Footprint Report for PAM. This accolade, based on user feedback, reaffirms the company's mission to deliver practical, affordable, and powerful cybersecurity solutions tailored to the needs of SMBs.</p>
