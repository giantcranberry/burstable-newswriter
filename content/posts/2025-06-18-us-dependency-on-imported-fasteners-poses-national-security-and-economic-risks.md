summary = "<p>Mike McGuire, a Fastener Hall of Fame inductee and founder of Worldwide Fastener Sources and US Fastener Sources, highlights a critical issue facing the United States: the majority of mechanical fasteners used in the country are imported, primarily from China and Taiwan. This reliance on foreign manufacturing poses significant risks, including military vulnerabilities and high-profile product failures. McGuire points out that the U.S. no longer produces its most common finished hex nut, the ¼-20, and that not one mechanical or civil engineering program in the country includes formal training in fasteners or fastening application engineering. In response, McGuire is partnering with Trident Technical College to launch a formal course in Fastening Application Engineering and developing The Fastening Application Guide to address this gap. The situation is further exacerbated by a shrinking domestic workforce of skilled machinists, essential for fastener production, putting U.S. defense contractors and OEMs at the mercy of foreign suppliers. McGuire emphasizes the national security implications of this issue, recalling the U.S.'s significant fastener production capacity during World War II and warning of the potential paralysis of American manufacturing in times of crisis. He also notes the high cost of fastener failures, with 80% of vehicle recalls being fastener-related, and calls for a reevaluation of fasteners as 'Critical' components rather than 'Class C'. McGuire's extensive contributions to the fastener industry underscore his call to action for industry stakeholders, educators, and policymakers to invest in fastener education and bring back production to American soil.</p>"

<p>The United States is facing a critical challenge as its dependence on imported fasteners reaches alarming levels, with more than 85% of standard, commercial fasteners used domestically sourced from abroad, mainly China and Taiwan. This reliance not only poses significant economic risks but also raises serious national security concerns, as highlighted by Mike McGuire, a Fastener Hall of Fame inductee and founder of Worldwide Fastener Sources and US Fastener Sources.</p><p>The Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) is increasingly encountering a 'No Bid' list for fasteners that are no longer produced in sufficient quantity or quality within the U.S. This shortage includes common items such as the ¼-20 finished hex nut and drywall screws, underscoring the vulnerability of U.S. manufacturing to disruptions in the global supply chain. The situation is further complicated by a notable gap in the U.S. education system, where mechanical and civil engineering programs lack formal education in fasteners or fastening application engineering, threatening the future of American engineering and manufacturing.</p><p>In response to these challenges, McGuire is working with Trident Technical College to develop a course in Fastening Application Engineering and creating The Fastening Application Guide to encourage innovative uses of specialty fasteners. These initiatives aim to bridge the knowledge gap and revitalize interest in fastener technology among future engineers.</p><p>The implications of neglecting domestic fastener production and education are profound. During World War II, the U.S. produced 170 million fasteners daily, a capacity that was vital for the war effort. Today, domestic production is a fraction of that, with a shrinking workforce skilled in the necessary manufacturing processes. This decline not only affects defense contractors and original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) but also results in expensive recalls and failures, with 80% of vehicle recalls linked to fastener-related issues.</p><p>McGuire's extensive contributions to the fastener industry, including his induction into the Fastener Hall of Fame and the development of educational tools like the Fastener Quiz and the Industrial Fastener Study Guide, reflect his dedication to addressing this crisis. He urges immediate action from industry leaders, educators, and policymakers to reinvest in domestic fastener production and education, stressing that the future of American manufacturing and national security hinges on these essential components.</p>
