<p>Frequency Forward, a public-interest organization, has taken a significant step by petitioning the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to halt Sinclair, Inc.'s proposed transfer of five broadcast licenses to Rincon Broadcasting Group. The petition raises serious concerns about Sinclair's alleged systematic evasion of multiple ownership rules and repeated misrepresentations to regulatory bodies. This move underscores the ongoing debate over media ownership and the integrity of regulatory compliance in the broadcasting industry.</p><p>The crux of the petition revolves around Sinclair's purported use of shell corporations, such as Cunningham Broadcasting and Deerfield Media, to bypass FCC ownership restrictions. Frequency Forward argues that these entities function as a 'shadow network,' designed to circumvent federal regulations rather than operate as independent broadcasters. The stations involved in the challenged license transfers are KHQA in Quincy, KTVO in Kirksville, WICS in Springfield, WICD in Danville, and WVTV in Milwaukee, spanning Illinois, Missouri, and Wisconsin.</p><p>Attorney Arthur Belendiuk points to evidence suggesting Sinclair has consistently obscured its ownership structures and misled regulatory authorities. The petition also criticizes a 2020 $48 million consent decree between Sinclair and the FCC, deeming it inappropriate and highlighting new evidence obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request. This evidence allegedly shows Sinclair's continued misrepresentations during regulatory investigations, raising questions about the company's compliance and the FCC's oversight mechanisms.</p><p>Frequency Forward's action challenges the public interest standard essential for broadcast licensing, urging the FCC to scrutinize whether Sinclair merits retaining its broadcast licenses given the alleged pattern of regulatory deception. The organization calls for a comprehensive FCC hearing to examine Sinclair's corporate structures, financial relationships, and adherence to ownership regulations. The outcome of this petition could not only prevent the proposed license transfers but also set a precedent for how media ownership standards are enforced, potentially reshaping the landscape of broadcast media ownership in the United States.</p>
