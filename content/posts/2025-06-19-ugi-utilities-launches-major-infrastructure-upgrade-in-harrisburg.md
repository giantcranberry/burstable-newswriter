<p>UGI Utilities has announced the commencement of a critical infrastructure upgrade project in Harrisburg, focusing on the natural gas infrastructure near the state capitol. This initiative is part of the company's broader effort to ensure the safety and reliability of utility services for its extensive customer base. The project, which involves the replacement of main and service lines across eight key street segments, is expected to continue through the end of June, with construction crews working daily, including weekends.</p><p>The affected areas include North 10th Street, Walnut Street, North Court Street, North 2nd Street, North 3rd Street, Pine Street, South Street, and Oliver Alley. Residents, drivers, and business owners in these areas should prepare for potential disruptions, including road closures, detours, traffic delays, and parking restrictions. Additionally, some property owners may face temporary interruptions in natural gas service, requiring inspections and possible relightings by UGI technicians.</p><p>The timeline for the project's completion may vary depending on weather conditions and the progress of on-site work. Following the underground infrastructure improvements, UGI Utilities plans to undertake paving and restoration efforts to ensure the streets are returned to their original condition. This project highlights the critical role of proactive infrastructure maintenance in safeguarding community utility reliability and underscores UGI Utilities' commitment to its customers.</p><p>For the over 760,000 customers served by UGI Utilities, these upgrades represent a vital step towards modernizing the natural gas infrastructure, reducing the risk of outages, and ensuring the long-term reliability of utility services. The project's impact extends beyond immediate inconveniences, offering a glimpse into the ongoing efforts required to maintain and improve critical infrastructure in urban areas.</p>
