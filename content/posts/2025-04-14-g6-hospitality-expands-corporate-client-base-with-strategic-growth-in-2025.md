<p>G6 Hospitality, the parent company of Motel 6 and Studio 6, has marked a significant milestone in 2025 by expanding its corporate client base with over 150 new accounts, a move that has contributed to a 26% revenue increase in the first quarter compared to the previous year. This growth is attributed to the company's aggressive business development strategy, which involved more than 500 meetings with potential and existing corporate clients across various industries.</p><p>The hospitality franchisor's strategy has focused on sectors such as construction, transportation, and agriculture, targeting businesses with annual booking potentials ranging from $15,000 to over $1 million. By adding approximately 50 new corporate accounts each month since January, G6 Hospitality has not only diversified its client base but also ensured consistent occupancy across its network. CEO Sonal Sinha highlighted the importance of these corporate relationships in driving the company's growth and stability.</p><p>One of the standout successes of this strategy is the Natson Hotel Group, a franchise partner of G6 Hospitality, which saw over 200% growth in corporate revenue during the same period. Corporate clients enjoy several benefits, including average discounts of 10-12%, 30-day credit facilities, and dedicated customer service. The convenience of booking through the My6 app and website, coupled with automatic discounts via corporate profile codes, has made G6 Hospitality a preferred choice for business travelers.</p><p>Looking ahead, G6 Hospitality plans to continue its corporate expansion by re-engaging former clients and extending contracts with existing accounts from 2024. With nearly 1,500 economy lodging locations across the United States and Canada, the company is well-positioned to maintain its growth trajectory. Its recognition in the 2024 Entrepreneur Franchise 500Â® report and as a 2024 Leader in Diversity by Dallas Business Journal further underscores its commitment to exceptional service and inclusive business practices.</p><p>This strategic corporate growth not only benefits G6 Hospitality but also sets a benchmark for the hospitality industry, demonstrating the value of diversifying client bases and enhancing services for business travelers. The implications of this expansion are significant, offering insights into how targeted business development efforts can lead to substantial revenue growth and industry recognition.</p>
