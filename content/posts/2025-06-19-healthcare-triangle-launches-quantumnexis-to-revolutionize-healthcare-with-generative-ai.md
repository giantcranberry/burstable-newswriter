<p>Healthcare Triangle, Inc. has taken a significant step forward in the healthcare technology sector with the launch of QuantumNexis, a subsidiary dedicated to pioneering generative AI-powered healthcare software solutions. This strategic move is bolstered by the simultaneous acquisitions of Niyama Healthcare and Ezovion Solutions, two tech firms with specialized platforms in digital mental wellness and hospital management, respectively. The initiative underscores the company's commitment to addressing pressing healthcare challenges through technological innovation.</p><p>Niyama Healthcare contributes a personalized generative AI mental health platform that utilizes extensive data analytics across psychological, physical, and behavioral domains. This platform has already made strides in various healthcare disciplines, including psychiatry and nutrition, serving over 5,000 clients in its pilot phase.
