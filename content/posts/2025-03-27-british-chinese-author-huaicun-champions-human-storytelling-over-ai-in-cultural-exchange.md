<p>At a recent cultural exchange event in London, supported by the Chinese Embassy in the UK, British-Chinese children's author Huaicun made a compelling case for the enduring significance of human storytelling in the face of advancing artificial intelligence technologies. Huaicun's argument centered on the idea that true literary creativity is born from lived experiences, emotional memories, and genuine human connections, elements that AI cannot authentically replicate.</p><p>The event, which drew nearly one hundred attendees from both Chinese and British cultural communities, served as a platform for Huaicun to discuss the unique capacity of writers to navigate and express the nuanced landscape of human feelings. She was joined by notable figures such as Guy Portelli, Vice President of the Royal Society of British Artists, and Xuemo, a renowned Chinese writer whose works have been translated into over 20 languages. Together, they underscored the universal nature of human experiences and the importance of preserving humanistic values in an era of rapid technological transformation.</p><p>Huaicun particularly highlighted the role of children's literature in cultivating fundamental human qualities like kindness, curiosity, and creativity. She argued that these attributes are essential foundations of human civilization and should not be compromised by technological advancement. This perspective offers a critical reflection on the balance between embracing new technologies and maintaining the emotional intelligence that defines humanity.</p><p>The dialogue between Huaicun and Xuemo not only reinforced the importance of literature as a bridge across global divides but also presented a nuanced perspective on the relationship between technological innovation and human creativity. By focusing on emotion and lived experience, they made a compelling argument for the continued relevance of literature in an increasingly digital world, challenging the notion that AI could ever replace the profound depth of human storytelling.</p>
