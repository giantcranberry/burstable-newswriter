<p>ESGold Corp. has achieved a significant milestone in the development of its Montauban project located in Quebec, by installing Humphrey spiral concentrators. This innovative technology enables gravity separation for the recovery of gold and silver from historic tailings, showcasing the company's commitment to sustainable and environmentally friendly mining practices. With a targeted processing throughput of up to 1,000 tonnes per day, this project is a cornerstone of ESGold's clean mining strategy.</p><p>Paul Mastantuono, CEO of ESGold Corp., has confirmed that the project's construction is on schedule, with the first production expected by the end of 2025. This development not only underscores ESGold's dedication to sustainable resource recovery but also leverages the company's proven expertise in Quebec's rich mining landscape. The Montauban project is strategically positioned 80 kilometers west of Quebec City, offering near-term production potential and extensive district-scale exploration opportunities.</p><p>The timing of this milestone is particularly noteworthy, as it coincides with a period of robust performance in Canada's gold production sector. Canada is currently the fourth-largest gold-producing country in the world, with industry giants such as Barrick Gold, Kinross Gold, and B2Gold reporting strong first-quarter results in 2025. ESGold's progress at Montauban places it at the forefront of innovative mining technologies and sustainable practices in this competitive landscape.</p><p>In addition to the installation of the gravity separation circuit, ESGold is preparing an updated Preliminary Economic Assessment (PEA) and plans to release a detailed 3D geological model in the near future. These steps are critical for evaluating the project's economic viability and exploration potential. By focusing on historic tailings, ESGold not only aims to generate a new revenue stream but also addresses environmental concerns associated with traditional mining methods, setting a new standard for the industry.</p><p>The implications of ESGold's advancements at the Montauban project are far-reaching. For the mining industry, it represents a shift towards more sustainable and efficient resource extraction methods. For investors and stakeholders, it offers a glimpse into the future of mining, where environmental responsibility and profitability go hand in hand. As ESGold continues to innovate and expand its operations, the Montauban project stands as a testament to the potential of clean mining technologies to reshape the industry.</p>
