<p>Clarion Partners, LLC has taken a significant step in the industrial real estate sector by leasing 161,200 square feet at 500 Denmark Drive within the Tahoe Reno Industrial Center (TRIC) to MEI Industrial Solutions. This lease agreement not only signifies a major expansion for MEI in Northern Nevada but also enhances its service capabilities through additional indoor and outdoor storage space.

Clarion Partners' acquisition of this property in July 2024 has significantly increased its industrial footprint in the Reno area to over 1.7 million square feet. This move also represents Clarion's initial investment in Sparks, NV, a dynamic submarket and a Federally designated Qualified Opportunity Zone (QOZ), highlighting the firm's strategic focus on high-growth areas.</p><p>Jason Glasser, Managing Director at Clarion Partners, shared his optimism about MEI's choice to establish operations at 500 Denmark Drive, citing Reno's advantageous position as a high-growth submarket with easy access to major transportation routes. This partnership is mutually beneficial, with Clarion strengthening its industrial real estate portfolio and MEI boosting its operational efficiency in a critical region. Clarion Partners' extensive real estate assets, including significant investments in QOZs and adjacent submarkets, underscore its leadership in the industrial sector. The firm's global industrial team manages a portfolio of about 1,000 properties across the U.S. and Europe, encompassing more than 250 million square feet.
