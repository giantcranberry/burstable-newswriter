<p>The economic landscape may be on the brink of a transformative shift as a new proposal leverages artificial intelligence to introduce a novel wealth distribution mechanism. The People's Autonomous Economy, as it's called, proposes the use of Consumer Earned Tokenized Equities (CETEs) to ensure that economic value is more equitably distributed among participants in commercial transactions. This initiative directly addresses the widening wealth gap, a byproduct of rapid technological advancements, by embedding redistribution into the very fabric of economic transactions.</p><p>At the heart of this proposal is the mathematical formula M = αF, which posits that once CETE-backed transactions constitute about 40% of total economic activity, the monetary system undergoes a fundamental change. This shift would see the value of currency anchored in actual economic activity rather than the traditional reliance on governmental faith. Such a change could redefine the principles of modern economics, making the system more inclusive and sustainable.</p><p>The proposal specifically calls upon AI giants OpenAI and Anthropic to take a leadership role in implementing this model. It argues that these companies, at the forefront of technological innovation, bear a moral obligation to ensure their advancements benefit society at large. By adopting CETEs, they could pioneer a system where technological progress does not exacerbate inequality but instead fosters a more equitable distribution of wealth.</p><p>Key to the proposal's implementation are pilot programs across varied economic settings, the development of AI governance frameworks that integrate with economic structures, and the endorsement of tech leaders. The architects stress that their model is not about charity but about restructuring economic participation to ensure that everyone benefits from the digital economy.</p><p>While the vision is ambitious, its realization hinges on widespread cooperation from both technological and economic institutions. The proposal challenges conventional economic paradigms by advocating for a mathematically grounded approach to value redistribution, potentially setting a new standard for how economies operate in the age of AI.</p>
