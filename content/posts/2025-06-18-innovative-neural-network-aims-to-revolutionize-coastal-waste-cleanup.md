<p>The collaboration between Yandex B2B Tech, Yandex School of Data Analysis, and the Far Eastern Federal University (FEFU) has yielded a groundbreaking neural network aimed at tackling the pressing issue of marine pollution. This technology, which has been successfully tested in the South Kamchatka Federal Nature Reserve, is now being extended to the Arctic and other remote areas, marking a significant step forward in environmental conservation efforts.</p><p>Marine pollution, with over 11 million tons of plastic waste entering the oceans each year, is a critical environmental challenge. The situation is expected to worsen, with projections indicating a rise to 29 million tons by 2040 if no action is taken. The neural network developed by these institutions offers a promising solution by automating the detection and analysis of waste, thereby significantly improving the efficiency of cleanup operations. In initial deployments, the technology enabled volunteer teams to remove 5 tons of waste four times faster than traditional methods, showcasing its potential to revolutionize waste management in remote coastal regions.</p><p>The open-source nature of this neural network allows for global adoption and customization, making it a versatile tool for environmental agencies and volunteers worldwide. With an accuracy rate of over 80% in waste detection, the technology leverages computer vision and semantic image segmentation to map and remove pollutants effectively. This initiative not only highlights the role of artificial intelligence in addressing environmental challenges but also emphasizes the importance of collaborative innovation in creating sustainable solutions.</p><p>As the project expands to Far Eastern and Arctic national parks, the neural network stands as a testament to the potential of technology in combating marine pollution. By providing a cost-effective and efficient alternative to labor-intensive cleanup methods, this development paves the way for widespread implementation and adaptation to diverse ecological needs, offering hope in the fight against the global marine pollution crisis.</p>
