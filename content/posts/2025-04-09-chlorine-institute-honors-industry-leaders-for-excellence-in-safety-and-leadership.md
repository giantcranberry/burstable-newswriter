<p>The Chlorine Institute (CI) has recently honored two distinguished figures in the chlor-alkali industry, Manuel 'Manny' Correia of Kuehne Chemical Company and John Christie of ERCO Worldwide, for their outstanding contributions to the field. These awards not only celebrate individual achievements but also underscore the industry's dedication to safety, leadership, and continuous improvement.</p><p>Manuel 'Manny' Correia was awarded the Peter M. Mayo Award, a prestigious recognition established in 2005 to honor individuals who exhibit exceptional leadership and service to the chlor-alkali industry. With over two decades of experience, Correia has been a pivotal figure in advancing safety and emergency preparedness initiatives. His involvement in the Emergency Preparedness and Product Stewardship Issue Teams, along with his role as a key instructor for emergency response team training at the Mississippi State Fire Academy since 2007, showcases his unwavering commitment to industry safety.</p><p>John Christie was named an Honorary Member of the Chlorine Institute, a rare honor with only 15 individuals receiving this designation in the organization's 101-year history. Christie's 43-year tenure at ERCO Worldwide and his leadership roles within the CI, including vice chair and chair of the CI Board, have been instrumental in advancing the industry's safety and operational standards.</p><p>These recognitions by the Chlorine Institute highlight the critical role of leadership and dedication in maintaining and enhancing safety and operational excellence within the chlor-alkali industry. By honoring individuals like Correia and Christie, the CI not only acknowledges their personal achievements but also reinforces the importance of these values across the industry.
