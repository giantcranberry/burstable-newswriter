<p>Nicola Mining Inc. (TSX.V: NIM) (FSE: HLIA) (OTCQB: HUSIF) is making strategic moves to solidify its position in the mining sector, with a clear focus on generating cash flow and exploring copper growth opportunities. CEO Peter Espig recently shared these insights during an interview on the MiningNewsWire Podcast, highlighting the company's unique assets and strategic approach to growth.</p><p>At the heart of Nicola Mining's strategy is its fully permitted mill in British Columbia, the only one in the province capable of processing third-party gold and silver ore. This asset positions Nicola Mining as a central hub for smaller, high-grade mining operations that lack their own processing infrastructure. The company's Merritt-based facility has been consistently producing, and with profit-sharing agreements in place with high-grade gold projects, Nicola Mining is effectively monetizing its assets.</p><p>Espig also discussed the company's copper exploration efforts at the New Craigmont site, adjacent to the Highland Valley Copper mine, Canada's largest copper mine. This exploration underscores Nicola Mining's commitment to expanding its footprint in the copper mining sector, a critical industry given the global push towards electrification and renewable energy sources.</p><p>The company's disciplined, cash-flow-first strategy is designed to efficiently monetize high-grade gold, silver, and copper assets. With plans to scale through strategic acquisitions, Nicola Mining is positioning itself as a rare entity that combines production capabilities with exploration potential, offering long-term upside for investors.</p><p>For investors and industry observers, Nicola Mining's approach offers a glimpse into the future of mining in British Columbia. By supporting smaller mining operations and focusing on copper exploration, the company is not only contributing to the local economy but also positioning itself for sustainable growth in a sector that is increasingly vital to the global economy.</p>
