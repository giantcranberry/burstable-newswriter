<p>The Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission (PUC) has raised alarms over a sophisticated phone scam that is currently targeting utility customers across the state. Utilizing advanced phone spoofing technology, scammers are making their calls appear as if they originate from the PUC, misleading residents into believing they are engaging with an official entity. This deceptive practice has already resulted in over 70 complaints in just one day, highlighting the scam's widespread impact.</p><p>Scammers are employing a fabricated narrative where they claim a request has been made to switch the customer's energy supplier, demanding an immediate cancellation fee under the threat of service termination. The PUC has clarified that it does not engage in direct calls for payment requests, supplier switch confirmations, or service interruption threats, marking these calls as unequivocally fraudulent.</p><p>To combat this scam, the PUC recommends several precautionary measures for customers. These include not disclosing personal or financial information to unsolicited callers, hanging up on suspicious calls immediately, and verifying account details directly with their utility provider using the contact information found on their billing statement. The PUC has also taken steps to report the incident to law enforcement and is working in collaboration with utility companies across Pennsylvania to enhance public awareness about this scam.</p><p>UGI Utilities, serving more than 760,000 customers in Pennsylvania, is among the entities supporting the PUC's initiative to inform and protect residents. This incident serves as a critical reminder of the importance of skepticism and caution when receiving unexpected communications regarding utility services, emphasizing the need for continuous vigilance in the face of evolving fraudulent tactics.</p>
