<p>Q.ANT is poised to transform the high-performance computing (HPC) sector with the introduction of its photonic Native Processing Server (NPS) at ISC 2025. This innovative technology represents a significant leap forward in computing, utilizing light-based processing to enhance energy efficiency and computational capabilities for a wide range of applications, including AI and physics simulations.</p><p>The NPS is powered by Q.ANT's Light Empowered Native Arithmetic's (LENA) architecture, which achieves up to 30 times the energy efficiency of conventional computing technologies. With features such as 16-bit floating point precision and a 40–50% reduction in operations for equivalent output, the NPS eliminates the need for active cooling, offering substantial cost and energy savings.</p><p>At the core of this advancement is Q.ANT's proprietary thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) photonic chip, which facilitates high-speed optical modulation without thermal crosstalk. This innovation not only minimizes energy consumption but also enables a 100x increase in compute density per rack in data centers, alongside a 90x reduction in power consumption per application.</p><p>Bob Sorensen of Hyperion Research notes the significance of Q.ANT's approach in addressing the integration and precision challenges of photonic computing. The NPS's high accuracy in performing nonlinear and mathematical operations makes it a promising alternative to digital processors, especially in fields like AI inference and image analysis.</p><p>Q.ANT's technology is designed for easy integration with existing digital infrastructure, supporting popular frameworks such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Keras. This compatibility allows for the immediate adoption of photonic computing benefits without the need for extensive system overhauls.</p><p>Dr. Michael Förtsch, CEO of Q.ANT, highlights the potential of photonics to revolutionize HPC economics. By enabling mathematical transformations with light, Q.ANT's technology offers a path toward more efficient, scalable, and sustainable computing solutions.</p><p>The photonic NPS is ideally suited for data-heavy applications, including scientific simulations and AI model training, offering simplified AI model architectures and reduced system demands through direct computation of nonlinear functions and Fourier transforms with light.</p><p>ISC 2025 attendees will have the unique opportunity to witness Q.ANT's pioneering technology in action, marking a pivotal moment in the evolution of computing technology.</p>
