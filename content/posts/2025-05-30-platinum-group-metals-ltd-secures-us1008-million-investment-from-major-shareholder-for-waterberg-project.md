<p>Platinum Group Metals Ltd. has recently announced the successful closure of a US$1.008 million non-brokered private placement with its major shareholder, Hosken Consolidated Investments Limited (HCI). This move not only underscores the unwavering confidence of HCI in Platinum Group Metals Ltd.'s strategic direction but also marks a significant milestone in the financing of the Waterberg Project, a pivotal venture in the platinum group metals (PGM) sector.</p><p>The transaction, completed on May 29, 2025, involved the issuance of 800,000 common shares at a price of US$1.26 per share. This strategic infusion of capital has reinstated HCI's ownership stake in the company to 26%, reinforcing a robust partnership that is expected to propel the Waterberg Project forward. The funds are designated for pre-construction and engineering activities at the Waterberg site, a substantial bulk underground palladium and platinum deposit in South Africa, developed in collaboration with Implats, Mnombo, and HJM.</p><p>This financing round was executed efficiently, leveraging exemptions under MI 61-101 due to HCI's status as a related party, showcasing Platinum Group Metals Ltd.'s adeptness in capital raising and its dedication to nurturing vital stakeholder relationships. The Waterberg Project stands as a cornerstone asset in the PGM domain, with the potential to significantly influence South Africa's mining industry and the global supply of precious metals. By securing this additional funding, Platinum Group Metals Ltd. not only advances its developmental agenda but also cements its standing in the fiercely competitive mining landscape.</p><p>The implications of this investment extend beyond the immediate financial boost. It signals a vote of confidence in the PGM market's future and the strategic importance of the Waterberg Project. For industry leaders and investors, this development highlights the critical role of strategic partnerships and funding in unlocking the potential of large-scale mining projects, which are essential for meeting the global demand for precious metals.</p>
