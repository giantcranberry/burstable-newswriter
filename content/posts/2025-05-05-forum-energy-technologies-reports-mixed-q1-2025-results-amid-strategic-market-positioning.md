<p>Forum Energy Technologies, Inc. (NYSE: FET) has unveiled its first quarter 2025 financial results, presenting a complex picture of growth and challenges across its business segments. The company's Drilling and Completions segment emerged as a standout performer, with revenue climbing to $115.6 million, marking a 4.1% increase from the previous quarter. This growth was fueled by strong demand in completions equipment and subsea projects, alongside a 31% rise in segment adjusted EBITDA to $12.0 million, attributed to an improved revenue mix and higher-margin subsea activities.</p><p>Orders in the Drilling and Completions segment saw a significant 28% jump to $132.1 million, achieving a book-to-bill ratio of 1.14x, up from 0.93x in the prior quarter. This uptick underscores the company's strategic focus on investing in higher-technology, shorter-cycle equipment and consumables, positioning it to capitalize on international growth opportunities.</p><p>However, the Artificial Lift and Downhole segment faced headwinds, with revenue dropping 13.5% sequentially to $77.8 million. The decline was primarily due to delayed international project shipments and reduced demand for valve products, particularly within the Valve Solutions line. Consequently, orders fell by 21.1% to $68.6 million, and segment adjusted EBITDA decreased by approximately 30% to $14.0 million.</p><p>Despite these segment-specific challenges, Forum Energy Technologies maintained its streak of positive free cash flow before acquisitions, generating $7.2 million in Q1 2025â€”its seventh consecutive quarter of positive results. The company's disciplined approach to capital management and working capital efficiency, coupled with strategic initiatives, underscores its commitment to long-term value creation.</p><p>Looking ahead, management has reaffirmed its full-year free cash flow guidance and projects second-quarter adjusted EBITDA to range between $18.0 million and $22.0 million. This outlook is set against a backdrop of macroeconomic uncertainties, including tariff shifts and OPEC+ supply dynamics, which could influence the energy sector's trajectory.</p><p>Financial analysts at Stonegate Capital Partners have provided a valuation range for FET shares between $26.17 and $31.00, based on discounted cash flow and enterprise value/EBITDA comparative analysis. These estimates reflect confidence in the company's strategic positioning and its ability to navigate the complexities of the energy technology market.</p>
