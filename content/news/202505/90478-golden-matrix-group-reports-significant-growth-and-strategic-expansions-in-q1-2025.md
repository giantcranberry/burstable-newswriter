<p>Golden Matrix Group (NASDAQ: GMGI) has reported a remarkable first quarter in 2025, with consolidated revenue hitting $42.7 million, a 72% increase year-over-year. This growth comes despite a 4% foreign exchange headwind, underscoring the company's strong operational and financial strategies. A key highlight of the quarter was the elimination of approximately $9.6 million in Lind Global debt and the conversion of over $9.5 million in Meridianbet acquisition-related debt into equity, significantly strengthening the company's financial position.</p><p>Meridianbet, a subsidiary of Golden Matrix, has been instrumental in this growth, securing a permanent online betting license in Brazil, a market with a projected $5.6 billion gross gaming revenue. The company also expanded its B2B operations into Nigeria and renewed its online license in Serbia for another 10 years, further solidifying its global presence. These strategic moves not only enhance Meridianbet's operational footprint but also open up new revenue streams in high-growth markets.</p><p>The raffle segment of Golden Matrix saw exceptional growth, with user registrations increasing by 146% year-over-year and 26,000 new users added in the first quarter alone. Meridianbet's performance was particularly noteworthy, with first-time deposits growing by 56% and new registrations up by 22% compared to the same period in 2024. These metrics highlight the company's ability to attract and retain customers in competitive markets.</p><p>Expanse Studios, the game development arm of Meridianbet, has also made significant strides by integrating five new sweepstakes casino partnerships in North America and advancing its in-house content roadmap. With anticipated licensing expansions in Romania in the second quarter, Golden Matrix is poised for further growth in the gaming sector.</p><p>Looking ahead, Golden Matrix projects full-year 2025 revenue to be between $190 million and $195 million, representing a growth rate of 26% to 29% over 2024. CEO Brian Goodman highlighted the company's strategic positioning, emphasizing elevated operating efficiency and diversified revenue streams that continue to scale across high-growth markets. This optimistic financial outlook, coupled with ongoing investments in technology, content, and international licenses, underscores Golden Matrix's commitment to driving long-term shareholder value and its leadership in the global gaming and technology industries.</p>
