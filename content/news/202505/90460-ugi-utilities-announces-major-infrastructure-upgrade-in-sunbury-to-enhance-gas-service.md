<p>UGI Utilities is embarking on a major infrastructure upgrade in Sunbury, focusing on gas main replacement and service enhancements. The project, starting May 19, will cover several key areas including South 2nd Street, South Front Street, Slough Street, and the Weis Market's Corporate Headquarters parking lots, with completion expected by the end of June.</p><p>Construction activities are scheduled from Monday to Friday, 7 am to 5 pm, likely causing traffic delays, road closures, and temporary parking restrictions. UGI has advised drivers, residents, and business owners to prepare for these disruptions. Additionally, the company will require property access to inspect and relight equipment, ensuring safety and service continuity.</p><p>This initiative not only aims to improve the reliability and safety of the gas distribution system but also presents an opportunity for properties along the project route to switch to natural gas service. Following the underground work, final paving and restoration will be completed, with timelines subject to weather and operational conditions.</p><p>UGI Utilities, serving more than 760,000 customers, underscores its commitment to maintaining and upgrading utility infrastructure to meet the community's needs. This Sunbury project reflects the company's strategic approach to ensuring safe, reliable service while minimizing inconvenience to the public.</p>
