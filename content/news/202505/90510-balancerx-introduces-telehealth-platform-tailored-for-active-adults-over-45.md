<p>BalanceRX has introduced a telehealth platform specifically designed for active adults aged 45 and older, addressing their unique health needs with personalized care strategies. This initiative is timely, given that nearly 28% of U.S. adults over 50 are physically inactive, as per 2016 CDC data. The platform is a response to the changing dynamics of aging, especially with the increasing popularity of sports such as pickleball, where a significant portion of players are over 55.</p><p>Founder Reuben Rock highlights the platform's mission to redefine aging by offering comprehensive support for those aiming to sustain an active lifestyle. BalanceRX provides nationwide telehealth services, facilitating online consultations with licensed professionals. These consultations are aimed at creating individualized health plans that focus on energy optimization, weight management, hormonal balance, and overall vitality. The approach is holistic, tailored to each client's specific goals and levels of activity.</p><p>By leveraging digital platforms to deliver expert, personalized support, BalanceRX empowers adults to maintain their strength, confidence, and performance potential across various life stages. This service embodies a forward-thinking approach to healthcare, recognizing the shifting expectations and capabilities of the over-45 demographic.</p>
