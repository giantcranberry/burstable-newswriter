Kris Pederson, with a rich background in corporate governance at giants like EY, IBM, and PwC, is set to join the Board of Directors on May 1, 2025, taking the helm of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. This move is complemented by the appointment of Dr. Benjamin Sanchez as a Scientific Advisor in February, aimed at strengthening the company's pursuit of federal funding and clinical research collaborations.</p><p>The timing of these appointments is critical, as alcohol misuse continues to pose a severe public health threat, ranking as the fourth leading cause of preventable death in the U.S. and seventh globally.
