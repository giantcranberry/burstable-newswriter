<p>Nephros, Inc., a leader in water filtration technology for medical and commercial sectors, announced a remarkable financial performance for the first quarter of 2025. The company reported a 38% increase in net revenue, reaching $4.9 million compared to $3.5 million in the same period last year. This growth is attributed to higher reorder rates, an increase in new active sites, and strategic pre-ordering before a price adjustment in February 2025.</p><p>Robert Banks, President and CEO of Nephros, emphasized the company's record quarterly net revenue and outstanding performance across both programmatic and dialysis segments. The company also saw a notable rise in emergency business, with demand becoming more geographically diverse. However, Banks advised that such emergency activity levels might not be sustained throughout the year.</p><p>Financial highlights include an improvement in gross margin to 65% from 62% in the previous year, driven by the strategic price increase, a favorable product mix, and reduced inventory reserves. Nephros achieved a net income of $558,000, marking its second profitable quarter in history, a significant turnaround from a net loss of $169,000 in Q1 2024.</p><p>The company expanded its active sites to a record 1,600 in Q1 and enhanced its digital support app with hundreds of filter locations. Despite potential challenges from recent tariff activities, Nephros remains confident in its market position and ability to sustain strong margins.</p><p>Looking ahead, Nephros is focused on innovation, with plans for new product launches and advancements. The company aims to strengthen its core programmatic business while staying prepared for water-safety emergencies. As of March 31, 2025, Nephros boasts a robust financial standing with approximately $4.1 million in cash and cash equivalents, no debt, and a clear path for future growth.</p>
