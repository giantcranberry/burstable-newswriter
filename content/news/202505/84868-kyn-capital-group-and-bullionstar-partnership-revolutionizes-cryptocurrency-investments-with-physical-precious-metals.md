<p>The financial technology sector witnesses a significant innovation as KYN Capital Group announces the integration of a new feature in its KOINFOLD Pay 2.0 platform, enabling cryptocurrency investors to directly purchase physical precious metals. This development comes through a strategic partnership with BullionStar, a leading precious metals dealer. The service allows the conversion of digital currencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum into tangible assets like gold, silver, and platinum, measured by the gram. This integration not only bridges the gap between digital and physical assets but also provides investors with a secure and stable investment option amidst fluctuating markets.</p><p>Through BullionStar's Bullion Savings Program (BSP), investors can acquire precious metals at competitive prices, with the assurance that each gram is backed by physical metals stored in secure, fully audited vaults located in Dallas, Texas; Singapore; and Wellington, New Zealand. These facilities ensure full legal ownership of the metals to the customers, stored outside the traditional banking systems to minimize counterparty risk. The vaults are fully insured and undergo regular audits by LBMA-approved firms, including Bureau Veritas, ensuring transparency and security for investors.</p><p>Rick Wilson, CEO of KYN Capital Group, emphasized the importance of this partnership, stating that it combines the flexibility of cryptocurrency with the stability of precious metals. This innovative service offers users a practical solution to hedge against economic volatility and inflation, providing a transparent and secure method to access physical bullion. Additionally, the platform offers tax benefits, such as GST exemptions for investment-grade metals in Singapore, with similar advantages available in the United States and New Zealand. Investors have the flexibility to buy, sell, audit, or withdraw their metals 24/7 through BullionStar's platform, making it a convenient option for diversifying and stabilizing investment portfolios.</p><p>This collaboration marks a pivotal moment in digital asset management, offering cryptocurrency investors a tangible method to diversify their holdings. By enabling the direct purchase of physical precious metals with digital currencies, KYN Capital Group and BullionStar are setting a new standard for investment security and flexibility. This service not only caters to the immediate needs of investors looking for stability in volatile markets but also paves the way for future innovations in the intersection of cryptocurrency and traditional investment assets.</p>
