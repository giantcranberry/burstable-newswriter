<p>Mullen Automotive Inc. (NASDAQ: MULN) has reached a settlement agreement with GEM Yield Bahamas Limited and GEM Global Yield LLC SCS, concluding a four-year legal dispute. This agreement facilitates a structured resolution to ongoing legal issues, enabling Mullen to concentrate on its core mission of electric vehicle (EV) production. The settlement includes a 55-day due diligence period for GEM to assess the transfer of Mullen's Mishawaka assets, during which all collection activities will be paused.</p><p>Amid these legal developments, Mullen continues to enhance its manufacturing capabilities, particularly at its Tunica, Mississippi facility, which began commercial vehicle production in August 2023. This facility is pivotal in meeting the increasing demand for Mullen's EV products, including the Mullen ONE and Mullen THREE, both of which have achieved CARB and EPA certification. The Mullen THREE, in particular, is eligible for a $45,000 cash voucher under CARB's HVIP program, enhancing its market appeal.</p><p>Expanding its commercial reach, Mullen has grown its dealer network to seven, with new partnerships such as Pap√© Kenworth, ensuring comprehensive sales and service coverage across significant U.S. markets. Additionally, the Tunica facility's Foreign Trade Zone status offers strategic advantages, including duty deferment and exemptions on exported vehicles, reinforcing Mullen's competitive edge in the EV sector.</p><p>This settlement marks a critical juncture for Mullen Automotive, providing a pathway to overcome legal hurdles and bolster its position in the rapidly evolving electric vehicle industry. The company's progress in production, certification, and network expansion underscores its commitment to innovation and sustainability in transportation.</p>
