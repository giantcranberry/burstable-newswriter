<p>SolarBank Corp., a renewable energy developer, has announced a $100 million project financing agreement with infrastructure investor CIM Group. This deal is set to propel the development of 21 solar projects across the United States, with a combined capacity of 97 megawatts. The financing arrangement is structured as a preferred equity deal, allowing SolarBank to retain majority ownership of the projects while offering CIM Group a 3% annual coupon and full ownership of investment tax credits.</p><p>This strategic move enables SolarBank to expand its renewable energy portfolio without diluting its existing shareholders' equity. It represents a pivotal shift for the company from being a mere developer of solar projects to becoming a long-term owner of solar assets. The partnership with CIM Group not only underscores the increasing investor confidence in the U.S. renewable energy market but also highlights SolarBank's dedication to fostering distributed and community solar initiatives.</p><p>The 97 MW solar project portfolio is a testament to the growing demand for clean energy infrastructure in the United States. By leveraging this financing, SolarBank is poised to make a substantial contribution to the country's energy transition towards more sustainable sources. This development is a clear indicator of the renewable energy sector's potential to attract significant investment, driving forward the global agenda for a cleaner, more sustainable future.</p>
