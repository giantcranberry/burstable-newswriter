<p>The EEcosystem has unveiled a new online learning platform featuring the Transmission Lines 101 course, a free educational resource developed in partnership with Professor Dr. Eric Bogatin. This course is tailored for electronics engineers at all career stages, focusing on signal integrity principles frequently absent from conventional engineering curricula.</p><p>Comprising 25 self-paced modules, the course allows participants to cultivate crucial design intuition independently. Upon completion, engineers will receive a downloadable certificate, applicable for continuing education credits. The initiative is supported by Rohde & Schwarz and Polar Instruments, highlighting its relevance and potential impact on the engineering sector.</p><p>Dr. Bogatin, a renowned expert in high-speed digital design from the University of Colorado Boulder, crafted the curriculum to demystify complex engineering topics. Judy Warner, The EEcosystem's founder, stated the platform's goal is to connect engineers directly with industry leaders, with the Transmission Lines 101 course being the inaugural offering in a series of educational programs.</p><p>This course is accessible via The EEcosystem's website, marking a pivotal advancement in professional development resources for the electronics engineering community. By addressing a critical educational void, this initiative not only empowers engineers but also fosters innovation and excellence in the field.</p>
