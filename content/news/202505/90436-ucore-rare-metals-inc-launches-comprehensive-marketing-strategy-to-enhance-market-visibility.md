<p>Ucore Rare Metals Inc. has announced a series of investor awareness and marketing agreements aimed at expanding its strategic communications and enhancing its visibility in the market. The company has partnered with three firms to bolster its outreach across various regions, marking a significant step in its mission to become a frontrunner in the advanced technology sector for rare and critical metal resources.</p><p>The initiative includes a yearlong communications campaign with InvestorBrandNetwork, starting May 8, 2025, with a quarterly investment of $23,200. Furthermore, Ucore has secured a six-month targeted campaign in Germany with Goldinvest Consulting, beginning May 5, at a monthly cost of EUR 4,050. The most notable agreement is with Outside the Box Capital, involving a 12-month contract that features $160,000 in cash, 100,000 stock options, and a $25,000 budget for influencer marketing, subject to approval by the TSX Venture Exchange.</p><p>These efforts are part of Ucore's broader strategy to disrupt the rare-earth element (REE) supply chain in North America, currently dominated by the People's Republic of China. The company is focused on developing a heavy and light rare-earth processing facility in Louisiana, with future plans for Strategic Metal Complexes in Canada and Alaska. Additionally, Ucore is advancing its 100% controlled Bokan-Dotson Ridge Rare Heavy REE Project on Prince of Wales Island in Southeast Alaska.</p><p>This expanded marketing strategy highlights Ucore's dedication to raising investor awareness and establishing itself as an innovative leader in the extraction and separation technology of critical metals. The move is poised to have significant implications for the industry, potentially reshaping the global supply chain for rare-earth elements and reducing reliance on Chinese exports.</p>
