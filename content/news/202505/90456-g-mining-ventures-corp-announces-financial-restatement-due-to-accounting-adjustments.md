<p>G Mining Ventures Corp. (TSX: GMIN) (OTCQX: GMINF) has announced its intention to restate the 2024 consolidated financial statements and Management Discussion and Analysis. This decision comes in light of two non-cash accounting adjustments totaling approximately $32 million, related to the International Accounting Standard (IAS) 21 foreign exchange treatment. The restatement will involve reclassifying $11 million in unrealized foreign exchange losses and $21 million in income tax recovery, leading to significant revisions in the company's reported financial metrics for the fourth quarter of 2024.</p><p>The adjustments will revise the net income from $47.6 million to $15.2 million and decrease the basic earnings per share (EPS) from $0.21 to $0.07. Despite these substantial changes, G Mining Ventures Corp. has clarified that the adjustments are non-cash in nature and will not affect the company's cash position, operational performance, or financial covenants. This restatement is a reflection of accounting reclassifications rather than any substantive changes to the company's financial health.</p><p>The company is set to file the revised financial documents ahead of the release of its first-quarter 2025 results on May 14, with a conference call scheduled for May 15 to offer further details and context regarding the restatement. This move underscores the complexities inherent in international accounting standards, especially those pertaining to foreign exchange treatments, and showcases G Mining Ventures Corp.'s dedication to maintaining transparency and accuracy in its financial reporting.</p>
