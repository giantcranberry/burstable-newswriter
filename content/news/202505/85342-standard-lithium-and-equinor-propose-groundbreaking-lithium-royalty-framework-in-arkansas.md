<p>Standard Lithium Ltd., in partnership with Equinor, has taken a significant step forward in the development of the South West Arkansas Project by submitting an application to the Arkansas Oil and Gas Commission for a comprehensive lithium royalty framework. This innovative proposal includes a 2.5% gross royalty on lithium output, tied to North American index pricing, alongside additional annual brine fees that could elevate total compensation to around 3%. The details of this proposal are set to be examined during a formal hearing on May 28, 2025, in Magnolia, Arkansas.</p><p>This initiative is a key component of the Smackover Formation project, which aims to bolster sustainable lithium production capabilities. By establishing a structured compensation model for landowners, the joint venture not only seeks to foster regional economic growth but also to pave the way for responsible resource extraction. Standard Lithium, a near-commercial lithium development company, is focusing on leveraging high-grade lithium-brine properties in the U.S., emphasizing projects with strong infrastructure, skilled labor, and efficient permitting processes.</p><p>The proposed royalty framework could serve as a benchmark for future lithium extraction endeavors in the area, underscoring lithium's critical role in renewable energy and advanced technology sectors. Through this transparent and equitable compensation model, Standard Lithium and Equinor are aiming to create a win-win scenario for all parties involved in the burgeoning lithium economy, highlighting the strategic importance of sustainable resource management and economic development in the transition to greener energy solutions.</p>
