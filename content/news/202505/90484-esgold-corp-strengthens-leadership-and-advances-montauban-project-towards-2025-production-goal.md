<p>ESGold Corp., a pre-production gold and silver company, has taken significant steps to advance its Montauban Project in Quebec, marking a pivotal moment in its journey towards becoming a producer. The company announced the appointment of Peter Espig to its board of directors, a move that brings invaluable expertise in project finance and the transition of junior mining companies into production. Espig's appointment is complemented by the issuance of 500,000 restricted share units (RSUs), reflecting ESGold's strategy to align its leadership's interests with the company's long-term success.</p><p>Construction at the Montauban processing site is progressing as planned, with the imminent delivery of Humphrey Spirals, a critical component for the gravity recovery circuit. These spirals are essential for the efficient extraction of minerals, underscoring the project's technical advancements. The Montauban property, strategically located 80 kilometers west of Quebec City, is not only a testament to ESGold's near-term production ambitions but also highlights the potential for district-scale exploration.</p><p>ESGold's focus on achieving production by the end of 2025 is a clear indicator of its commitment to contributing to the mining sector's future. The company's emphasis on responsible mining practices, through sustainable resource recovery and the integration of innovative technologies, positions it as a forward-thinking player in the clean mining and exploration landscape. This development is significant for investors and industry observers, as it demonstrates ESGold's ability to meet its milestones while adhering to environmental and sustainability standards.</p>
