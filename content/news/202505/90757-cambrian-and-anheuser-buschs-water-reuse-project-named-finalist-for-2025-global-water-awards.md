<p>The collaborative water reuse initiative between Cambrian and Anheuser-Busch, implemented at Anheuser-Busch's Houston brewery, has been named a finalist for the 2025 Global Water Awards' Industrial Project of the Year. This recognition underscores the project's innovative approach to addressing industrial water sustainability through a unique Water-Energy Purchase Agreement (WEPA) model. The model facilitates large-scale water reuse without the need for upfront capital investment, marking a significant advancement in sustainable industrial practices.</p><p>Cambrian's role in designing, financing, and operating a modular treatment system capable of processing up to 400,000 gallons of high-strength wastewater daily is at the heart of this project. Over a 20-year contract, the system is projected to treat 3.45 billion gallons of wastewater, offering both environmental and economic benefits. The use of advanced treatment technologies is expected to reduce water and wastewater costs by 20% and avoid more than 23,000 tons of carbon dioxide emissions. Annually, the project will eliminate approximately 1,230 metric tons of CO₂ emissions, an impact equivalent to removing over 260 cars from the road.</p><p>The partnership between Cambrian and Anheuser-Busch, initiated in 2019 through the 100+ Accelerator, a global sustainability innovation platform, has culminated in the deployment of Cambrian's BlueCycle™ membrane bioreactor technology. Matthew Silver, Cambrian's CEO and Founder, highlighted the project's innovative combination of advanced treatment with a performance-based business model. Angie Slaughter, Vice President of Sustainability Procurement at Anheuser-Busch, emphasized the critical role of partnerships in scaling sustainable solutions.</p><p>The Global Water Awards, presented by Global Water Intelligence, aim to recognize outstanding achievements in the international water industry. The Industrial Project of the Year category specifically acknowledges projects that make significant contributions to water sustainability in the industrial sector. This nomination not only celebrates the achievements of Cambrian and Anheuser-Busch but also sets a benchmark for future industrial water reuse projects worldwide.</p>
