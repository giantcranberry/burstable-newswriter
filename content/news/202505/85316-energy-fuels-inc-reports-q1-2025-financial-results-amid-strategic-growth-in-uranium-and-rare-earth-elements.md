<p>Energy Fuels Inc., a leading U.S. critical minerals company, reported a net loss of $26.3 million for the first quarter of 2025, against revenues of $16.9 million. This financial outcome reflects the company's strategic inventory management and costs associated with operational expansion. Despite the loss, Energy Fuels has optimistically increased its uranium production forecast for 2025 to up to 1 million pounds, signaling confidence in its operational capabilities and market demand.</p><p>The company's Pinyon Plain mine has shown promising geological grades, which are expected to bolster future production levels. With an expanded uranium inventory of 1.3 million pounds of U₃O₈, Energy Fuels is well-positioned to meet growing market needs. This inventory growth, coupled with strategic partnerships with Chemours and POSCO, underscores the company's commitment to enhancing the domestic supply chain for rare earth elements and uranium, critical components in clean energy technologies.</p><p>Financially, Energy Fuels maintains a strong position, ending the quarter with over $210 million in working capital and no debt. This robust financial health affords the company considerable flexibility to pursue further investments and operational expansions. The White Mesa Mill in Utah, the only fully licensed conventional uranium processing facility in the U.S., plays a central role in Energy Fuels' diversified strategy, capable of producing uranium, rare earth products, and vanadium oxide.</p><p>Internationally, Energy Fuels is advancing its portfolio with projects in Kenya, Madagascar, Brazil, and Australia, including a joint venture with Astron Corporation Limited that could see the company acquiring up to a 49% interest in developing mineral ventures. As the global appetite for clean energy and critical minerals escalates, Energy Fuels' strategic initiatives in uranium production and rare earth elements position it as a key player in the transition to a more sustainable energy future.</p>
