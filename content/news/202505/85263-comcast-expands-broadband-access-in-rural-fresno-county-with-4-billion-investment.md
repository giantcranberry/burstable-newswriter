<p>Comcast is set to transform the digital landscape of rural Fresno County with a significant expansion of its broadband network, targeting more than 160 previously unserved locations in Riverdale. This ambitious project, expected to be completed by 2026, is part of Comcast's broader $4 billion technology investment across California. The initiative is bolstered by a $1 million Federal Funding Account grant from the California Public Utilities Commission, alongside Comcast's private funding, marking a pivotal step towards enhancing digital connectivity in underserved areas.</p><p>Beyond the infrastructural advancements, Comcast has taken a holistic approach to support the local community. The company has donated laptop computers to all eighth-grade students in Caruthers and contributed $10,000 to the Caruthers Unified Education Fund. These efforts underscore Comcast's commitment to not only improving internet access but also fostering digital literacy and opportunities for students, individuals, and families in the region.</p><p>The significance of Comcast's investment has been widely recognized by local leaders. Caruthers Unified School District Superintendent Orin Hirschkorn commended the company for addressing both technological and educational needs. Fresno County Supervisor Buddy Mendes highlighted the potential economic benefits, suggesting that the project could spur economic growth, support local businesses, and enhance the overall quality of life for residents.</p><p>The new network promises to deliver multi-gigabit internet speeds with 99.9 percent reliability, offering residents access to Xfinity's comprehensive services, including internet, video, mobile, and home security. Additionally, through its Internet Essentials program, Comcast has already connected more than 2.2 million Californians to affordable high-speed internet, further demonstrating its commitment to closing the digital divide.</p><p>Comcast's investment in California extends beyond infrastructure, with over $130.5 million in cash and in-kind donations to nonprofits focused on digital skills development and connectivity programs over the past three years. This expansion in Fresno County not only represents a significant leap forward in bridging the digital divide but also sets a precedent for how private and public sectors can collaborate to foster community development and economic growth.</p>
