<p>UGI Utilities is embarking on a significant gas main replacement project in Bethlehem, starting May 19, with completion anticipated by early July. This initiative will impact several major streets, including East Third Street, South New Street, Columbia Street, and Adams Street, with construction activities scheduled from 7 am to 5 pm, Monday through Friday.</p><p>The project is expected to bring about road closures, detours, and traffic delays, alongside temporary interruptions in natural gas service as UGI representatives access properties for equipment inspection and relighting. The construction zones are specifically located between East Third Street and Webster Street, South New Street and Mechanic Street, Columbia Street and Adams Street, and Adams Street and East Third Street.</p><p>Weather and working conditions may influence the project's timeline, with final paving and site restoration to follow the underground work. This upgrade underscores UGI Utilities' dedication to ensuring the safety and reliability of its services. Additionally, properties along the construction route may have the chance to convert to natural gas, presenting an opportunity for enhanced energy solutions for residents and businesses in the area.</p><p>This infrastructure improvement is a critical step in modernizing Bethlehem's utility systems, potentially leading to more efficient energy use and reduced environmental impact. For local businesses and residents, the project not only signifies a temporary inconvenience but also the prospect of long-term benefits through upgraded services and the possibility of switching to natural gas.</p>
