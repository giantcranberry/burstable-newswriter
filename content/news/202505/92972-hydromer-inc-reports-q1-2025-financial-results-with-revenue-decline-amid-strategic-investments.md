The company's preliminary unaudited financial results showed quarterly revenue of $1.0 million, down from $1.1 million in Q1 2024. Net income also saw a significant decrease, falling 64% to $112,000. CEO Michael Torti pointed to legacy customer attrition and the typical onboarding delays in the medical coatings sector as primary reasons for the downturn.</p><p>Despite these financial setbacks, Hydromer is not deterred from its strategic path. The company has continued to invest in product development and commercial infrastructure, aiming to enhance its product pipeline and penetrate higher-value markets.
