The initiative underscores the evolving landscape of college athletics, where student-athletes can now benefit from their personal brands.</p><p>TheLinkU will offer a comprehensive suite of services to Troy University's student-athletes, including national brand partnerships, revenue sharing modeling software, and a NIL marketplace.

Additionally, the partnership includes financial seminars and access to wealth advisors, ensuring that student-athletes are well-equipped to manage their earnings responsibly.</p><p>Austin Elrod, founder and president of TheLinkU, brings a unique perspective to the partnership as a former student-athlete himself.
