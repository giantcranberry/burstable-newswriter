<p>The PACE Organization of Rhode Island (PACE-RI) has taken a significant step forward in elder care by implementing CareHub, an electronic medical record (EMR) and practice management system developed by IntusCare. This system is specifically designed for value-based elder care models, showcasing a technological leap for PACE organizations across the nation.</p><p>IntusCare's approach to implementing CareHub was thorough, involving in-person workflow discovery sessions, operational alignment meetings, and a comprehensive four-day training bootcamp across multiple PACE-RI centers. This meticulous process ensured a seamless integration of the system into PACE-RI's operations.</p><p>Joan Kwiatkowski, PACE-RI's Chief Executive Officer, emphasized that CareHub was developed with the unique needs of PACE programs in mind. This tailored design is expected to bring about significant operational improvements, including better interdisciplinary team coordination, reduced time spent on documentation, and enhanced visibility across clinical and administrative workflows.</p><p>Liz Boucher, Chief of Organizational Performance at PACE-RI, pointed out the system's potential to not only create a more efficient work environment but also to improve the quality of care provided to participants. The involvement of PACE-RI in the CareHub Product Steering Committee allowed for direct input from frontline staff and leadership into the system's development, ensuring the inclusion of innovative tools for interdisciplinary tasking, care planning, and compliance support.</p><p>Robbie Felton, CEO of IntusCare, described the implementation as the beginning of a new era in how technology supports participant care. This collaboration between PACE-RI and IntusCare represents a milestone in the use of technology to enhance elder care services.</p><p>PACE programs, serving 80,000 participants across 33 states, are federally designated to provide comprehensive medical and social services to nursing home-eligible adults who choose to stay in their communities. PACE-RI's implementation of CareHub is a testament to the organization's commitment to leveraging technology for the betterment of elder care, serving the entire state of Rhode Island through its centers in East Providence, Newport, Westerly, and Woonsocket.</p>
