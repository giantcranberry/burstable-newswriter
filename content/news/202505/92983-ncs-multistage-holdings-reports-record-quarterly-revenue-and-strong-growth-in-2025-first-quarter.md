<p>NCS Multistage Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: NCSM) has unveiled its first-quarter financial results for 2025, showcasing a significant 14% year-over-year revenue increase to $50.0 million. This achievement marks the company's highest quarterly revenue since the beginning of 2020, underscoring a period of robust growth and financial recovery. The revenue surge was largely attributed to heightened product sales in Canada and increased service revenues across various global markets, with the Canadian market showing particular strength in fracturing system completions.</p><p>Internationally, the company benefited from ongoing tracer diagnostics projects in the Middle East and product and service sales in the North Sea, contributing to a 33.8% year-over-year increase in international revenues to $2.9 million. Despite a sequential decline of 34% due to the timing of tracer service work, the company's leadership remains optimistic about pursuing high-margin opportunities in these regions.</p><p>Financially, NCS Multistage Holdings reported a gross profit of $21.9 million, with gross margins expanding from 40.1% in Q1 2024 to 43.7% in Q1 2025. The company's earnings per share (EPS) also saw a remarkable improvement, jumping to $1.58 from $0.83 in the same quarter the previous year. Additionally, the company's balance sheet reflects a stronger liquidity position, with net working capital increasing to $64.4 million and cash and undrawn revolver totaling $49.8 million, up from $34.4 million in Q1 2024.</p><p>Looking ahead, NCS Multistage Holdings has provided optimistic full-year guidance, projecting revenues between $167.0 million and $175.0 million, with adjusted EBITDA expected to range from $20.0 million to $24.0 million. Valuation analyses suggest a target price range between $32.17 and $38.36, indicating confidence in the company's continued growth trajectory and financial stability.</p>
