<p>Soulpower Acquisition Corporation has announced that starting May 23, 2025, investors who bought units in its initial public offering will have the option to trade the company's Class A ordinary shares and rights separately on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). This move is set to provide investors with greater flexibility in managing their investment components independently, a strategy often employed by special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs) like Soulpower.</p><p>The separated securities will be identified by two distinct ticker symbols: 'SOUL' for Class A ordinary shares and 'SOULR' for the rights. Meanwhile, units that are not separated will continue to be traded under the symbol 'SOULU'. Soulpower, a SPAC incorporated in the Cayman Islands, is primarily focused on exploring business combinations within the insurance services, retirement savings, and related financial services sectors. The company's objective is to finalize a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, or a similar transaction with one or more businesses.</p><p>This development is significant for the investment community as it underscores the evolving nature of SPACs and their strategies to attract and retain investors by offering more strategic options during the search for a suitable business combination. However, potential investors are advised to consider the company's forward-looking statements, which are subject to various conditions and risks outlined in its SEC registration documents. It's important to note that there are no guarantees regarding the completion of the initial public offering or the eventual business combination.</p>
