<p>SOBRsafe Inc. (NASDAQ: SOBR) has announced its first-quarter financial results for 2025, revealing an 80.5% year-over-year revenue increase to $86,600, alongside a gross margin improvement to 58.8%. This financial upturn is largely attributed to the company's software subscription revenue, which now accounts for 53.8% of total revenue and has more than doubled compared to the previous year. The deployment of 148 SOBRsureâ„¢ devices, marking a 41% increase from the last quarter, further underscores the company's growth trajectory.</p><p>Operational efficiency has seen notable improvement, with the net loss narrowing to $1.9 million from $2.5 million in the same period last year. The quarter concluded with $10.1 million in cash, supported by $3.3 million from warrant exercises related to its October 2024 PIPE financing. These financial indicators not only reflect SOBRsafe's robust business model but also its strategic positioning in the market.</p><p>At the heart of SOBRsafe's mission is its innovative transdermal alcohol detection technology, which offers a non-invasive, instantaneous method of detecting alcohol through skin contact. This technology is pivotal in addressing alcohol misuse, the fourth leading cause of preventable death in the United States and seventh worldwide. SOBRsafe's product lineup, including SOBRcheck for point-of-care screening and SOBRsure for continuous monitoring, positions the company as a potential leader in alcohol detection and prevention technologies across various sectors.</p><p>The implications of SOBRsafe's advancements extend beyond financial success. By providing efficient and non-invasive alcohol detection solutions, the company is set to make significant contributions to public health and safety. Its technology has the potential to revolutionize alcohol monitoring in behavioral health, judicial, and consumer markets, offering a safer, more reliable alternative to traditional methods. As SOBRsafe continues to innovate and expand its reach, its impact on reducing alcohol-related harm and saving lives could be profound.</p>
