<p>ARC Clean Technology Inc. and Nucleon Energy Inc. have announced a strategic partnership to assess the feasibility of deploying the ARC-100 advanced small modular reactor (aSMR) in Alberta, Canada, and Texas. This Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) signifies a major milestone in ARC's strategy to commercialize its technology across North America, focusing initially on integrating the ARC-100 into Nucleon's power generation projects and advancing regulatory approvals in both countries.</p><p>The ARC-100, a 100-megawatt Generation IV sodium-cooled fast reactor, is designed to deliver flexible, low-carbon energy solutions, particularly for industrial sectors like oil and gas, refining, chemicals, and manufacturing. This technology is poised to play a critical role in decarbonization efforts, offering a sustainable alternative to traditional energy sources.</p><p>Robert Braun, Chief Operating Officer of ARC Clean Technology, underscored the partnership's strategic importance, aiming to pinpoint ideal locations where the ARC-100 can bolster industrial operations and ensure stable grid power. Dustin Wilkes, President and CEO of Nucleon Energy, pointed out the significance of small modular reactors in creating clean, dispatchable energy systems that tackle power reliability and emissions reduction.</p><p>Currently, the ARC-100 is under development with New Brunswick Power at the Point Lepreau site, with a License to Prepare Site application submitted to the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission in 2023 for a commercial demonstration. This MOU lays the groundwork for a potential long-term commercial alliance, with the prospect of deploying several ARC-100 units throughout North America, advancing clean energy infrastructure and industrial decarbonization.</p>
