<p>The third annual RALLY conference is set to make history by hosting the world's first vibe coding competition, a novel event that pits developers against each other to showcase their artificial intelligence coding prowess. Scheduled for September 24-25 in Indianapolis, Indiana, this competition will see twelve teams, each comprising up to three participants, vying for a $10,000 cash prize. The event, organized in partnership with Crafted, kicks off at 12:00 p.m. EST on September 24, when participants will be briefed on their coding challenge. Teams will then have the night to devise innovative solutions, with the possibility of unexpected twists adding complexity to their tasks.</p><p>This competition is a reflection of the evolving landscape of software development, where generative AI is playing an increasingly pivotal role. According to recent data from Y Combinator, about a quarter of current startup cohorts have generated nearly 95% of their codebases using AI technologies. Christopher Day, CEO of Elevate Ventures and a RALLY Visionary, highlighted the competition's importance, noting it encourages participants to harness AI and large language models creatively to foster rapid innovation.</p><p>Submissions will be judged by a panel, with the top three finalists presenting their projects on the Main Stage. The winner will not only gain recognition but also take home the $10,000 prize. RALLY's initiative underscores its role as a cross-sector innovation platform, uniting entrepreneurs, investors, policymakers, and educators across various industries, including software, agriculture and food, healthcare, sports, hardtech, and entrepreneurship.</p><p>Developers interested in participating in this pioneering event can apply between April 22, 2025, and May 22, 2025. This competition represents a significant opportunity for developers to demonstrate the transformative potential of AI in coding and software development, marking a milestone in the intersection of technology and creativity.</p>
