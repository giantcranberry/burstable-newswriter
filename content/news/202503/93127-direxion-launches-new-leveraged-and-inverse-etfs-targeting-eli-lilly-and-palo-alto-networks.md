<p>Direxion has expanded its portfolio with the introduction of four new single stock leveraged and inverse exchange-traded funds (ETFs), focusing on Eli Lilly and Company and Palo Alto Networks. This move is aimed at providing active traders with sophisticated tools to leverage momentum or hedge against volatility in these two leading stocks. The new ETFs include the Direxion Daily LLY Bull 2X Shares (ELIL), Direxion Daily LLY Bear 1X Shares (ELIS), Direxion Daily PANW Bull 2X Shares (PALU), and Direxion Daily PANW Bear 1X Shares (PALD).</p><p>Douglas Yones, CEO of Direxion, highlighted the strategic importance of these products, noting their appeal to traders with a high-risk tolerance and a deep understanding of leveraged investment strategies. Unlike traditional index-based ETFs, these funds track the performance of individual stocks, offering no diversification benefits and requiring active management due to their short-term trading nature.</p><p>The launch of these ETFs opens up new opportunities in the pharmaceutical and cybersecurity sectors. Eli Lilly is renowned for its healthcare innovations, while Palo Alto Networks is a leader in cybersecurity technology. However, Direxion warns that these leveraged and inverse ETFs are complex instruments with significant risks, including the potential for substantial value changes within short periods.</p><p>Investors are encouraged to thoroughly review the prospectus and understand the risks and rewards associated with these ETFs. Direxion also recommends utilizing their <a href='https://www.direxion.com/leveraged-etf-education' rel='nofollow' target='_blank'>Leveraged and Inverse ETF Education Center</a> for a deeper understanding of these investment tools. With approximately $47.0 billion in assets under management, Direxion continues to innovate in the ETF space, offering precise market perspectives for traders.</p>
