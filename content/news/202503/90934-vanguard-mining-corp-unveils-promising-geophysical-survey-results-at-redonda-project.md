<p>Vanguard Mining Corp. has recently disclosed the findings from an extensive airborne geophysical survey conducted over its Redonda Copper-Molybdenum Project in British Columbia's Vancouver Mining Division. This survey, encompassing 637 line kilometers, was executed by Precision GeoSurveys and has unveiled critical geological insights that could herald a new era of mineral exploration in the region.</p><p>The data collected points to magnetic trends and potassium alteration zones, which are often indicative of mineralization. With 90% of the 2,746.46-hectare property yet to be explored, the project stands on the cusp of potentially groundbreaking discoveries. Previous drilling efforts have already yielded encouraging results, such as a 142.6-meter interval showing 0.279% copper and 0.0281% molybdenum, setting a promising precedent for future endeavors.</p><p>Highlighting the survey's significance, Vanguard has pinpointed several high-priority targets for subsequent drilling, especially in zones exhibiting distinct potassic alteration and magnetic features. The company has proactively obtained permits for up to 10 drill sites along a 5.3-kilometer stretch within these high-priority areas, leveraging the survey's findings to guide its exploration strategy.</p><p>The technological prowess behind the survey cannot be overstated, with an Airbus AS350 helicopter equipped with cutting-edge data acquisition and magnetic gradient measurement tools playing a pivotal role. The project's geological context, reminiscent of other notable copper-molybdenum deposits like the OKover and Gambier Copper deposits, further amplifies its potential. Preliminary metallurgical tests have already demonstrated high recovery rates for both copper and molybdenum, underscoring the project's viability.</p><p>Amidst copper prices hovering around $5.00 per pound and gold exceeding $3,000 per ounce, the Redonda project emerges as a potentially strategic asset. Vanguard's intention to spin out the project into Blackstone Copper Corp. reflects its confidence in the project's value and prospects. The comprehensive dataset from the survey, including magnetic intensity and radiometric measurements, lays a solid groundwork for future exploration, with particular emphasis on quartz diorite porphyry units and potassic alteration zones as hotspots for potential mineralization.</p>
