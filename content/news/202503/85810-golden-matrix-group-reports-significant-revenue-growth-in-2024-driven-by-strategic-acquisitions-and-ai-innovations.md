<p>Golden Matrix Group Inc. (NASDAQ: GMGI) has announced a substantial financial upturn for the year 2024, with full-year revenues reaching $151 million, marking a 63% increase from the previous year. The fourth quarter stood out with an 81% surge in revenues to $46 million, underscoring the company's robust performance. CEO Brian Goodman attributed this growth to strategic acquisitions, including Meridianbet and Classics for a Cause, and the integration of AI-powered enhancements to their gaming platforms, which have solidified Golden Matrix's position in the competitive online gaming sector.</p><p>Operational highlights reveal Meridianbet's 14% growth in full-year revenues, with online revenue climbing 18% to $80 million. The company's B2B gaming platform, GMAG, experienced an 84% increase in wagering volume to $4.7 billion, fueled by innovative AI engagement tools. Despite these gains, Golden Matrix reported a net loss of $1.5 million for the year, largely due to acquisition-related expenses, stock-based compensation, and restructuring costs. However, the Adjusted EBITDA saw a 4% rise to $22.2 million when these factors were adjusted for.</p><p>Looking ahead, Golden Matrix is optimistic about its growth trajectory in 2025, projecting first-quarter revenues between $42 million and $45 million, which could represent a year-over-year increase of 69% to 80%. The company's strategy focuses on penetrating new regulated markets, advancing AI-driven gaming innovations, and exploring strategic acquisitions to bolster market share. Subsidiaries such as RKings Competitions, Classics for a Cause, MexPlay, and Expanse Studios have all shown impressive growth, with Expanse Studios expanding its game portfolio to 55 proprietary titles and achieving a 174% revenue growth in 2024.</p><p>With a solid cash reserve of $30 million and a clear strategic direction, Golden Matrix Group is well-equipped to sustain its growth momentum in the ever-evolving online gaming industry. This performance not only highlights the company's resilience and adaptability but also underscores the potential of strategic acquisitions and technological innovations in driving business success.</p>
