<p>As data privacy and national security concerns grow, Brand Engagement Network (BEN) is at the forefront of developing secure artificial intelligence technology designed to shield user information from potential foreign threats. The company's innovative AI platform functions within a closed-loop system, a method that ensures sensitive business and consumer data is safeguarded against unauthorized access. This approach starkly contrasts with many AI platforms that rely on public or unspecified data sources for training, as BEN's technology strictly utilizes client-provided information, thereby maintaining rigorous control over data usage.</p><p>In a significant move towards enhancing data privacy, Republican Assembly member Carl DeMaio is working alongside BEN to draft legislation. This proposed rule would mandate technology platforms to reveal their foreign data storage practices and secure explicit user consent. It would also ban businesses from storing sensitive healthcare, financial, or geolocation data under the custody of foreign governments. This initiative gains importance against the backdrop of increasing governmental scrutiny over China-based technology platforms, with the U.S. government contemplating bans on platforms like DeepSeek AI from government devices due to national security concerns.</p><p>Paul Chang, BEN's CEO, has highlighted the company's dedication to creating safe technology that leverages AI's benefits without compromising data security. The platform's design adheres to HIPAA and SOC 2 compliance standards, offering an extra security layer for sensitive information. BEN's AI technology stands out by operating efficiently on central processing units (CPUs) rather than the more energy-demanding graphics processing units (GPUs), presenting a scalable and accessible solution for businesses. This efficiency is demonstrated in BEN's recent partnership with Valio Technologies Pty Ltd., aimed at developing healthcare AI assistants for over 315,000 students in South African universities, with a firm commitment to keeping data within secure environments.</p><p>With the increasing emphasis on data privacy by businesses and policymakers alike, BEN's closed-loop AI model emerges as a viable solution for protecting user information while harnessing the power of advanced technology. This development not only addresses immediate security concerns but also sets a precedent for future AI applications in sensitive sectors.</p>
