<p>UGI Utilities, Inc. is set to start a major gas main replacement project in Allentown on March 12, with the initiative expected to continue until mid-July. This project targets several key streets within the city, including West Whitehall Street, North Emery Street, North Fair Street, North College Street, North Mohr Street, and North 4th Street, aiming to significantly upgrade the local infrastructure.</p><p>The construction, scheduled from Monday to Friday between 7 am and 5 pm, may lead to disruptions such as traffic delays, parking restrictions, and temporary interruptions in natural gas service. However, it also presents a unique opportunity for residents and business owners along the project route to consider converting to natural gas service, thanks to the strategic replacement of gas mains facilitating such transitions.</p><p>UGI Utilities has noted that the project's timeline could be affected by weather and working conditions. Property owners should be prepared for service access requirements, as UGI technicians will need to inspect and relight equipment as part of the upgrade process. This initiative underscores UGI's commitment to ensuring the safety and reliability of utility infrastructure, with the added benefit of potentially expanding energy options for the Allentown community.</p><p>Local stakeholders, including drivers, residents, and business owners, are advised to anticipate possible road closures, detours, and traffic delays during the construction period. Parking will be restricted on the affected streets during working hours, emphasizing the need for planning and patience as the city undergoes these essential infrastructure improvements.</p>
