The company's consolidated gross margins increased to 77.4%, up from 66.2% in the previous quarter, with quarterly revenue reaching $30.4 million. This growth is attributed to the Imagery and Software Analytics segment, which generated $17.5 million, and the Professional and Engineering segment, contributing $12.9 million.</p><p>A highlight of the quarter was the successful launch of BlackSky's first Gen-3 satellite, which has already exceeded customer expectations with its imagery quality. The company plans to launch seven more satellites within the next year, enhancing its high-frequency monitoring and very high-resolution imaging capabilities to 35cm. These advancements underscore BlackSky's commitment to leading in the satellite technology space.</p><p>BlackSky's contract awards have significantly expanded its backlog from $261 million to approximately $390 million, with some contracts extending up to seven years. This expansion not only demonstrates the company's ability to secure long-term, premium contracts but also aligns with its strategy to meet evolving customer needs. Financially, BlackSky is in a strong position, ending the quarter with $53.8 million in liquidity and expecting an additional $27.9 million over the next 12 months from milestone achievements.</p><p>Looking ahead to fiscal year 2025, BlackSky has provided revenue guidance between $125.0 million and $142.0 million, with an adjusted EBITDA range of $14.0 million to $22.0 million.
