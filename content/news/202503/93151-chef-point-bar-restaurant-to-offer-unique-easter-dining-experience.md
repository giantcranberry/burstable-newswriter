<p>Chef Point Bar & Restaurant in Colleyville, Texas, is preparing to offer a unique Easter dining experience on Sunday, April 20. The restaurant will serve an Ã  la carte menu that includes a variety of carefully prepared dishes, such as a Smoked Ribeye Steak with truffle mashed potatoes, an Easter Turkey Dinner with traditional sides, and a Blackened Stuffed Chicken filled with aged pepper jack cheese and crab meat. Additional highlights feature Oxtail in Spicy African Red Sauce, Dill Crusted Branzino, and a classic Monte Cristo sandwich.</p><p>Executive Chef and Owner Franson Nwaeze highlighted the restaurant's dedication to creating meaningful dining experiences that unite people, rather than just serving food. This philosophy is reflected in the restaurant's evolution from a modest kitchen inside a Conoco gas station to a nationally acclaimed dining venue in the Dallas-Fort Worth area.</p><p>The Easter menu will also boast signature desserts, including the renowned Bread Pudding with house-made hot cognac sauce and a decadent Chocolate Mousse, along with a special children's menu offering kid-friendly choices. Chef Point's remarkable journey and culinary excellence have earned it features on major media outlets like Food Network, CNBC, and NPR.</p><p>Due to limited seating, reservations are required for those wishing to partake in this exclusive Easter dining experience. The event will take place from 11 AM to 8 PM at the restaurant's location at 5220 State Hwy 121 in Colleyville, Texas.</p>
