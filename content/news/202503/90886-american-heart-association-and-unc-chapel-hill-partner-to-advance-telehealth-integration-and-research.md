<p>The American Heart Association and the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill have joined forces in a significant partnership aimed at advancing telehealth integration and research. This collaboration is set against the backdrop of a rapidly evolving virtual healthcare landscape, where recent data shows telehealth now accounts for 23% of healthcare encounters, with certain specialties seeing virtual visit rates over 50%.</p><p>At the heart of this partnership is the goal to foster innovative research, develop evidence-based frameworks, and create educational resources that will propel telehealth forward. The American Heart Association Center for Telehealth and the UNC-Chapel Hill Center for Virtual Care Value and Excellence (ViVE) are pooling their expertise to tackle existing barriers and leverage emerging technologies, including artificial intelligence, to enhance healthcare quality and outcomes.</p><p>Dr. Saif Khairat, director of the UNC ViVE Center, highlighted the transformative potential of this collaboration, aiming to elevate virtual care from a pandemic-induced necessity to a refined, integrated component of healthcare delivery. The partnership's strategic initiatives encompass evidence-based research, resource development, professional education, and the dissemination of scientific knowledge.</p><p>Key goals include the creation of comprehensive guides for integrated telehealth care models, the enhancement of professional knowledge through specialized educational resources, and the expansion of scientific networking opportunities. By uniting their distinct strengths, the American Heart Association and UNC-Chapel Hill are poised to narrow the divide between scientific advancements and their practical application in healthcare settings.</p><p>This initiative underscores the escalating role of telehealth in contemporary healthcare, particularly in mitigating access issues for patients across urban and rural areas. As the domain of virtual care continues to grow, this partnership marks a pivotal effort in ensuring the delivery of high-quality, innovative, and patient-focused digital health solutions.</p>
