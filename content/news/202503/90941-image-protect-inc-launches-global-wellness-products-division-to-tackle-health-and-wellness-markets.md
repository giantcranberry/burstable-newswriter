<p>Image Protect, Inc. has announced the creation of Global Wellness Products, a new division dedicated to health and wellness technologies, marking a significant expansion of its business portfolio. This move includes an exclusive marketing and distribution agreement with Therma Bright, Inc., a Canadian medical device developer, to introduce two groundbreaking products to the market: the InterceptCS™ Cold Sore Prevention Device and the Benepod™ light therapy pain relief device.</p><p>The global cold sore treatment market, valued at $1.02 billion in 2024, is expected to grow to $1.57 billion by 2031, according to Coherent Research. This growth presents a lucrative opportunity for Global Wellness Products, especially with the InterceptCS™ device targeting over 5 million chronic cold sore sufferers in the United States alone.

Rob Fia, President of Therma Bright, also shared his optimism about the partnership, pointing to Global Wellness Products' expertise in direct-to-consumer marketing and retail partnerships as key drivers for expanding market reach.</p><p>With over 50 years of combined experience in direct response consumer sales, the management team at Global Wellness Products is confident in the division's potential to become Image Protect's highest-grossing division. Plans are already underway to introduce additional products by the summer of 2025, further solidifying the company's presence in the health and wellness sector.</p><p>This strategic expansion underscores Image Protect's commitment to diversifying its business and entering high-growth markets within healthcare technology. By focusing on clinically proven, innovative products that address specific health challenges, the company is poised to make a significant impact in the rapidly evolving wellness industry.</p>
