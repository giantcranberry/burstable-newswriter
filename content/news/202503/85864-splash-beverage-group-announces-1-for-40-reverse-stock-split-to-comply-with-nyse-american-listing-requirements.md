<p>Splash Beverage Group, Inc. (NYSE American: SBEV) has announced a significant financial restructuring through a 1-for-40 reverse stock split of its common stock, effective March 27, 2025. This strategic decision, authorized by the company's Board of Directors, is aimed at ensuring compliance with the NYSE American's listing requirements. The reverse stock split will consolidate every 40 existing shares into one new share, reducing the total number of outstanding common shares from 61,711,017 to approximately 1,542,776 and the authorized shares from 300 million to 7.5 million.</p><p>The company's stock will continue to trade under the ticker symbol SBEV but will be assigned a new CUSIP number. Shareholders who hold their shares in book-entry form or through a broker will not be required to take any action as a result of the reverse stock split. Additionally, any fractional shares resulting from the consolidation will be rounded up to the nearest whole share, ensuring fairness to all shareholders.</p><p>This reverse stock split will also have a proportional impact on the company's outstanding warrants and stock options. Specifically, each publicly traded warrant (SBEV-WT) will become exercisable into 1/40th of a share, with the exercise price adjusted to $184.00. This adjustment is part of the company's broader strategy to maintain its listing on the NYSE American and potentially improve the market perception of its stock.</p><p>Splash Beverage Group, known for its popular brands such as Copa di Vino, SALT tequila, Chispo tequila, and Pulpoloco sangria, views this reverse stock split as a strategic move to enhance its market positioning. By complying with NYSE American listing requirements and potentially making its stock more attractive to investors, the company is taking steps to strengthen its financial foundation and support future growth initiatives. This development is significant for investors and the beverage industry, as it reflects the company's commitment to maintaining its presence on a major stock exchange and its dedication to long-term success.</p>
