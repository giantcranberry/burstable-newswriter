<p>Kamada Ltd., a leader in plasma-derived therapeutics, has reported a notable financial performance for 2024, with annual revenue reaching $161 million, marking a 13% increase from the previous year. The company also saw a substantial 75% rise in net income, underscoring its financial health and operational efficiency. This growth is largely attributed to the strong demand for its FDA-approved specialty therapies, including KEDRAB速 and CYTOGAM速, which have shown significant sales potential.</p><p>In a move that reflects its robust financial position, Kamada announced a special cash dividend of 20 cents per share. Looking ahead, the company is optimistic about its growth trajectory, projecting revenues between $178 million and $182 million for 2025, which would represent a 12% year-over-year increase. This optimism is fueled by strategic initiatives aimed at expanding its product portfolio and enhancing its global footprint.</p><p>Among these initiatives is the launch of biosimilar products in Israel, with plans to introduce 1-3 products annually. This strategy is expected to generate $15-20 million in annual sales within five years. Additionally, Kamada is expanding its plasma collection capabilities with a new facility in San Antonio, Texas, anticipated to contribute $8-10 million in annual revenue.</p><p>Internationally, the company has secured a $25 million contract to supply KAMRAB速 and VARIZIG速 in South America from 2025 through 2027, highlighting its growing presence in global markets. Kamada is also exploring strategic mergers, acquisitions, and business development opportunities to further accelerate its revenue growth.</p><p>A significant future opportunity for Kamada lies in its phase 3 trial of an inhaled alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) therapy, targeting a genetic disorder that can lead to lung damage. With an estimated market potential exceeding $2 billion, this therapy could represent a major commercial breakthrough for the company upon approval.</p><p>CEO Amir London has emphasized Kamada's commitment to innovation and global expansion as key drivers of its multi-year growth outlook. By leveraging its expertise in plasma-derived therapeutics and pursuing strategic business initiatives, Kamada is well-positioned to sustain its success in the competitive biopharmaceutical industry.</p>
