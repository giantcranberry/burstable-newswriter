<p>The DFW Car & Toy Museum has recently added a rare gem to its collection, a 1966 Mercedes-Benz 600 Six-Door Pullman Limousine, underscoring the museum's commitment to preserving automotive history. This vehicle is not just a testament to luxury but also to the technological innovations of its time. With only 42 six-door configurations produced out of 428 long-wheelbase 600 Pullman limousines, and this model being one of the 11 equipped with both a factory sunroof and air conditioning, its rarity is undeniable.</p><p>The Mercedes-Benz 600 series, introduced at the 1963 Frankfurt Motor Show, was ahead of its time, featuring an advanced hydraulic system that powered nearly every function of the vehicle, including a self-leveling air suspension. This made it a favorite among world leaders, celebrities, and dignitaries, symbolizing status and technological prowess. The specific limousine now housed at the DFW Car & Toy Museum has a unique history, having been initially used by Mercedes-Benz to transport VIP guests and later owned by Klaus Kienle, a key figure in the 600 series production.</p><p>Today, the limousine stands as a beautifully preserved piece of automotive history, with documented maintenance by the Mercedes-Benz Classic Center USA. While it has been subtly updated with modern entertainment features, it retains its original mid-century charm. The museum's new location at 2550 McMillan Parkway in Fort Worth, opening in early 2025, will offer visitors a chance to admire this and over 150 other collector cars and 3,000 antique automotive toys, all with free admission.</p><p>This unveiling is significant not only for car enthusiasts but also for those interested in the evolution of automotive technology and luxury. The Mercedes-Benz 600 Six-Door Pullman Limousine represents a pivotal moment in automotive design and engineering, offering insights into the standards of luxury and innovation that continue to influence the industry today.</p>
