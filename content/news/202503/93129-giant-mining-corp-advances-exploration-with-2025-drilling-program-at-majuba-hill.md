<p>Giant Mining Corp. has commenced its 2025 core drilling program at the Majuba Hill Copper-Silver-Gold Project in Pershing County, Nevada, signaling a pivotal advancement in the company's exploration strategy. The program's inaugural drill hole, MHB-32, aims to extend known copper mineralization zones and assess potential resource estimation, building on the high-grade discoveries from the 2024 drill holes MHB-30 and MHB-31.</p><p>The initiative plans for up to four drill holes, totaling 4,400 feet, with an initial commitment of at least 2,600 feet. Each hole is designed to penetrate depths of 1,100 feet, with possibilities of extending to 1,600 feet based on mineralization continuity. A standout feature of this campaign is the partnership with Exploration Technologies, utilizing artificial intelligence and cloud computing to pinpoint optimal drilling locations. This collaboration has refined exploration accuracy by analyzing geophysical data to identify breccia zones and low-resistivity anomalies.</p><p>Located in Nevada, ranked as the premier mining jurisdiction by the Fraser Institute, the Majuba Hill Project spans 9,684 acres and benefits from significant infrastructure advantages, including easy access to transportation routes and essential resources. The drilling program unfolds against a backdrop of robust copper prices, approximately $5.12 per pound, enhancing the project's mineralization value.</p><p>CEO David Greenway emphasizes the drilling's role in unlocking shareholder value, highlighting the project's potential for a substantial copper-silver-gold mineralized system. The exploration seeks to broaden known mineral zones and possibly delineate deeper copper system extensions. Geological evaluations suggest the project may host a large mineralized body, with prior drilling efforts amounting to 83,930 feet and around $10.4 million in development costs. Initial surveys indicate mineralization remains open in various directions, pointing to considerable expansion opportunities.</p><p>By integrating cutting-edge technologies and operating within a mining-conducive jurisdiction, Giant Mining Corp. is well-positioned to meet the escalating global demand for critical metals, particularly those essential for green energy infrastructure and electric vehicle technologies.</p>
