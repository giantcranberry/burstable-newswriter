<p>Durango Resources Inc. has announced its transition to Quantum Critical Metals Corp., effective March 17, 2025, marking a strategic pivot towards the exploration and development of critical minerals. This rebranding, accompanied by a new ticker symbol 'LEAP' on the TSX Venture Exchange, underscores the company's alignment with the increasing global demand for critical metals, essential for renewable energy systems, defense applications, and advanced electronics.</p><p>The move reflects broader industry and geopolitical trends, including the identification of critical minerals by both the United States and Canada as vital to economic and national security. With China's dominant position in the production and processing of several critical minerals, recent export restrictions have amplified concerns over global supply chain stability, making the diversification of sources a strategic imperative.</p><p>Quantum Critical Metals Corp. holds a 100% interest in several strategic properties, including the NMX East Gallium & Critical Metals Project near Qu√©bec's Whabouchi lithium deposit, and claims in the Babine Copper-Gold Porphyry District and Troilus Gold Camp. The company's experienced management team is poised to explore new mineral discoveries, contributing to Canada's critical minerals strategy and addressing the global need for secure and sustainable mineral supplies.</p><p>Shareholders are advised that the name change will not necessitate any action on their part, with existing share certificates remaining valid. The transition represents a timely strategic realignment, positioning Quantum Critical Metals Corp. at the forefront of meeting the challenges and opportunities presented by the global demand for critical minerals.</p>
