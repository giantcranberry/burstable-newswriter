<p>Vertical IQ has recently upgraded its Industry Intelligence platform by integrating Canada-specific financial benchmark data, a move designed to equip businesses and professionals with a deeper understanding of industry performance metrics. This enhancement leverages data from the Government of Canada's annual Financial Performance Data, offering detailed financial ratios and statements for businesses within two revenue brackets: $30,000 to $5 million and $5 million to $20 million.</p><p>The addition includes critical financial ratios such as current ratio, debt-to-equity ratio, and return on assets, alongside comprehensive income statements and balance sheets. Drake Branson, Director of Product at Vertical IQ, highlighted the value of these benchmarks in setting improvement standards and identifying efficiency gains for businesses.</p><p>This update reflects an understanding of the Canadian economy's unique aspects, where industry performance can vary by region. For example, financial benchmarks for an aluminum production business in Edmonton may differ from those in the U.S. Vertical IQ plans to refresh this data annually, ensuring access to up-to-date industry performance information.</p><p>By providing localized financial benchmarks, Vertical IQ aims to support a wide range of professionals, including accountants, bankers, and consultants, with actionable insights for strategic planning and optimizing business performance.</p>
