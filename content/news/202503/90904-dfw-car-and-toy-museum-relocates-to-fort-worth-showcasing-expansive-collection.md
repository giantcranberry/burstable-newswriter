<p>The DFW Car and Toy Museum, under the stewardship of collector Ron Sturgeon, has successfully transitioned to its new Fort Worth location, drawing over 600 visitors on its opening day. This move to a 150,000-square-foot facility at 2550 McMillan Parkway marks a significant expansion from its former Haltom City site, promising an enriched experience for enthusiasts of automotive and toy history.</p><p>Sturgeon's journey from toy collecting in the 1980s to amassing a notable collection of over 200 cars and 3,000 toys through his auto salvage business is at the heart of the museum's appeal. The new venue, with its strategic placement near Interstate 35 and enhanced visibility, underscores the museum's commitment to accessibility and community engagement.</p><p>Extensive renovations have transformed the space, with updates ranging from painting and tiling to the removal of outdated elements like shag carpeting, all aimed at creating a contemporary and inviting atmosphere. The collection boasts more than 35 Volkswagens, a nod to Sturgeon's early career in the automotive industry, and is complemented by free admission and parking, ensuring the museum is open to all.</p><p>Looking ahead, the museum is set to host the Antique Toy Collectors of America's annual convention on May 5, 2025, and a cars and coffee event on April 12, anticipated to attract a sizable audience. Operating hours are Tuesday through Saturday from 9:00 am to 6:00 pm, with additional offerings such as climate-controlled car storage and event facilities. The museum's dog-friendly policy and encouragement of photography further enhance its appeal as a dynamic and interactive destination for collectors and families alike.</p>
