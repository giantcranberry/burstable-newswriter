<p>Splash Beverage Group has implemented a 40-to-1 reverse stock split in response to its share price falling below NYSE minimum requirements, aiming to stabilize its market position with shares expected to trade at approximately $2.80 post-split. This financial maneuver is part of a broader strategy to ensure the company's compliance with exchange standards and to attract future investment.</p><p>Accompanying this strategic financial adjustment, Splash Beverage Group has announced significant leadership changes. William (Bill) Devereux has been appointed as the new Chief Financial Officer, bringing over two decades of corporate finance and investment management experience to the role. Devereux's appointment is seen as a key step in the company's transformation efforts. Additionally, Tom Fore, a seasoned entrepreneur with a strong background in structured finance, has joined the board of directors. Fore's expertise in mergers, acquisitions, and corporate restructuring is expected to provide valuable strategic direction.</p><p>The company has also engaged an advisory group to explore funding opportunities and tackle liquidity challenges, underscoring its commitment to overcoming current financial hurdles. Despite these challenges, Splash Beverage Group remains optimistic about the growth potential of its e-commerce and branded beverage divisions. Notable achievements include Qplash reaching significant revenue milestones and the upcoming launch of Chispo Tequila, which has already garnered positive market feedback.</p><p>While the reverse stock split was not part of the company's initial plans, it is viewed as a necessary step to reduce outstanding shares, limit float, and potentially stabilize the share price. Splash Beverage Group is focused on executing its strategic vision, which includes expanding its portfolio of both alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverage brands, and believes these measures will support long-term value creation for its shareholders.</p>
