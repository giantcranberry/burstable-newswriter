<p>Sky Harbour Group Corporation (NYSE: SKYH) has demonstrated exceptional financial performance and strategic progress in its aviation infrastructure portfolio for fiscal year 2024, marking a period of significant growth and operational success. The company's third-quarter results highlight a 64% year-over-year increase in lease revenue, reaching $4.1 million, and a 90% surge in total revenue to $10.1 million. With occupancy rates holding steady at 97%, the company's effective asset management and market demand are evident.</p><p>Strategic new lease agreements have expanded Sky Harbour's leased square footage to approximately 580,000 square feet, with construction projects on track to add 1,904,761 square feet of new developments by fiscal year 2025. These developments are expected to contribute an additional $37.6 million in annual revenue, reinforcing the company's aggressive growth strategy. Despite a slight decrease in operating income to $(4.9) million, attributed to increased ground lease expenses and personnel costs, the company's financial health remains strong, with total assets at $456.8 million and a liquidity position of $110.3 million.</p><p>A recent private investment in public equity (PIPE) raise in December bolstered the company's liquidity by $37.6 million, providing a solid foundation for future expansion. Stonegate Capital Partners' valuation analysis estimates the company's stock value between $12.79 and $21.17, reflecting confidence in Sky Harbour's growth trajectory. With seven new ground leases anticipated in fiscal year 2025 and a focus on infrastructure development, Sky Harbour Group Corporation is poised for continued expansion and the potential to achieve positive EBITDA by fiscal year 2026.</p>
