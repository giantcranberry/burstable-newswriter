<p>A recent survey conducted by Debt.com has shed light on the escalating financial strain on American households, revealing a growing dependency on credit cards to cover basic living expenses amidst rising inflation. The 2025 Credit Card Survey found that 37% of Americans are now regularly using credit cards to make ends meet, a clear indicator of the economic challenges facing consumers today.</p><p>The survey, which polled 1,000 adults, uncovered concerning trends in credit card usage and debt. Notably, 32% of respondents have maxed out their credit cards, with 44% reporting larger monthly balances due to inflation. The data also revealed generational disparities, with Millennials (42%) and Gen Xers (39%) more likely to max out their credit cards compared to Gen Z (32%) and Baby Boomers (14%).</p><p>Further compounding the issue, over 63% of participants carry a credit card balance, and more than 20% owe in excess of $10,000. An alarming 80% of those with maxed-out cards would still turn to credit in a financial emergency, underscoring the fragile financial state of many households.</p><p>This survey comes at a time when Senators Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Anna Paulina Luna are pushing for bipartisan legislation to cap credit card interest rates at 10%. Howard Dvorkin, CPA and Chairman of Debt.com, highlighted the potential impact of such a measure, especially given that 27% of survey respondents are unaware of their current credit card Annual Percentage Rate (APR).</p><p>Adding to the context, consumer sentiment data from the University of Michigan reflects a downturn in confidence, attributed to economic uncertainty, ongoing inflation, and high borrowing costs. Despite these pressures, 57% of those surveyed have never considered debt relief options like credit counseling, balance transfers, or debt consolidation.</p><p>The findings underscore the critical need for enhanced financial literacy and proactive measures to assist Americans in managing their finances in an increasingly complex economic environment. As inflation continues to squeeze household budgets, the importance of understanding and effectively managing credit card debt has never been more paramount.</p>
