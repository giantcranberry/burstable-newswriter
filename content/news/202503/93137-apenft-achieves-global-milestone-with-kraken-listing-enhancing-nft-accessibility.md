This development introduces APENFT/USD and APENFT/EUR trading pairs, facilitating direct access to major fiat markets globally, including North America, Europe, and the Asia-Pacific region. The listing underscores APENFT's rapid growth since its inception in 2021, boasting a market capitalization exceeding $430 million and attracting over 2.16 million unique holders.</p><p>The platform has distinguished itself through innovative ventures in the digital collectibles domain, including partnerships with elite auction houses Christie's and Sotheby's. These collaborations have enabled the tokenization of artworks by iconic artists such as Picasso and Andy Warhol, bridging the gap between traditional art and the digital realm. APENFT's achievements also include the launch of the APENFT Marketplace, a top-tier NFT trading platform on the TRON blockchain, and the introduction of NFT Pump, a tool that simplifies and reduces the cost of NFT minting. The recent release of NFT Pump 2.0, incorporating the TRC404 standard, further enhances trading liquidity and user experience.</p><p>Complementing the Kraken listing, APENFT has announced a $90,000 airdrop via the Reef Program, aimed at fostering user engagement and extending the platform's reach beyond its current ecosystem. Kraken's adherence to stringent compliance and security measures offers APENFT a reputable venue to bolster its market standing.
