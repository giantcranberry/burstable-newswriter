<p>Silver Crown Royalties Inc. has announced the successful closing of the second tranche of its non-brokered private placement, raising approximately C$489,515. This was achieved through the issuance of 75,310 units, each priced at C$6.50, comprising one common share and one common share purchase warrant. The warrant grants investors the right to acquire an additional common share at C$13.00 within three years from the closing date. This latest tranche brings the total number of units issued to 142,848, amassing cumulative gross proceeds of C$928,512.</p><p>The proceeds from this offering are earmarked for strategic purposes, including partially financing the second tranche of the company's silver royalty acquisition on the Igor 4 project in Peru, alongside covering general and administrative expenses. All securities issued are bound by a standard four-month and one-day statutory hold period, in strict adherence to securities legislation.</p><p>As a publicly traded entity specializing in silver royalties, Silver Crown currently holds four silver royalties, three of which are already revenue-generating. The company's innovative business model offers investors exposure to precious metals, serving as a natural hedge against currency devaluation and buffering against the adverse effects of production cost inflation. This development underscores Silver Crown's commitment to expanding its portfolio and enhancing shareholder value in the competitive precious metals sector.</p>
