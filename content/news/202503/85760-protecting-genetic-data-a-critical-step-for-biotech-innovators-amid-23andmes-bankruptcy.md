<p>The recent Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing by 23andMe, coupled with a significant data breach affecting nearly seven million Americans, has raised alarms about the security of genetic data. Michigan-based intellectual property law firm The Patent Baron PLLC is urging clients to take immediate action to protect their sensitive information. This situation underscores the broader implications for privacy and intellectual property, especially for those in the biotechnology and health-related sectors.</p><p>Genetic testing company 23andMe's bankruptcy announcement on March 23, 2025, has sparked concerns over the handling of consumer genetic information. Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel has advised users to consider deleting their accounts and requesting the destruction of stored data and DNA samples. The Patent Baron highlights that compromised genetic information goes beyond basic health data, potentially revealing family lineage, inheritance, and discoveries in biotechnology and diagnostics.</p><p>The firm recommends three essential steps for individuals and businesses: deleting 23andMe account data, destroying stored DNA samples, and revoking previous research consent. These measures aim to prevent the misuse or unauthorized monetization of personal genetic information. For inventors, scientists, and entrepreneurs, the stakes are particularly high, as genetic information can become an intellectual property liability.</p><p>This development serves as a stark reminder of the importance of proactive data management in the digital age. Protecting genetic information is not just about privacy; it's a critical step in safeguarding potential innovations and intellectual property in the fast-evolving biotech industry. The implications of this breach and bankruptcy extend far beyond the individuals directly affected, signaling a wake-up call for the entire sector to reevaluate data protection strategies.</p>
