<p>Robert L. Foster's provocative new book, 'Subordinating American Democracy: Exploring the Functionality of 'Dysfunctional' Hyperpartisanship,' delves into the complex dynamics of political polarization in the United States. Foster presents a nuanced argument that hyperpartisanship is not merely a product of deliberate manipulation but an adaptive response to evolving societal conditions. This perspective challenges conventional narratives and invites a deeper understanding of the forces shaping American political life.</p><p>The book meticulously examines the ecosystem that fosters political division, highlighting the role of media incentives, political strategies, and structural changes. Foster introduces the concept of the 'Partisanship Industry,' a system that thrives on and markets division, benefiting financially and culturally from the status quo. This analysis reveals how hyperpartisanship, while disruptive to governance, serves specific interests within society.</p><p>Drawing on his extensive experience in advocacy, government relations, and policy work, Foster offers a multifaceted view of political narratives and their societal impacts. His interdisciplinary background, including a degree in Interdisciplinary Studies and a law degree earned magna cum laude, lends scholarly rigor to his exploration of political systems' adaptability and the implications for democratic processes.</p><p>'Subordinating American Democracy' not only shifts the focus from the content of political disagreements to the processes that manage these conflicts but also proposes potential pathways for mitigating the challenges posed by hyperpartisanship. Foster's work is a critical resource for understanding the persistent nature of political division and its consequences for democracy.</p><p>The book will be available in various formats, including eBook and paperback, through major retailers such as <a href='https://www.amazon.com' rel='nofollow' target='_blank'>Amazon</a>, <a href='https://www.barnesandnoble.com' rel='nofollow' target='_blank'>Barnes & Noble</a>, <a href='https://play.google.com' rel='nofollow' target='_blank'>Google Play</a>, <a href='https://www.kobo.com' rel='nofollow' target='_blank'>Kobo</a>, and <a href='https://www.ingramspark.com' rel='nofollow' target='_blank'>Ingram Spark</a>, making it accessible to a wide audience interested in the intersection of politics, society, and democracy.</p>
