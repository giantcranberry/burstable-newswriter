<p>Frances Fuller, the author behind the bestselling book 'Helping Yourself Grow Old', has brought attention to a frequently neglected aspect of selecting an assisted living facility: storage space. In a recent blog post, Fuller shared insights on how inadequate storage can lead to unexpected challenges and dissatisfaction among seniors transitioning to new living environments. Her advice, rooted in personal observations and experiences, underscores the necessity of evaluating storage options thoroughly before making a commitment.</p><p>Fuller points out that key considerations should include the size of closets, the availability of additional storage units, and how room dimensions correlate with monthly living costs. While many high-end retirement homes provide lockable and accessible cubicle storage spaces for items like seasonal clothing and holiday decorations, Fuller warns that these should not compensate for the lack of adequate built-in storage within the living space itself.</p><p>For those in the process of selecting an assisted living facility, Fuller advises taking precise measurements of rooms, inquiring in detail about storage options, and realistically assessing how current possessions will fit into the new space. She notes that everyday comfort and convenience can be greatly affected by factors such as closet size, pantry availability, and bathroom storage.</p><p>Fuller's recommendations are part of her broader effort to offer practical, firsthand advice on aging, as detailed in her book 'Helping Yourself Grow Old'. Her work stands out for its personal approach to the subject, contrasting with more academic discussions on aging. The emphasis on storage space is indicative of Fuller's overarching message: the value of meticulous planning in preparing for retirement and senior living. By focusing on these practical details, seniors can enhance their living conditions, ensuring a more comfortable and fulfilling experience in their later years.</p>
