Scheduled for completion by the end of May, the project will operate Monday through Friday from 7 am to 5 pm, potentially affecting local traffic and transportation.</p><p>The construction is expected to bring about road closures, detours, and traffic delays during working hours, alongside parking restrictions on the affected streets.
