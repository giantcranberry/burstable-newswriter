Industries ranging from semiconductors and data centers to natural gas, petrochemicals, and refining stand to benefit from CHARBONE's expanded capabilities.</p><p>With the global industrial gas market projected to grow by USD 31.1 billion between 2024 and 2029, at a compound annual growth rate of 5.7%, CHARBONE's initiatives are timely. The company is not only diversifying its revenue streams but also positioning itself to capitalize on the anticipated market expansion.
