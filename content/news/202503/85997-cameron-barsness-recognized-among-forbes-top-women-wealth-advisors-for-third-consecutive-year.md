<p>Cameron Barsness, a principal at Kutscher Benner Barsness & Stevens (KBBS), has achieved a notable milestone by being recognized for the third year in a row as one of Forbes' Top Women Wealth Advisors Best-In-State for Washington in 2025. This accolade, a result of a collaboration between Forbes and SHOOK Research, shines a spotlight on the achievements of women in the wealth advisory sector, with this year's list featuring around 2,400 advisors overseeing more than $3.6 trillion in assets.</p><p>The selection criteria for this prestigious list are stringent, focusing on both quantitative achievements, such as assets under management, and qualitative factors, including in-depth interviews with nominees. Advisors must also meet specific minimum requirements and uphold a clean compliance record to be eligible. Barsness's inclusion on this list for the third consecutive year is a testament to her exceptional performance and dedication to her clients.</p><p>Scott Benner, another principal at KBBS, commended Barsness for her professional dedication and personalized approach to financial advising. Her ability to consistently deliver tailored financial solutions has not only earned her this recognition but also reinforced KBBS's reputation for providing independent and straightforward financial guidance since its inception in 1991.</p><p>This recognition is significant for the wealth management industry, as it highlights the growing influence and expertise of women advisors in a traditionally male-dominated field. Barsness's repeated success serves as an inspiration for aspiring female financial advisors and underscores the importance of personalized, client-focused financial planning in achieving long-term investment success.</p>
