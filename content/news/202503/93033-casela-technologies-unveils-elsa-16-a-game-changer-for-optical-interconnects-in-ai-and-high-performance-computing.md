<p>Casela Technologies has launched the ELSA-16, an external laser source platform designed to revolutionize optical interconnects in artificial intelligence (AI) and high-performance computing (HPC) systems. This platform combines 16 high-power Distributed Feedback (DFB) lasers with sophisticated control electronics, setting a new standard for performance and scalability in the industry.</p><p>The ELSA-16 platform stands out for its customizable power profiles, with laser outputs ranging from 150 to 200 milliwatts per channel. It accommodates a variety of wavelength configurations, including 1310nm and CWDM-4 options, ensuring versatility across different networking environments. A notable feature is its capacity to produce up to 128 optical channels through 16 x 8-comb source configurations, making it a forward-looking solution for emerging Co-Packaged Optics (CPO) and silicon photonics architectures.</p><p>At the Optical Fiber Communication Conference (OFC) 2025, Casela showcased the ELSA-16's capabilities, highlighting a 16-wavelength version that supports over 128 channels in a compact, pluggable form factor. Milind Gokhale, the company's Chief Technology Officer, contributed to a panel discussion on the future of laser architecture and optical interconnects for AI and machine learning applications, underscoring the platform's significance.</p><p>The ELSA-16 is engineered to tackle key challenges in AI infrastructure, boasting superior wall plug efficiency and precise wavelength control. Its support for high-density, parallel optical links paves the way for more compact, energy-efficient, and cost-effective optical interconnect solutions. With its ability to facilitate dense wavelength division multiplexing and compatibility with advanced silicon modulators, the ELSA-16 is poised to be instrumental in the development of next-generation high-bandwidth computing infrastructure. Its modular and scalable design makes it an ideal choice for organizations aiming to enhance their AI and HPC systems.</p>
