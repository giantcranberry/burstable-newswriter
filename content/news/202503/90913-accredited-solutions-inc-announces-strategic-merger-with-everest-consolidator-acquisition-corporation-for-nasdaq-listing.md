<p>Accredited Solutions, Inc. (OTC: ASII) has taken a significant step towards expanding its market presence by signing a Letter of Intent (LOI) with Everest Consolidator Acquisition Corporation (EVCO) for a merger that will see the combined entity listed on the Nasdaq exchange. This strategic move is poised to offer ASII shareholders approximately 70% ownership in the new entity, notably without the necessity of a reverse stock split, marking a pivotal moment for the company and its stakeholders.</p><p>The timing of this merger is particularly noteworthy, occurring amidst a challenging environment for Special Purpose Acquisition Companies (SPACs) in identifying viable merger partners. This scenario has inadvertently opened doors for smaller entities like Accredited Solutions to explore listing avenues that are both strategic and cost-effective, leveraging the current market dynamics to their advantage.</p><p>Eduardo Brito, the CEO of Accredited Solutions, has underscored the anticipated advantages of the Nasdaq listing, which include heightened visibility, bolstered credibility, and better access to institutional investors. These benefits are expected to facilitate the company's ability to secure capital at more favorable terms, thereby accelerating its acquisition strategy and fostering long-term growth.</p><p>The proposed merger entails EVCO acquiring 100% of ASII through a share exchange transaction. The parties involved are aiming to finalize a definitive merger agreement within the next 30 days, with the transaction expected to close within 150 days, subject to the fulfillment of standard regulatory approvals and conditions.</p><p>As a holding company with a keen focus on the technology sector, Accredited Solutions is committed to the acquisition and growth of businesses operating within fintech, blockchain, and digital assets. The merger with EVCO is not just a testament to the company's ambitious growth strategy but also positions it to capitalize on broader market opportunities, ultimately aiming to deliver enhanced value to its shareholders.</p>
