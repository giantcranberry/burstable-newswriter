<p>Sky Harbour Group Corporation (NYSE: SKYH) has announced impressive financial results for fiscal year 2024, marking a period of substantial growth and strategic expansion in the aviation infrastructure sector. The company reported consolidated revenues of $14.8 million, a 95% increase year-over-year, driven by strategic lease initiations, campus optimization, and the acquisition of new facilities such as the Camarillo campus. This growth underscores the company's ability to thrive even in challenging economic conditions.</p><p>The expansion of Sky Harbour's operational footprint is a key highlight of the fiscal year, with the company now operating campuses at multiple strategic locations. A notable addition is the newly executed lease at Seattle's Boeing Field, which added approximately 90,000 rentable square feet to the company's portfolio. Currently, Sky Harbour's portfolio encompasses approximately 580,000 leasable square feet, with over 2.1 million square feet under construction or development. These developments are projected to generate additional annual revenue of approximately $37.6 million upon completion, signaling strong future growth potential.</p><p>Financially, Sky Harbour demonstrated steady improvement, with gross margins increasing to 14.5% in the fourth quarter of 2024, up from 10.2% sequentially. Although operating income saw a slight decrease to $(5.4) million, primarily due to increased operational expenses, the company remains optimistic about its path to profitability. Sky Harbour's robust balance sheet, with total assets of $556.6 million and liquidity totaling approximately $127.0 million at year-end, further solidifies its financial standing. The successful completion of a $75.0 million PIPE equity placement in December highlights investor confidence in the company's strategic direction.</p><p>Looking ahead, Sky Harbour is well-positioned to potentially achieve an investment-grade bond rating in fiscal year 2025, according to Stonegate Capital Partners' valuation analysis. With ongoing construction projects at key locations such as Phoenix Deer Valley Airport, Addison Dallas Airport, and an upcoming facility in Denver Centennial Airport, Sky Harbour continues to expand its strategic aviation infrastructure portfolio. This expansion not only enhances the company's growth prospects but also contributes to the broader business aviation sector's development, making Sky Harbour's achievements a significant milestone for the industry.</p>
