<p>Mariner, a leading national financial services firm, has taken a decisive step forward in its expansion strategy by fully integrating Ocean Heights Advisors, a Newport Beach-based wealth management firm with $730 million in assets under advisement. This move not only underscores Mariner's commitment to fostering long-term business continuity but also highlights its innovative approach to advisor succession and client service enhancement.</p><p>The partnership between Mariner and Ocean Heights began in 2022, allowing Ocean Heights to leverage Mariner's operational support while retaining its independence. This collaboration proved fruitful, enabling Ocean Heights to nearly double its assets under advisement and broaden its client service offerings. The full integration signifies a new chapter for both firms, with all Ocean Heights team members, including founders Kevin O'Grady and Nella Webster, continuing in their current roles. Notably, partners Kevin Barlow, Danielle Bronner, and Kara Devar will transition into Mariner shareholders, with Barlow at the helm of the expanded Newport Beach operations.</p><p>Marty Bicknell, CEO and president of Mariner, highlighted the strategic significance of this transition, pointing to Mariner's dedication to providing financial advisors with a clear succession pathway and a seamless client experience. This model allows advisors the flexibility to maintain their independence initially, with the option to fully integrate into Mariner's comprehensive infrastructure down the line. Such an approach not only ensures business continuity but also equips advisors with expanded resources, all while maintaining uninterrupted service for clients.</p><p>The agreement, finalized in December 2024 and effective as of April 1, 2025, represents a milestone in Mariner's journey from its inception in 2006 with $300 million in assets under advisement to its current position advising on over $560 billion in assets. This growth trajectory reflects Mariner's strategic vision and its role as a forward-thinking leader in the financial services industry. By offering ownership opportunities to the next generation of financial professionals, Mariner is setting a new standard for advisory firm succession and industry innovation.</p>
