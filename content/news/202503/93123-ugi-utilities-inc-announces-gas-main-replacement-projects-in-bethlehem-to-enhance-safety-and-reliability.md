<p>UGI Utilities, Inc. is launching comprehensive gas main replacement projects in Bethlehem starting April 1, focusing on several city streets to upgrade the local utility infrastructure. These projects are designed to bolster safety and ensure the reliability of gas services for residents and businesses alike.</p><p>The initiative includes two main projects. The first, expected to wrap up by late April, will concentrate on Seneca Street between North Hoffert and North Bergan Streets, with construction activities scheduled from Monday to Friday, 7 am to 5 pm. The second project, with a mid-May completion target, involves more extensive work on East 3rd Street, South New Street, Columbia Street, and Adams Street, likely leading to road closures, traffic detours, and parking limitations during construction hours.</p><p>Temporary natural gas service interruptions may occur as a result of the construction. UGI has assured that its representatives will coordinate with property owners for necessary access to inspect and relight gas equipment, aiming to minimize service disruptions.</p><p>This infrastructure overhaul underscores UGI Utilities, Inc.'s dedication to modernizing Bethlehem's utility systems. By replacing outdated gas mains, the company aims to enhance system efficiency, decrease the likelihood of service interruptions, and improve community safety. Additionally, the projects offer an opportunity for properties along the affected routes to switch to natural gas, potentially providing more efficient and economical energy options.</p><p>While the projects have outlined timelines, completion dates may vary depending on weather conditions and specific work scenarios. UGI advises residents and businesses in the impacted areas to stay informed about construction progress and any resulting traffic adjustments.</p>
