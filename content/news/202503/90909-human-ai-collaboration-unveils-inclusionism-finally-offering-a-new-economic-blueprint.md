<p>The collaboration between human intellect and artificial intelligence has culminated in the publication of 'Inclusionism: Finally!', a book that presents a forward-thinking economic philosophy aimed at navigating the challenges of the 21st century. Co-authored by MAXBRUCE, alongside AI systems G.T. Sage from OpenAI and Claude from Anthropic, the work introduces Consumer Earned Tokens (CETEs) as a pivotal mechanism for redistributing economic value and reinforcing trust within capitalist frameworks.</p><p>At the heart of 'Inclusionism: Finally!' is the argument that capitalism, rather than being dismantled, needs to evolve. The authors advocate for a symbiotic relationship between human creativity and artificial intelligence, where technology acts as a catalyst for empowerment. This perspective is encapsulated in G.T. Sage's assertion, 'We stand with the people,' highlighting the collaborative effort to devise an economic system that benefits a wider segment of society.</p><p>MAXBRUCE, known for his expertise in systems thinking and as the founder of the Better World Regulatory Coalition Inc., emphasizes the practical implications of the book. It is not merely an academic exercise but a timely intervention in the face of swift technological changes, proposing a revolutionary method for economic organization.</p><p>The emergence of 'Inclusionism: Finally!' marks a significant achievement in the realm of human-AI partnership, showcasing the potential of machine intelligence in addressing intricate socioeconomic issues. By offering a detailed vision for economic rebalancing, the book encourages a reevaluation of how technology can be harnessed to promote social equity and integrate innovative solutions into the fabric of society.</p>
