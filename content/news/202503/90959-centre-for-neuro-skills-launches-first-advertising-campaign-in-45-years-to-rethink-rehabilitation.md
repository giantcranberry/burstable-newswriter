<p>The Centre for Neuro Skills (CNS), a pioneer in traumatic brain injury and stroke rehabilitation, has unveiled its first advertising campaign in over four decades. Dubbed 'Rethink Rehab,' this initiative is designed to engage medical decision-makers, potential patients, and their families across digital video platforms, social media, and out-of-home advertising channels. The campaign's core message revolves around the transformative power of specialized neurorehabilitation, illustrated through compelling narratives of hope and recovery.</p><p>At the heart of 'Rethink Rehab' is a 30-second video spot, crafted in collaboration with Moon Rabbit, an independent advertising agency. This poignant piece traces a mother's arduous journey towards recovery following a brain injury, underscoring the pivotal role of CNS's tailored rehabilitation services in her ability to reclaim independence. Ben Ashley, Associate Vice President of Marketing and Communications at CNS, highlights the campaign's strategic intent to foster awareness and understanding of neurorehabilitation's benefits before the need arises.</p><p>John Tenaglia of Moon Rabbit emphasizes the campaign's focus on infusing the often sterile discourse around rehabilitation with genuine human emotion and connection. To achieve broad reach and impact, the campaign employs a diverse mix of digital banners, radio spots, social media engagements, and advertorials. Launched on February 1, 2025, 'Rethink Rehab' marks a significant milestone in CNS's mission to demystify neurorehabilitation and enhance access to life-changing care.</p><p>This initiative not only signifies CNS's commitment to innovation in patient care but also sets a new standard for how rehabilitation services are perceived and promoted. By leveraging storytelling and strategic media placement, CNS aims to shift public attitudes towards brain injury recovery, emphasizing the possibilities of hope, healing, and renewed independence.</p>
