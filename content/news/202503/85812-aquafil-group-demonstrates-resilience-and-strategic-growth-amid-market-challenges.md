The company's financial results revealed revenues of €128.4 million, with a notable 36.0% year-over-year increase in adjusted EBITDA. A key highlight was the expansion of its ECONYL® regenerated nylon product line, which accounted for 57.2% of fiber revenues, marking a 50-basis-point increase from the previous quarter.</p><p>Geographically, Aquafil faced mixed conditions, with North American markets experiencing volume declines, while the EMEA and Asia Pacific regions showed growth and met budget expectations.

With cost-cutting measures in place and the benefit of a covenant holiday from lenders, the company is well-positioned for future growth and improved financial performance.</p><p>The significance of Aquafil's performance lies not only in its financial achievements but also in its commitment to sustainability through the ECONYL® product line. This focus on sustainable innovation is increasingly important to consumers and industries alike, positioning Aquafil as a leader in the transition towards more environmentally friendly manufacturing practices. The company's strategic adaptations and financial improvements serve as a testament to its resilience and forward-thinking approach in a challenging market environment.</p>
