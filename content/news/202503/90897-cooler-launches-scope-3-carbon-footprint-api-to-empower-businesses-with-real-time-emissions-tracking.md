<p>Cooler has introduced a Scope 3 Carbon Footprint API, a tool designed to help enterprise IT managers and software developers incorporate real-time carbon emissions estimates into their applications and workflows. This innovative API offers a science-backed, greenhouse gas-compliant carbon calculator that spans hundreds of product and service categories, facilitating seamless integration with major platforms such as Microsoft, Google, AWS, and Shopify.</p><p>Charlie Crystle, CEO of Cooler, highlighted the significance of this development in the context of increasing consumer awareness and concern over global warming. With over 70% of US consumers expressing worry about climate change and expecting businesses to act, the API serves as a critical tool for companies aiming to meet these expectations and foster trust among environmentally conscious customers.</p><p>The API stands out for its developer-friendly documentation and scalable architecture, making it accessible to a wide range of organizations, from emerging startups to established Fortune 500 companies. Unlike other solutions that rely on AI-generated estimates, Cooler's approach ensures reliability by avoiding what Crystle describes as unreliable guesses based on outdated data.</p><p>By enabling the measurement, storage, and retrieval of emissions data across various product categories, the API provides businesses with a comprehensive mechanism to understand and mitigate their environmental footprint. This initiative by Cooler represents a significant step forward in empowering organizations to take actionable steps towards sustainability, aligning with global efforts to combat climate change.</p>
