<p>The recent sale of a five-story building at 399 Washington Street in downtown Boston marks a significant transaction in the city's real estate market, showcasing the enduring appeal of urban properties to investors. Boston Realty Advisors facilitated the sale on behalf of a bank lender, with the property being acquired by a joint venture between Hudson Group and Assembly Investments in an all-cash deal. This transaction not only exceeded pricing expectations but also highlighted the strategic market expertise involved in such high-stakes real estate deals.</p><p>Originally purchased for $63 million in 2017, the property underwent substantial renovations in 2021, including the installation of LEED-certified base building systems, with costs ranging between $7 million and $10 million.
