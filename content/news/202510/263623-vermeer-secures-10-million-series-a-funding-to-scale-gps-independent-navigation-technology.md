<p>Vermeer, an American-Ukrainian startup specializing in vision navigation and autonomy technologies for defense applications, has closed a $10 million Series A funding round. The investment was led by Draper Associates and included participation from Los Angeles-based AeroX Ventures, Boscolo Intervest, High Point Ventures, Rockaway Ventures, and the U.S. Air Force Techstars accelerator program.</p><p>The funding will support expansion of Vermeer's partnerships with U.S. military forces, NATO allies, and the Armed Forces of Ukraine while scaling its optical navigation technology for both defense and commercial sectors. The company's Visual Positioning System technology provides a GPS-independent navigation solution critical for drones and other aerial vehicles operating in contested or GPS-denied environments.</p><p>Vermeer's VPS system employs multiple electro-optical or infrared cameras to interpret the surrounding environment by comparing live visuals against a database of landmarks and pre-existing maps, enhanced by AI processing via Nvidia chips. This approach allows drones to maintain precise location awareness even when GPS signals are jammed or spoofed, a vulnerability commonly exploited in modern conflicts.</p><p>The startup has demonstrated significant growth, expanding from 10 to 40 employees within a year while maintaining operations in both New York and Kyiv. Vermeer credits its early development to the U.S. Air Force's Techstars accelerator and significant non-dilutive Small Business Innovation Research funding through the AFWERX program, which have supported its research and development efforts.</p><p>Vermeer's customer base includes over 30 organizations, including the U.S. Army, U.S. Air Force, Lockheed Martin, and Northrop Grumman, with active deployment by Ukrainian forces to maintain drone efficacy against adversarial electronic warfare. Building advanced technology in a war zone is not easy but it's the only way to make it real, said Vermeer CEO Brian Streem. Operating alongside our partners on the front lines has forced us to iterate faster, build smarter, and focus on what actually works in combat.</p><p>Our goal isn't just to give drones mass it's to give them precision, intelligence, and purpose. We're proud to have earned the trust of over 30 customers, and with the support of Draper, and our other venture partners, we're ready to scale that mission, he added. The $10 million funding round is intended to further accelerate product innovation and meet increasing demand from defense and commercial clients worldwide.</p><p>In the broader defense technology landscape, Vermeer's funding round represents a strategic investment in navigation resilience that addresses specific critical capabilities complementing broader autonomous system developments. As geopolitical tensions and cyber-electronic warfare intensify, navigation solutions resistant to jamming and spoofing represent a vital niche within drone and autonomous platform sectors, with implications for military operations, commercial drone applications, and global security infrastructure.</p>
