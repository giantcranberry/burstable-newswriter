<p>Wearable Devices Ltd. has strengthened its intellectual property position in the rapidly expanding $260 billion AI wearables market with the granting of a new U.S. patent covering neural interface technology. The patent, titled 'Gesture and Voice-Controlled Interface Device,' represents a significant advancement in neural interface intellectual property by protecting technology that measures weight, torque, and force directly from wrist-based sensors.</p><p>Unlike typical gesture patents focused on movement recognition, this protection covers neural measurement of physical forces including weight estimation, torque measurement for rotating objects, and applied force quantification for precise assembly tasks. These capabilities transform neural interfaces from entertainment accessories into industrial tools with applications spanning extended reality (XR), industrial automation, and assistive technology. The patent protects technology that can measure torque when fastening screws, estimate object weight during lifting operations, and quantify connector seating force in cable harness assembly.</p><p>Such applications address real operational challenges in manufacturing, logistics, and maintenance environments where precise force feedback improves quality and safety. The technology represents a shift from conventional gesture recognition systems to more sophisticated neural measurement capabilities that could revolutionize how workers interact with digital systems in industrial settings. By enabling precise measurement of physical forces through wrist-worn devices, the technology opens new possibilities for quality control, safety monitoring, and training applications across multiple industries.</p><p>The patent also encompasses voice-controlled interfaces and innovations in brain-computer interfaces, further strengthening the company's position in the competitive wearables market. Additional information about the company's developments is available in their <a href="https://ibn.fm/WLDS" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">newsroom</a>.</p><p>This patent grant comes at a time when the AI wearables market continues to expand rapidly, with companies seeking competitive advantages through proprietary technology. The ability to measure and quantify physical forces through neural interfaces could provide significant operational benefits in sectors requiring precise manual operations, potentially reducing errors and improving worker safety in manufacturing and assembly environments.</p>
