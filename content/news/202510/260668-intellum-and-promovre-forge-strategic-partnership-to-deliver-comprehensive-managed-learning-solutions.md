This collaboration addresses the critical need for businesses to deploy effective learning programs across global operations while maintaining consistent quality and operational discipline.</p><p>Promovre brings over a decade of experience as an end-to-end managed services provider, combining consulting, digital transformation, content moderation, learning and development, and technical services across global markets. Their expertise in managing operations, quality, and scale complements Intellum's platform strengths, creating a seamless solution for clients who require both a powerful learning management system and trusted execution support.</p><p>Dan Hynes, SVP of Partnerships at Intellum, emphasized the operational requirements of scalable learning. Delivering learning at scale is more than content and systems. It requires disciplined operations and managed support. By partnering with Promovre, we're giving clients not just the tools to deliver education but the operational backbone to run it effectively across geographies and functions.</p><p>Through this partnership, clients can benefit from end-to-end managed learning programs. Promovre will support everything from content creation, localization, moderation, and deployment to learning operations, governance, QA, and technical maintenance.
