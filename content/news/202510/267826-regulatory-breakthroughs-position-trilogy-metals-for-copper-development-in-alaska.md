<p>Trilogy Metals Inc. stands to benefit significantly from recent regulatory developments that could accelerate development of its copper-rich assets in Alaska. Two major policy shifts are creating more favorable conditions for the company's mining projects in the Ambler Mining District, an area recognized for its substantial copper-dominant mineral resources.</p><p>The first development involves the U.S. House of Representatives passing a resolution to overturn restrictive land designations in central Yukon, opening millions of acres previously unavailable for mineral development. This legislative action removes significant barriers to accessing mineral-rich lands that have been locked away from development for years. The second key change comes through federal executive action advancing the proposed Ambler Access Road in Northwest Alaska, a long-sought industrial corridor that Trilogy has consistently identified as essential for reaching its mining assets.</p><p>These regulatory breakthroughs come at a critical time as global demand for metals essential to clean energy and electrification continues to escalate. Copper, in particular, has become increasingly vital for renewable energy infrastructure, electric vehicles, and grid modernization projects. With government action now aligning more closely with mineral development objectives, Trilogy Metals has an opportunity to progress from exploration toward full development of its projects.</p><p>The company holds a 50% interest in Ambler Metals LLC, which maintains 100% interest in the Upper Kobuk Mineral Projects in northwestern Alaska. This partnership with South32, a globally diversified mining company that exercised its option to form a 50/50 joint venture with Trilogy in December 2019, strengthens the project's development potential. The UKMP is located within what is considered one of the richest and most prospective copper-dominant districts globally, hosting world-class polymetallic volcanogenic massive sulphide deposits containing copper, zinc, lead, gold and silver.</p><p>Exploration efforts have concentrated on two primary deposits within the Ambler Mining District: the Arctic VMS deposit and the Bornite carbonate replacement deposit. Both are situated within a land package spanning approximately 190,929 hectares. Ambler Metals has established an agreement with NANA Regional Corporation, Inc., an Alaska Native Corporation, providing a framework for exploration and potential development in cooperation with local communities. Additional information about the company's developments is available at <a href="https://ibn.fm/TMQ" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://ibn.fm/TMQ</a>.</p><p>The convergence of regulatory support and growing demand for critical minerals positions Trilogy Metals to potentially transform its Ambler Mining District projects into significant contributors to mineral security for both Alaska and the United States. As the global transition to clean energy accelerates, domestic sources of copper and other essential metals become increasingly strategic for national energy security and economic stability.</p>
