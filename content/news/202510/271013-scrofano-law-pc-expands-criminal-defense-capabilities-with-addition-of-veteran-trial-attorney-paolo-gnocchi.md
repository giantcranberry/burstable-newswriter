<p>Scrofano Law PC has expanded its Maryland criminal defense team with the addition of Attorney Paolo Gnocchi, a trilingual trial lawyer with more than 20 years of courtroom experience. Mr. Gnocchi brings a reputation for fearless advocacy and client-centered representation, having successfully defended clients in some of Maryland's most challenging criminal cases throughout his career.</p><p>Mr. Gnocchi's legal journey began at a respected Rockville law firm before he joined the Baltimore City State's Attorney's Office as an Assistant State's Attorney, where he prosecuted a broad spectrum of cases. In 2004, he shifted his focus to criminal defense, joining a boutique firm and later founding the Law Office of Paolo Gnocchi, LLC in 2009. As a solo practitioner, he represented clients in both Maryland and the District of Columbia, trying and winning hundreds of cases ranging from traffic offenses to rape and first-degree murder.</p><p>Joseph A. Scrofano, founder and principal attorney of Scrofano Law PC, emphasized the significance of this addition, stating that Mr. Gnocchi's depth of experience, community roots, and integrity perfectly align with the firm's mission to provide aggressive, compassionate representation to every client. The firm maintains offices in multiple locations, including its Maryland practice where Mr. Gnocchi will be based.</p><p>Beyond his courtroom work, Mr. Gnocchi has demonstrated a strong commitment to justice through various public service roles. He has served as a felony panel attorney with the Maryland Office of the Public Defender and as a CJA-certified attorney before the D.C. Superior Court. From 2009 to 2014, Governor Martin O'Malley appointed him to the Maryland Trial Courts Judicial Nominating Commission, reflecting his standing in the legal community. His expertise has also reached broader audiences through appearances as a legal expert on CNN Español and other media outlets.</p><p>Mr. Gnocchi's educational background includes graduating magna cum laude from Universidad del Sagrado Corazón in San Juan and earning his Juris Doctor from the Catholic University Columbus School of Law. During law school, he was appointed Chancellor of the Jessup Cup International Moot Court Team and interned with both the U.S. Department of Justice and a criminal-immigration defense firm. His professional recognition includes being featured by <a href="https://www.superlawyers.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Super Lawyers</a> and maintaining high ratings on <a href="https://www.avvo.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Avvo</a>, where former clients have described him as top notch and a terrific, caring attorney.</p><p>The addition of Mr. Gnocchi strengthens Scrofano Law PC's capacity to handle complex criminal matters across multiple jurisdictions. His fluency in English, Spanish, and Italian positions the firm to better serve diverse client populations, while his extensive trial experience enhances the firm's ability to handle serious felony cases. This move represents a significant expansion of the firm's legal talent and reinforces its commitment to providing comprehensive criminal defense services throughout the region.</p>
