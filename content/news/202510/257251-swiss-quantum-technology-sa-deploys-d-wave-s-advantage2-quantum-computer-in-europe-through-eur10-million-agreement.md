<p>Swiss Quantum Technology SA has entered into a €10 million multi-year agreement with D-Wave Quantum Inc. to deploy a D-Wave Advantage2 annealing quantum computer in Europe, representing one of the largest commercial deployments of quantum computing technology on the continent. The agreement includes an option for SQT to purchase the system outright and supports Italy's newly formed Q-Alliance initiative focused on establishing the country's leadership in quantum technologies.</p><p>The Advantage2 system features D-Wave's most advanced quantum processor with over 4,400 qubits, designed to solve complex computational problems that classical computers cannot handle efficiently. This deployment comes at a time when Europe is actively extending its quantum leadership, with D-Wave's production-grade annealing quantum computing technology positioned as a critical component for fueling quantum application development and adoption across the region.</p><p>Organizations across Europe will be able to access the system through D-Wave's Leap real-time quantum cloud service, enabling them to leverage quantum computing capabilities without significant infrastructure investment. The system's energy-efficient design makes it particularly suitable for production deployment of quantum and hybrid quantum applications, addressing both computational and sustainability concerns for enterprise users.</p><p>According to D-Wave CEO Dr. Alan Baratz, the agreement with SQT represents an important milestone in the company's ongoing effort to expand global access to its fleet of annealing quantum computers and help its rapidly growing customer base solve computationally complex problems faster and more efficiently. More information about D-Wave's quantum computing systems and services can be found at <a href="https://www.dwavequantum.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.dwavequantum.com</a>.</p><p>The placement of the SQT-funded Advantage2 system marks a significant step in making advanced quantum computing resources available to European researchers, developers, and enterprises through cloud-based access models. This deployment demonstrates growing market acceptance of quantum computing as a viable solution for complex computational challenges across industries including finance, logistics, pharmaceuticals, and materials science. The agreement represents a substantial commitment to quantum computing as a service (QCaaS) and signals increased confidence in quantum technologies as production-ready solutions for business applications.</p>
