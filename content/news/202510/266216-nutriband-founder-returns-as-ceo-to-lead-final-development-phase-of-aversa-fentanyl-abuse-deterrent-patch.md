<p>Nutriband Inc. founder Gareth Sheridan has returned to his position as chief executive officer as the company prepares for the final development phase of its flagship AVERSA Fentanyl abuse-deterrent opioid patch. The leadership transition occurs at a critical juncture in the company's 2025 development framework, which aims to culminate in a New Drug Application filing expected in 2026. Sheridan previously served as CEO before temporarily stepping aside, during which time Co-Founder and Chairman Serguei Melnik assumed the role.</p><p>The timing of Sheridan's return aligns with the company's strategic focus on advancing AVERSA Fentanyl, which represents a significant advancement in opioid safety technology designed specifically to deter misuse and prevent accidental exposure to the potent pain medication. This development comes as opioid abuse remains a major public health concern across the United States and globally, creating substantial market opportunity for safer opioid formulations.</p><p>The commercial potential for AVERSA Fentanyl is substantial, with peak annual sales projections in the United States estimated between $80 million and $200 million. These projections reflect growing demand for abuse-deterrent technologies amid increasing regulatory pressure and healthcare provider awareness about abuse prevention. The AVERSA technology platform is protected by patents in 46 countries, including major pharmaceutical markets such as the United States, Europe, and Japan, providing significant intellectual property protection for the company's innovations.</p><p>Nutriband's primary focus remains on developing transdermal pharmaceutical products, with AVERSA Fentanyl as its lead candidate. The AVERSA technology represents a versatile platform that can be incorporated into any transdermal patch to prevent abuse, misuse, diversion, and accidental exposure of drugs with abuse potential. This technology addresses a critical gap in pain management by providing healthcare providers with additional tools to balance effective pain relief with safety considerations.</p><p>The leadership transition and accelerated development timeline for AVERSA Fentanyl signal the company's commitment to bringing this important abuse-deterrent technology to market as the opioid crisis continues to demand innovative solutions from the pharmaceutical industry.
