<p>Newsworthy.ai has announced three major platform enhancements designed to make news distribution more effective, measurable, and organized. The updates include Multiple Brand Profiles & Newsrooms, Enhanced Reporting with eCPC, and a New Dashboard Experience, reinforcing the platform's position as a marketing-focused newswire built for modern digital marketing realities.</p><p>Unlike traditional press release services focused solely on media outreach, Newsworthy.ai addresses contemporary marketing needs including brand mentions, discoverability, and AI optimization. The platform publishes across hundreds of websites and indexes with Google News while transforming releases into multiple unique formats such as articles, blogs, FAQs, TLDRs, podcasts, and Zero-Click assets. Every release is structured for EEAT alignment and LLM ingestion to increase visibility in AI-powered search and generative answers.</p><p>The Multiple Brand Profiles & Newsrooms feature allows users to create unlimited brand profiles that auto-populate datelines, logos, contacts, and images for faster publishing. Each brand receives a dedicated, SEO-optimized newsroom with a custom URL at https://newsworthy.ai, centralizing all releases in one easily shareable hub that showcases brand descriptions, social media links, media kits, and agency contacts.</p><p>Enhanced Press Release Reports now include effective cost per click (eCPC), providing marketers with a clear, ROI-driven metric. With average eCPCs under $0.25 that decline toward zero as releases continue generating reads, press releases become one of the most cost-effective marketing tactics compared to ads or social boosts. The redesigned reporting dashboard offers detailed clipping reports with live links to pickup destinations and engagement metrics showing reads and shares across Newsworthy's network.</p><p>The New Dashboard Experience provides a comprehensive snapshot of all activity including press release credits, total releases by brand profile, and cumulative engagement. It tracks lifetime eCPC across all press releases, enabling marketers to quickly assess campaign cost-effectiveness.</p><p>Beyond platform upgrades, Newsworthy.ai now offers enhanced premium distribution options through https://newsramp.com, allowing users to upgrade press releases for pickup on Yahoo! News, AP News, MarketWatch, Business Insider, and more than 200 additional outlets. This combines AI-driven multi-format content creation with the credibility and visibility of placement on recognized news sites.</p><p>Mark M. Willaman, Co-founder of Newsworthy.ai, stated that these enhancements redefine press releases as a long-term, ROI-driven marketing channel. David McInnis, founder of Newsworthy.ai and founder of PRWeb, emphasized the platform's cutting-edge approach to AI optimization and content structuring for the new AI world. The platform's evolution is fueled by its proprietary amplification engine, NewsRamp.com, which extends reach into vertical and local news sites, podcasts across 38 categories, newsletters, forums, social feeds, and 12 language translations while creating unique, curated content from every press release.</p>
