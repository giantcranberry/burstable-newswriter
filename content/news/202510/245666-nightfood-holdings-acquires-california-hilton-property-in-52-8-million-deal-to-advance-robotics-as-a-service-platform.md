<p>Nightfood Holdings Inc., operating as TechForce Robotics, has completed the acquisition of Treasure Mountain Holdings, LLC, owner of the 120-room Hilton Garden Inn Rancho Mirage in California, for approximately $52.8 million. This transaction represents the company's fifth acquisition in less than two years and marks a significant step in its transformation into a technology-driven enterprise.</p><p>The acquisition supports Nightfood's strategy of integrating real estate assets with its Robotics-as-a-Service platform to create AI-connected environments for testing and deploying service robots. CEO Jimmy Chan described the purchase as another defining step toward building a vertically integrated robotics ecosystem that combines automation innovation with asset-backed stability and recurring revenue potential.</p><p>Nightfood Holdings is focused on developing and deploying AI-powered automation across industries, with hospitality serving as its initial sector of entry. The company's RaaS platform targets heavy-duty, repetitive, dirty, and injury-prone tasks that are increasingly difficult to staff with human labor. The long-term vision includes expansion into additional verticals requiring similar automation solutions, delivering scalable robotics that improve safety, efficiency, and reliability across multiple sectors.</p><p>The company's vertically integrated model includes strengthening its balance sheet through ownership of asset-rich real estate, beginning with hotel acquisitions that serve as live deployment sites for robotics testing and operational benchmarking. This combined approach of robotics innovation and real estate growth positions Nightfood to capture market share in the rapidly expanding global service robotics industry, which is projected to exceed $170 billion by 2030 globally.</p><p>Additional information about the company is available through its newsroom at <a href="https://ibn.fm/NGTF" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://ibn.fm/NGTF</a>. The acquisition of the Hilton Garden Inn Rancho Mirage represents a continuation of Nightfood's strategic expansion in the robotics and automation space, leveraging real estate assets to support technological advancement and market positioning.</p><p>For business and technology leaders, this acquisition signals a growing trend of technology companies using owned real estate as testing grounds for automation solutions. The approach provides immediate operational data and proof-of-concept validation that can accelerate commercial deployment across multiple industries. As labor shortages persist in service sectors, companies developing integrated robotics solutions with built-in testing environments may gain significant competitive advantages in scaling their technologies and demonstrating real-world effectiveness to potential enterprise clients.</p>
