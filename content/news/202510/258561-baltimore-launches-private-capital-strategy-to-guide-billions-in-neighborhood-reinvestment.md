<p>The Greater Baltimore Committee has initiated a critical phase in Baltimore's largest neighborhood reinvestment program by issuing a Request for Information to develop a private capital strategy that will direct billions of dollars toward eliminating vacant properties and community rebuilding. This effort represents the next stage in the city's historic 15-year, multi-billion-dollar vacant housing and community redevelopment initiative supported by the State of Maryland, the City of Baltimore and BUILD Baltimore, coordinated through Reinvest Baltimore established by Governor Wes Moore's 2024 Executive Order.</p><p>Mark Anthony Thomas, President and CEO of the Greater Baltimore Committee, emphasized the significance of public-private collaboration in tackling Baltimore's urban challenges. Maryland's strength has always been in its ability to bring the public and private sectors together to solve complex challenges. This is our moment to apply that same ingenuity to Baltimore's most historically disinvested neighborhoods and to design bold, practical ways to deploy, align, and administer capital so it truly drives lasting change. We're seeking great ideas and capable partners who can help us build the financial architecture that makes neighborhood reinvestment work at scale.</p><p>The RFI specifically targets investment firms, banks, Community Development Financial Institutions, philanthropies and financial experts capable of designing and managing investment vehicles that align with public funding commitments and local priorities. The selected partner or consortium will play a crucial role in developing strategies to attract and deploy private investment, strengthen disinvested neighborhoods and ensure financing approaches complement public priorities. Jennifer Vey, Executive Vice President of GBC, noted that this process will help Baltimore build the financial infrastructure to support block by block redevelopment. Our goal is to bring together civic and financial partners who understand that rebuilding Baltimore's housing market is essential to the Region's economic future.</p><p>The financial strategy outlined in the RFI includes opportunities to establish new pooled financing structures that would provide working capital loans, construction loans, rental term debt, and shared appreciation mortgages to support the redevelopment of vacant housing and surrounding communities. The full RFI and submission guidelines are available online at <a href="https://www.gbc.org" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.gbc.org</a>. Key deadlines for the RFI process include questions due by October 25, 2025, responses to questions published by November 1, 2025, and RFI submissions due by November 21, 2025. As the private-sector lead for this initiative, GBC aims to identify partner organizations that can help mobilize private and philanthropic investment aligned with public commitments, using financing strategies that reflect both market realities and community goals.</p><p>This initiative represents a significant opportunity for financial institutions and investment firms to participate in one of the nation's most ambitious urban redevelopment programs. The successful implementation of this private capital strategy could serve as a model for other cities facing similar challenges with vacant properties and neighborhood disinvestment. For business and technology leaders, the scale of this investment presents substantial opportunities in construction technology, smart city infrastructure, and community development innovations that could transform Baltimore's economic landscape for decades to come.</p>
