<p>Big Tree Cloud Holdings Limited has entered into a definitive agreement with an institutional investor for a registered direct offering of 8,064,516 ordinary shares at $0.62 per share, generating expected gross proceeds of approximately $5 million before fees and expenses. The transaction, expected to close on or about September 30, 2025, represents a significant capital infusion for the company as it continues to execute its business strategy in the competitive personal care market.</p><p>The offering is being led by Aegis Capital Corp. as exclusive placement agent, with proceeds designated for general corporate purposes and working capital. This financing comes at a time when Big Tree Cloud is positioning itself as an international capital platform focused on industrial integration and strategic investment within China's rapidly evolving personal care sector. The company's emphasis on scientific research, innovation, and technological advancement aligns with broader industry trends toward more sophisticated product development and supply chain optimization.</p><p>The $5 million capital raise provides the financial flexibility to pursue strategic objectives without the immediate pressure of generating returns, allowing for longer-term planning and investment in growth initiatives. The registered direct offering structure provides certain advantages for both the company and investors, including potentially reduced market volatility compared to traditional public offerings. For current shareholders, the dilution effect is calculated at approximately 8 million new shares entering the market, though the institutional nature of the investment suggests confidence in the company's direction and prospects.</p><p>This capital raise occurs within a broader context of increasing investment in China's personal care industry, which has seen substantial growth driven by rising consumer disposable income and heightened focus on personal grooming and wellness. The timing of the offering, scheduled for completion in late 2025, provides Big Tree Cloud with substantial runway to deploy capital strategically while navigating market conditions. The company's commitment to promoting globalization of Chinese personal care brands reflects broader national economic priorities while addressing specific industry challenges related to international market penetration and brand recognition.</p><p>Additional information about the company and its operations can be found at <a href="https://www.bigtreecloud.net/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.bigtreecloud.net/</a> while details of the offering are available through the full press release at <a href="https://ibn.fm/zDqOy" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://ibn.fm/zDqOy</a>. The company's approach centers on leveraging supply chain synergy and efficiency improvement, critical factors in an industry where production costs and operational effectiveness significantly impact market positioning.</p>
