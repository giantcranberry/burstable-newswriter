<p>The Capital Debt Affordability Committee has recommended the state proceed with borrowing up to $1.75 billion for capital projects in the upcoming fiscal year, maintaining a debt level established two years ago despite potential economic challenges from federal government shutdowns and worker layoffs. The unanimous recommendation, delivered Thursday, supports continued investment in critical infrastructure priorities while aligning with the state's existing financial planning.</p><p>Acting Budget Secretary Marc Nicole emphasized that maintaining the $1.75 billion borrowing level is essential for advancing key state initiatives. "Maintaining the current level of debt at the $1.75 billion will enable the state to continue to make progress on priority capital needs, including school construction, economic development, housing affordability and replacement of state-owned facilities," Nicole stated. He further warned that "recommending any less than $1.75 billion will hamper our progress on these critical investments."</p><p>The committee's approval process was notably efficient, taking less than 10 minutes to reach consensus. While the recommendation is not binding on either the governor or the legislature, it is expected to face minimal opposition as it represents a continuation of the capital spending increase originally approved by the panel two years ago. This consistency in financial planning provides stability for ongoing and planned infrastructure projects across multiple sectors.</p><p>Nicole addressed potential concerns about the state's credit rating, noting that maintaining the established borrowing level should not raise significant issues with bond rating agencies. "Maintaining the level at $1.75 billion should not raise significant concerns for the two bond rating agencies that are continuing to rate us AAA, as we are matching our prior year plans," he explained. The state's AAA rating from major bond agencies reflects strong financial management and provides favorable borrowing terms for taxpayers.</p><p>The recommended bond issuance comes at a time when federal fiscal uncertainties could create economic headwinds, making the state's commitment to infrastructure investment particularly significant. By proceeding with the planned borrowing, the state demonstrates confidence in its financial position and commitment to long-term capital projects that support education, economic growth, and community development.
