<p>Ace Green Recycling, a U.S.-based green recycling technology company, has developed proprietary technologies to sustainably recycle both lead-acid and lithium-ion batteries through fully electrified processes that produce zero Scope 1 carbon emissions, zero toxic water, and zero solid waste. The company's modular, scalable design allows deployment across different geographies, enabling countries to retain valuable resources domestically rather than exporting waste and reimporting refined materials.</p><p>CEO Nishchay Chadha founded Ace after witnessing unsafe and environmentally harmful recycling practices firsthand during a visit to a recycling plant in Vietnam where children worked in toxic conditions and waste was dumped into open drains. This experience inspired him to prove that recycling could be both profitable and sustainable. Chadha identified a market gap for a global platform combining technology, financing, and risk management in what was otherwise a fragmented industry.</p><p>The company operates two core technology platforms: GREENLEAD® for lead-acid battery recycling and LithiumFirst for lithium-ion battery recycling. GREENLEAD® replaces legacy smelting with a cleaner hydrometallurgical approach that recovers up to 99% of battery-grade lead with more than 99.98% purity. LithiumFirst can recover up to 80% of lithium at >99% purity from lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries, positioning the company advantageously as LFP batteries are projected to become the dominant chemistry by 2030.</p><p>A key innovation is the Grid Metallics Processing System (GMPS), which replaces smelting for lead-acid batteries by separating and individually processing components using proprietary mechanical and chemical methods. The recovered metallics are then melted to form battery-grade lead alloy ingots without the toxic emissions associated with smelting. This system integrates with GREENLEAD® to create a fully zero-emission solution that is faster, cleaner, and more cost-efficient than conventional methods.</p><p>The company is developing a flagship recycling facility in Texas scheduled to begin operations in 2026. The facility will process both lead-acid and lithium-ion batteries and serve as a model for North American expansion, supporting domestic clean energy and electric vehicle goals. Strategic partnerships are central to Ace's business model, including a recent collaboration with <a href="https://spiro.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Spiro</a>, Africa's largest electric vehicle company, which selected Ace as its exclusive global recycling partner. The company also has a long-term offtake agreement with <a href="https://glencore.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Glencore</a> to support materials recovered from Texas operations.</p><p>Ace is currently moving from development to large-scale execution, with licensing deployments across Armenia, Thailand, and India, while scaling up lithium-ion recycling operations in India and expanding non-smelting lead recycling worldwide. The company's approach demonstrates that industrial recycling can be profitable and sustainable without relying on furnaces or toxic emissions, bringing the industry closer to closing the loop on critical minerals and powering the clean-energy transition responsibly.</p>
