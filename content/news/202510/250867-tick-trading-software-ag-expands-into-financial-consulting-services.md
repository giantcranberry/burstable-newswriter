<p>Tick Trading Software AG is expanding its service portfolio to include consulting services for companies in the financial sector, broadening its strategic focus and creating additional value for customers. The company, which has built a strong reputation in software development for securities trading and settlement over many years, is now building on this foundation with an additional line of business.</p><p>New CEO Martin Luttich, who joined tick-TS AG on October 1, 2025, after his career at HSBC Germany, explained the strategic move. The framework conditions in the financial industry are constantly changing and repeatedly present companies with new challenges. With its many years of industry experience, our team can deliver real added value in analyzing and overcoming these challenges, Luttich stated.</p><p>The new consulting unit will support companies in addressing technological and process-related challenges, focusing on practical business analysis and project support along the entire value chain in the securities sector. The consulting services extend beyond support and optimization of tick Trading Software AG's own products to cover a wide range of topics including customized project support for third-party software integration and business process optimization, particularly for regulatory compliance.</p><p>To launch the consulting division, two new colleagues with extensive experience in business analysis and complex project management have joined the team. Both hold doctorates in physics and previously worked at a major European bank, bringing substantial consulting expertise and deep technical understanding of securities business, regulatory requirements, and information technology.</p><p>With this expansion, tick Trading Software AG aims to strengthen its market position long-term and actively shape the financial sector through tailored software solutions and consulting services. The company has been providing professional customers with its <a href="https://www.tick-trading.com/tradebase-mx" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">TradeBase MX platform</a> for more than 20 years, which represents one of the world's most advanced and reliable trading platforms. The product portfolio includes direct connections to national and international marketplaces and brokers, market making tools for designated sponsoring, proprietary hosting infrastructure, and the e-Trading Compliance Monitor for ESMA regulation compliance.</p><p>This strategic expansion into consulting services represents a significant shift for the financial technology sector, where specialized software providers are increasingly offering comprehensive business solutions rather than just technical products. For financial institutions, this means access to integrated expertise that combines deep technical knowledge with practical business understanding, potentially reducing the complexity of managing multiple vendors for software implementation and business consulting services.</p><p>The move comes at a time when financial institutions face increasing regulatory pressures and technological transformation requirements, making integrated solutions particularly valuable. Tick Trading Software AG has been listed on the primary market of the Dusseldorf Stock Exchange since 2017 and is available on many other trading venues. The company maintains its commitment to paying the entire distributable net profit as dividends to investors, as stipulated in its Articles of Association.</p>
