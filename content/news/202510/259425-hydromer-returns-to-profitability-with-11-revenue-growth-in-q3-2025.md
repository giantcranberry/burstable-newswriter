<p>Hydromer, Inc. (OTC: HYDI) reported preliminary unaudited financial results for the quarter ended September 30, 2025, showing an 11% revenue increase to $0.91 million compared to $0.81 million in the same period of 2024. The medical device coating specialist also achieved a net income of $53,000, marking a significant return to profitability after previous challenging quarters. This performance reflects the company's continued market position in surface modification technologies and suggests potential stability in its business model.</p><p>CEO Michael Torti attributed the positive results to strong customer loyalty and emerging growth from new customers entering the company's production coating line-up. The company's focus on operational efficiency and strategic customer partnerships appears to be yielding tangible financial benefits. Hydromer maintains its commitment to building a scalable, innovation-driven platform while continuing to invest in infrastructure and equipment needs alongside new product development initiatives.</p><p>Despite the positive financial performance, management expressed concerns about the artificially low valuation of HYDI stock and associated trading difficulties. In response, the company plans to return the stock to the OTCID Basic Market to address these challenges. This strategic move could potentially improve market accessibility and valuation metrics for investors monitoring the medical technology sector.</p><p>The company's 44-year industry presence and certification as an ISO 9001:2015 company with facilities compliant to Good Manufacturing Practice and ISO 13485 standards provide additional credibility to its operational capabilities. The original release can be viewed on <a href="https://www.newmediawire.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.newmediawire.com</a> for additional context. However, investors should note that these preliminary results remain subject to completion of the company's 2025 year-end financial reporting processes, reviews, audit, and potential adjustments.</p><p>For business leaders and technology investors, Hydromer's performance signals potential opportunities in the specialized medical device coating market. The company's ability to return to profitability while maintaining revenue growth during a period of ongoing investment in technology development demonstrates operational discipline. The planned stock market transition and continued focus on innovation will be critical factors to monitor in coming quarters as the company positions itself for sustained growth in the competitive medical technology landscape.</p>
