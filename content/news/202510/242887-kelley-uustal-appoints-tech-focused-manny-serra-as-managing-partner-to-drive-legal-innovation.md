<p>Kelley | Uustal, recognized as one of the nation's premier plaintiff trial firms, has appointed Manny Serra as Managing Partner. Founder John Uustal explained that Serra's appointment will help ensure the firm's track record of securing precedent-setting verdicts and life-changing outcomes continues to be matched by technology, infrastructure, and modern leadership at the pinnacle of trial law.</p><p>Serra brings extensive litigation experience to his new role, having litigated more than 1,500 cases and conducted over 30 jury trials. His career began at the Broward County Public Defender's Office, where he became known for policing the police and earned the nickname Motion Manny from judges. His perspective on the legal system shifted significantly during his work in first-party property litigation, where he witnessed how large insurers systematically underpaid claims and treated people as case files rather than human beings.</p><p>People who find themselves in our legal system deserve no stone left unturned in the quest for justice. There are no shortcuts, Serra said about his approach to legal practice. This conviction has driven his focus on delivering personalized, client-centered justice through technology, including teaching other attorneys how to use artificial intelligence in practice management and law firm operations.</p><p>Tech is not about taking people out of the picture; it's about centering the person. I believe the best way to humanize the practice of law is to systematize it for the client's best interest, Serra explained. His philosophy represents a significant shift in how technology is viewed within the legal profession, moving beyond efficiency metrics to focus on improving client outcomes and experiences.</p><p>At Kelley | Uustal, Serra sees his role as ensuring the team can stay entirely focused on getting extraordinary results for clients across the country while he oversees the systems and innovation that sustain the firm's success. The firm, which specializes in catastrophic injury, wrongful death, and complex commercial litigation, has secured more than $1 billion in life-changing verdicts and settlements for clients nationwide. Additional information about the firm's practice areas and attorney profiles can be found at <a href="https://kelleyuustal.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://kelleyuustal.com</a>.</p><p>Prior to joining Kelley | Uustal, Serra served as managing partner of a trial firm based in Fort Lauderdale. His professional recognitions include selection by the National Trial Lawyers Association in Top 40 Trial Lawyers Under 40, Florida Super Lawyers, Lawyers of Distinction, and the National Association of Distinguished Counsel.</p><p>The appointment signals Kelley | Uustal's commitment to integrating advanced technology and modern management practices while maintaining its core mission of achieving justice for clients through high-stakes litigation. Serra's unique combination of extensive trial experience and technological expertise positions the firm to navigate the evolving landscape of legal practice while continuing its tradition of securing landmark verdicts and settlements.</p>
