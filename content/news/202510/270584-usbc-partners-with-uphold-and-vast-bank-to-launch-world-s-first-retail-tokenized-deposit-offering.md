<p>USBC, Inc. has announced a preliminary partnership with Uphold and nationally-chartered Vast Bank to introduce the world's first retail tokenized deposit offering, marking a significant advancement in digital finance. The collaboration will provide global access to U.S. dollar-denominated tokenized deposits and U.S. dollar deposit accounts for individuals, enterprises, and financial institutions worldwide.</p><p>Beginning in 2026, Uphold's customers will be able to open U.S. dollar deposit accounts enabling them to hold and transfer digital representations of their U.S. dollar deposits at Vast Bank on USBC's privacy-preserving blockchain. Enabled by Vast Bank's national charter and compliance framework, USBC tokenized deposits are designed to enable the underlying deposit to be eligible for FDIC insurance in accordance with applicable limits and requirements and subject to Reg E protections.</p><p>USBC Chairman and CEO Greg Kidd, the lead architect of the company's blockchain banking vision, stated that the announcement marks a defining moment for both USBC and the future of digital dollars. By combining the regulatory strength of the national bank charter with the scalability and accessibility of blockchain technology, the partnership positions USBC at the forefront of digital finance, building a transformative pathway to move money around the world in a fully compliant and regulated environment.</p><p>Unlike stablecoins, which are synthetic and lack meaningful consumer protections, USBC tokenized deposits are on-chain, digital representations of real U.S. dollars and are issued by a bank regulated under U.S. law. The breakthrough product offers three key advantages over other digital dollar initiatives: unparalleled safety with FDIC insurance eligibility, regulatory confidence through compliance with U.S. financial regulations, and programmable finance enabling instant settlement, real-time international payments, and smart contract automation.</p><p>Accompanying the partnership announcement, USBC has published a whitepaper outlining its vision for tokenized deposits available at <a href="http://usbc.xyz/i/whitepaper" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://usbc.xyz/i/whitepaper</a>. The partnership is expected to accelerate revenue by driving deposit volume into Vast Bank and deepen engagement with both retail and institutional clients through Uphold's global platform at <a href="https://uphold.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://uphold.com</a>.</p><p>The initiative opens vast new markets for U.S. bank accounts and strengthens USBC's strategic position as a category-defining leader. As the network operator, USBC's revenue model is highly scalable with the support of existing infrastructure. The partnership also solidifies USBC's regulatory leadership by setting the industry template for compliant, scalable digital money, offering a framework for other U.S. banks to safely enter the tokenized deposit market through Vast Bank's platform at <a href="https://www.vast.bank" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.vast.bank</a>.</p><p>Uphold, Vast and USBC have entered into a non-binding Memorandum of Understanding to finalize the terms of their strategic partnership in a definitive agreement. The MOU reflects a shared intent to finalize the terms during the fourth quarter of 2025, with the final agreement being subject to requisite board and regulatory approvals. The infrastructure is built to be scalable, inviting future potential for additional financial institutions to leverage this blueprint for secure, on-chain bank operations.</p>
