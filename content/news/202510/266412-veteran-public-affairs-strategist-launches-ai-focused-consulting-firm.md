<p>Damian O'Doherty has launched O'Doherty & Associates, marking his departure from KO Public Affairs after 17 years as co-founder. The new venture represents a strategic pivot toward addressing how artificial intelligence is fundamentally reshaping influence operations across multiple sectors. O'Doherty stated that after nearly two decades building KO Public Affairs, the public affairs landscape has transformed, requiring new approaches and capabilities.</p><p>The firm positions itself as a family of firms spanning Maryland, Washington, D.C., and Colorado with global operations. This structure includes a Maryland-based law practice, an Aspen influence and public affairs agency, and a global capital network. Among its core offerings is Health Counsel, which advises healthcare executives on policy and strategy matters. The integrated approach reflects O'Doherty's recognition that traditional public affairs methods may be insufficient in an AI-driven environment where communication, policy, and strategy intersect in novel ways.</p><p>O'Doherty brings extensive experience from shaping some of the region's most visible projects, including healthcare advocacy, infrastructure expansion, and economic development around the Port of Baltimore and D.C. Beltway. His background as an early investor in MGM National Harbor and his work on affordable housing initiatives for firefighters in Aspen provides him with deep insight into the evolving demands of modern leadership. This experience positions the new firm to understand how influence operates across diverse sectors from statehouses and health systems to data centers and global markets.</p><p>The firm's launch signals a broader industry recognition that artificial intelligence requires new consulting approaches. O'Doherty emphasized that today's public affairs landscape demands new tools, sharper instincts, and a broader canvas than what traditional methods provide. He described the transition by noting that the boxing gloves that built KO Public Affairs don't fit what's next in the field. The announcement appeared first on <a href="https://citybiz.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://citybiz.com</a>, highlighting the business implications of this strategic shift.</p><p>For business and technology leaders, O'Doherty & Associates represents the growing specialization required to navigate the complex intersection of artificial intelligence, policy development, and strategic influence. The firm aims to help leaders, institutions, and innovators gain resonance in what O'Doherty terms the AI epoch, combining expertise in law, influence, media, and capital strategy. This approach acknowledges that AI is not merely another tool but is fundamentally reshaping how influence operates across all sectors and geographic regions.</p><p>The creation of O'Doherty & Associates responds to the increasing need for counsel that can bridge technological transformation with traditional influence operations. As O'Doherty stated, firms must be fit to fight for a new future, and this next round starts now. The venture's global reach and multi-disciplinary structure reflect the borderless nature of AI's impact on public affairs and the requirement for integrated solutions that span legal, strategic, and capital considerations.</p>
