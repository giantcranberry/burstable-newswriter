<p>A recent survey of 1,500 U.S. women aged 18 to 50 reveals that safety concerns significantly impact daily life, with 67% of respondents identifying walking alone at night as their primary fear. The survey, conducted by independent research firm Talker on behalf of LogicMark Inc., found that safety anxieties have become deeply embedded in women's routines, particularly after sunset. According to LogicMark CEO Chia-Lin Simmons, "These findings expose a critical reality that can no longer be ignored. Women are living with pervasive anxiety that significantly impacts and reshapes their daily lives."</p><p>The data shows that 38% of women reported safety concerns that actively affect their daily activities, with 13% experiencing significant limitations and 25% somewhat restricting their movements and choices. Additionally, 32% of respondents have encountered situations where they felt unsafe but were unable to contact someone for help, with another 26% facing this scenario multiple times. "As a result, they're increasingly turning to technology for defense, protection and peace of mind," Simmons noted.</p><p>Traditional safety measures like pepper spray and location devices are becoming inadequate, according to the survey results. Women overwhelmingly expressed preference for safety devices that are either completely invisible or disguised as jewelry and accessories, with 71% favoring discreet options. Respondents also emphasized the need for devices capable of contacting authorities and family members during emergencies. This growing demand aligns with projections that the global personal security app market will reach $2.45 billion by the end of 2032, growing at a compound annual growth rate of 14%.</p><p>LogicMark addresses these needs with Aster, an app that transforms smartphones into 24/7 personal safety monitoring devices available on both iPhone and Android platforms. The Aster app provides four methods for obtaining help: an emergency button, a home screen slider for quick access to emergency services, a 'Hold Until Safe' button to arm the app, and the 'Follow-Me' feature for scheduling alerts and check-ins. Once activated, the app requires a PIN to cancel if the threat diminishes, automatically alerting emergency services and dispatching them to the phone's GPS location. Users can add trusted followers for check-ins and schedule events that alert followers if they fail to check in on time.</p><p>For situations where phones aren't accessible, LogicMark offers a complementary emergency button that clips to purses, keychains, or backpack straps. The compact device, no larger than an AirTag, calls for help with three presses and connects users to a 24/7 monitoring service that remains on the line until safety is confirmed. The button features a five-month battery life and works in conjunction with the Aster app as a quick-access emergency device. This technology responds to survey findings showing that 70% of women use mobile devices to keep friends and family informed of their whereabouts, with 50% actively sharing their location through smartphones and apps.</p><p>The digital-first approach to personal safety proves particularly popular among younger women aged 18-25, with 62% using location-sharing apps compared to 41% of women aged 36-50. Simmons emphasized that "As a company dedicated to personal safety solutions, we are on a mission to develop innovative devices that meet evolving needs for discretion, connectivity, and reliable emergency response. Beyond technology, we must also advocate for systemic changes that address the root causes forcing women to live in fear. Every safety concern revealed in this survey represents a call to action for our entire society."</p>
