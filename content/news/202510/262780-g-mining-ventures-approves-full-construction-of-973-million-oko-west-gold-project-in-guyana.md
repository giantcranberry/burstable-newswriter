<p>G Mining Ventures Corp. has announced that its Board of Directors has approved full construction of the company's 100%-owned Oko West Gold Project in Guyana following the completion of permitting and financing milestones. The $973 million initial capital investment represents a crucial step in GMIN's evolution toward becoming an intermediate gold producer, demonstrating the company's capability to advance major mining projects through the development pipeline.</p><p>Detailed engineering for the project is currently 36% complete, with procurement commitments reaching $334 million, representing approximately 33% of the total budget. Early construction works are advancing according to schedule, positioning the project for continued progress toward its operational timeline. The company has targeted the second half of 2027 for first gold production from the Oko West project, reflecting the comprehensive development plan that GMIN has implemented.</p><p>Louis-Pierre Gignac, President and CEO of G Mining Ventures, emphasized that the official launch of construction at Oko West marks a major milestone in the company's evolution. He noted that with financing secured, the company is advancing this world-class project using the same disciplined, self-perform approach that successfully delivered the Tocantinzinho project safely, on time and within budget. This track record suggests potential for efficient execution and cost control in a sector often challenged by budget overruns and delays.</p><p>The project represents one of the significant gold development initiatives currently underway in the mining-friendly jurisdiction of Guyana. The approval of full construction follows the company's successful navigation of critical permitting and financing requirements, demonstrating GMIN's operational maturity and project advancement capabilities. The Oko West Gold Project now joins the company's TZ Gold Mine in Brazil as cornerstone assets in GMIN's portfolio, supporting the company's strategic growth objectives in the precious metals sector.</p><p>For business and technology leaders monitoring the mining sector, this development signals continued investment in gold production capacity amid ongoing global economic uncertainty and inflation concerns. The successful advancement of such large-scale projects could influence investor confidence in junior mining companies' ability to execute complex development plans.
