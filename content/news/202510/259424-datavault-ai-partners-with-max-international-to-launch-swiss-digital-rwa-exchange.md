<p>Datavault AI has formed a strategic partnership with Max International AG to establish and operate a Switzerland-based Swiss Digital RWA Exchange. This collaboration utilizes Switzerland's sophisticated digital regulatory framework, which hosts SIX Digital Exchange as NASDAQ's technological partner, to accelerate institutional acceptance of Real World Assets by overcoming regulatory, scalability, and fiduciary obstacles.</p><p>The exchange will function as the underlying infrastructure for Datavault AI's International Elements and NIL Exchanges, facilitating the tokenization of commodities and rights. This capability is reinforced by the company's worldwide patent portfolio for secure data tokenization and automated compliance systems. The initiative marks a substantial advancement in connecting conventional financial markets with developing digital asset technologies.</p><p>Datavault AI's comprehensive technology suite provides end-to-end solutions for experiential data perception, valuation, and secure monetization via its cloud-based platform. The Information Data Exchange supports Digital Twins and name, image, and likeness licensing by securely linking physical real-world objects to immutable metadata objects, promoting responsible AI implementation with integrity. Additional information about the company's technology platform is available at <a href="https://www.datavaultsite.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.datavaultsite.com</a>.</p><p>The partnership benefits from Switzerland's standing as a global financial center with forward-thinking digital asset regulations. The nation's regulatory structure offers the essential framework for institutional investors to engage confidently in digital asset markets while adhering to international compliance standards. Further details about the partnership and exchange development can be accessed in the complete press release at <a href="https://ibn.fm/0hxfr" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://ibn.fm/0hxfr</a>.</p><p>This development emerges as institutional interest in real world asset tokenization expands rapidly across diverse sectors including sports and entertainment, events and venues, biotech, education, fintech, real estate, healthcare, and energy. The technology creates new possibilities for asset liquidity and fractional ownership that were previously inaccessible through traditional financial systems, potentially transforming how institutions manage and monetize physical assets in digital formats.</p>
