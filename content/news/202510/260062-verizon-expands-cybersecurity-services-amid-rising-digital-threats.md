<p>Verizon is expanding its cybersecurity portfolio with new home protection services and enhanced mobile security tools during Cybersecurity Awareness Month, responding to escalating digital threats facing consumers. The telecommunications provider introduced Digital Secure Home, a service designed to safeguard home networks from online vulnerabilities, while simultaneously refreshing its Verizon Protect mobile application with new security assessment capabilities.</p><p>Che Phillip, Senior Vice President of Consumer Device Marketing at Verizon, emphasized the company's security commitment, noting that securing customer connections remains central to Verizon's promise. This initiative aligns with findings from the 2025 Verizon Data Breach Investigations Report, which documented a 34% increase in vulnerability exploitation as an initial access vector for breaches compared to the previous year.</p><p>The new Digital Secure Home service offers two protection tiers for home networks. The entry-level version, included at no additional cost with Fios Home Internet service, provides vulnerability assessments and malicious website protection. For enhanced security, Digital Secure Home Plus offers advanced protection against botnet and brute force attacks, abnormal device behavior detection, and sensitive data safeguarding for router-connected devices at $5.99 monthly. Both services are managed through the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Verizon Home app</a>, available for download from Google Play and Apple's App Store.</p><p>Concurrently, Verizon has updated its Verizon Protect mobile application with features providing customers deeper insight into their digital security. The refreshed app now includes a Security Rating system delivering dynamic personal data security scores with personalized improvement insights. Security Categories enable users to evaluate protection across four key areas: Identity, Device, Network, and Online security, with recommended actions to address vulnerabilities in each category.</p><p>During the Fall Open Enrollment period running through November 3, Verizon is promoting its Verizon Mobile Protect service, offering comprehensive device coverage against loss, theft, damage, and post-warranty malfunctions. The protection plan includes unlimited claims, unlimited cracked screen repairs without additional costs, 24/7 premium tech support, and same-day device delivery and setup in select cases.</p><p>These expanded cybersecurity offerings represent Verizon's strategic pivot toward providing services beyond traditional network connectivity, positioning the company as a comprehensive digital protection provider for modern consumers confronting increasingly sophisticated cyber threats. The services address security challenges arising from the proliferation of connected devices in typical households and the corresponding expansion of potential attack surfaces for cybercriminals.</p>
