Moore has also held senior advisory roles in the Biden Harris Administration and served as CEO of the Democratic National Committee.</p><p>The board additions mark a defining step in One World Products' transition to Isiah Enterprises as the company broadens its focus to automotive sustainability, renewable materials, and circular economy manufacturing. Recent operational milestones include the successful launch and scaling of a rubber compounds product line using existing equipment, with more than 100,000 pounds shipped to date.
