<p>The 27th Hong Kong International Lighting Fair (Autumn Edition) and 10th Hong Kong International Outdoor and Tech Light Expo have united approximately 3,000 exhibitors from 20 countries and regions, highlighting the rapid evolution of lighting technology toward smarter, more human-centric applications. Organized by the Hong Kong Trade Development Council (HKTDC), these concurrent events demonstrate how lighting is transitioning from simple illumination to integrated systems that enhance health, sustainability, and urban functionality.</p><p>Jenny Koo, Deputy Executive Director of HKTDC, emphasized the sector's growth potential, noting that under the theme "Illuminated Designs for a Smarter Future," the fairs showcase innovative products and smart lighting solutions from diverse international markets including Denmark, Finland, Germany, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The Hall of Connected Lighting serves as the event's centerpiece, featuring 70 leading brands and specially designed experience zones that immerse visitors in multi-dimensional light installations blending art and technology.</p><p>Major industry alliances including the DALI Alliance, SILA-EMN Alliance, Connectivity Standards Alliance, and Zhaga Consortium are presenting the full spectrum of the smart lighting ecosystem. These organizations bring together member enterprises from around the world, showcasing how interconnected systems are revolutionizing lighting applications. The smart lighting market's significance is underscored by Statista projections indicating it will reach $44 billion by 2030, reflecting growing consumer demand for customizable lighting solutions.</p><p>Human-centric lighting emerges as a dominant trend, with health-focused innovations taking center stage. Signify unveiled its VitaUp Vitamin D3 Modules by Philips, offering controlled UVB exposure to support healthy vitamin D levels, while Jiangsu Insona Communication Technology Co. presented a smart lighting system using circadian algorithms synchronized with local sunrise and sunset times without requiring network connectivity. Foshan Electrical and Lighting Co. launched its Eye-care Ceiling Light specifically designed for elderly users, improving visual clarity by 15% and supporting circadian rhythms.</p><p>The Outdoor and Tech Light Expo showcases solutions enabling smart city development, particularly through the returning Smart Pole and Solution Zone. E-Lite Semiconductor Inc. demonstrates smart light poles equipped with energy-efficient LED lighting and environmental sensing technology that monitors air quality, temperature, humidity, and noise levels while assisting with real-time traffic monitoring. Shenzhen Zhongchuang Lighting Technology presents patented modular square stadium lights in the Technical & Professional Lighting zone, featuring individual module replacement capabilities that simplify installation and reduce operational costs.</p><p>Immersive experiences allow buyers to interact with cutting-edge technologies firsthand. Casambi created the Artisan Caf√©, a boutique coffee space illuminated in collaboration with globally acclaimed architectural lighting brand ERCO, featuring lighting configured to simulate natural light at different times of day. TUYA Smart constructed living room and bedroom scenes demonstrating how lighting and AI technologies integrate into comprehensive smart lighting solutions. Moorgen presents cross-over collections from global design masters, including smart lamps developed in collaboration with award-winning designers Chi-wing Lo and Tino Kwan, architect Steve Leung, Spanish designer Jorge Herrera, and design studio Yabu Pushelberg.</p><p>Educational components include the Innovative Lighting Design Forum exploring "City Design.Design City: Lighting Design Bound Up with Daily Life" and "RCEP Opportunities Shining Through Cultural Lighting Design." The Connected Lighting Forum delves into smart living ecosystems and sustainable lighting development, while renowned lighting designer Tino Kwan hosts a masterclass titled "The Language of Light: From Artistic Design to Everyday Experience," sharing design principles for enhancing daily life through lighting. Additional seminars focus on outdoor lighting designs integrating sustainability concepts, reflecting the industry's commitment to environmental responsibility.</p><p>Under the EXHIBITION+ hybrid model, the fairs extend their reach through the <a href="https://click2match.hktdc.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Click2Match business matching platform</a>, running from October 20 to November 7, facilitating connections between exhibitors and buyers both online and offline.
