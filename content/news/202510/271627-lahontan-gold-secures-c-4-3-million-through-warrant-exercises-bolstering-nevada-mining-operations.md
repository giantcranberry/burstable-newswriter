<p>Lahontan Gold Corp. has received C$4,316,948 from the exercise of warrants and stock options between July 4 and October 23, 2025, resulting in 334,420,221 common shares outstanding. The substantial capital infusion will fund exploration and mine development at the company's Nevada projects, including the Santa Fe and West Santa Fe sites located in the prolific Walker Lane gold belt.</p><p>Chief Executive Officer Kimberly Ann stated that the warrant and option exercises demonstrate strong shareholder confidence in the company's direction and prospects. The proceeds leave Lahontan fully financed for its fall drilling programs while simultaneously tightening the company's share structure to support future growth initiatives. This financial strengthening comes at a critical time as the company advances its flagship Santa Fe Mine project toward production.</p><p>The Santa Fe Mine project spans 26.4 square kilometers and has a significant production history, having yielded 359,202 ounces of gold and 702,067 ounces of silver between 1988 and 1995 from open pit mines utilizing heap-leach processing. According to the company's technical disclosure, the property contains a Canadian National Instrument 43-101 compliant Indicated Mineral Resource of 1,539,000 ounces of gold equivalent and an Inferred Mineral Resource of 411,000 ounces of gold equivalent, all pit constrained.</p><p>The company's technical content has been reviewed and approved by Michael Lindholm, CPG, Independent Consulting Geologist to Lahontan Gold Corp., who is a Qualified Person as defined in National Instrument 43-101. Additional technical details are available in the <a href="https://lahontangoldcorp.com/technical-reports" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Preliminary Economic Assessment, NI 43-101 Technical Report, Santa Fe Project</a> dated January 24, 2025. The company plans to continue advancing the Santa Fe Mine project towards production, update the Santa Fe Preliminary Economic Assessment, and drill test its satellite West Santa Fe project during 2025.</p><p>This financial development positions Lahontan Gold to aggressively pursue its exploration and development objectives in one of North America's most productive mining jurisdictions. The Walker Lane belt has historically been a significant gold-producing region, and the company's properties represent substantial untapped potential. The warrant exercises not only provide immediate funding but also reflect market confidence in the company's strategic direction and the underlying value of its mineral assets.</p><p>The capital injection comes as the company prepares for intensive exploration activities, with the tightened share structure potentially enhancing shareholder value through reduced dilution. The combination of historical production, established resources, and renewed financial backing creates a strong foundation for Lahontan's continued growth in the competitive precious metals sector.
