<p>Marcos Acuña, CEO of QU!CK Scan&CO, has been featured on the cover of Hispanic Target Magazine as one of its Top Hispanic Entrepreneurs during Hispanic Heritage Month. The recognition celebrates Acuña's innovative vision and leadership in reshaping fast, employee-free customer service worldwide through his Argentine-born company. This acknowledgment comes at a pivotal moment as the company expands its operations into the United States market, beginning with strategic locations in Miami.</p><p>Acuña recently arrived in Miami with his family, selecting the city as the starting point for QU!CK Scan&CO's U.S. expansion. The company's disruptive business model offers a fully automated customer service experience that eliminates the need for employees through cutting-edge technology and simplified processes. Miami's vibrant, multicultural environment that embraces innovation made it the ideal location for this expansion, according to Acuña. The company's approach focuses on eliminating customer wait times while placing technology at the center of the service experience, addressing modern consumers' demand for fast, reliable solutions without delays.</p><p>QU!CK Scan&CO currently operates in more than 50 retail and business locations across different countries and has already established successful operations in several parts of Miami-Dade and Broward. The recognition from Hispanic Target Magazine not only highlights the company's global momentum but also underscores the increasing influence of Latino entrepreneurship in the U.S. market. Acuña's hands-on leadership style and strong family presence reflect his personal commitment to the business, with his family's involvement being essential to the project's success.</p><p>The implications of QU!CK Scan&CO's expansion and recognition extend beyond individual achievement to broader industry transformation. As businesses worldwide grapple with labor shortages and rising operational costs, the company's employee-free model presents a scalable alternative that could reshape customer service standards across multiple sectors. For technology leaders and business executives, this represents both a competitive threat and an opportunity to adopt similar automation strategies to improve efficiency and reduce overhead.</p><p>Acuña aims to inspire other Hispanic entrepreneurs to pursue ambitious goals and take bold business steps, viewing the enterprise as both a business venture and personal mission to create a future where speed and quality coexist in customer service. The company's success in international markets and now in the competitive U.S. landscape demonstrates the viability of technology-driven service models that prioritize customer experience while optimizing operational costs. This recognition during Hispanic Heritage Month particularly highlights the growing contribution of Latino-led innovation to the American business ecosystem.</p>
