<p>Opawica Explorations Inc. has identified a substantial conceptual exploration target at its Bazooka Property located along the Cadillac-Larder Lake Break, one of the world's most productive gold-bearing geological structures. The company is exploring for a target ranging from 10 to 40 million tonnes grading between 0.9 to 1.45 grams per tonne gold, based on current geological understanding and historical drilling data.</p><p>The Bazooka Property's strategic positioning adjacent to Yamana Gold's Wasamac Project places it within a district actively explored by major producers including Agnico Eagle Mines. This region continues to demonstrate significant potential for high-grade gold discoveries, with the conceptual target representing a substantial opportunity for resource development. The exploration target remains conceptual in nature, and there has not been sufficient drilling to define a mineral resource, with current drill spacing too limited to classify any portion as an Inferred Mineral Resource.</p><p>Geological analysis reveals the Cadillac-Larder Lake Break at Bazooka features a 20-60 meter wide deformation corridor with intense alteration including carbonate, silica, fuchsite, and tourmaline. Historical drilling data from 210 drill holes totaling 51,219 meters shows several high-grade intercepts that confirm the presence of sulphide-bearing quartz veins with visible gold. Notable intercepts include 77.18 g/t over 5.79 meters, 25.77 g/t over 7.5 meters, and 11.46 g/t over 11.20 meters, all hosted within intensely altered zones of the Main Zone.</p><p>The mineralization occurs within a 60-meter-wide zone of quartz-carbonate-sericite and talc-chlorite schists, spatially associated with a strongly graphitic fault marking the contact between sedimentary and ultramafic metavolcanic rocks. The Abitibi greenstone belt, where the property is located, represents the largest Archean greenstone belt globally and contains significant endowments of silver, copper, zinc and lesser quantities of lithium, nickel, cobalt, platinum, palladium and molybdenum.</p><p>Technical content of the exploration target has been approved by independent qualified person Yvan Bussieres, P.Eng., OIQ #31985, though the qualified person has been unable to verify information on adjacent properties. The company emphasizes that mineralization on adjacent properties is not necessarily indicative of mineralization on Opawica's properties. Additional technical information is available through regulatory filings at <a href="https://www.sedarplus.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.sedarplus.com</a>.</p><p>For business and technology leaders monitoring the mining sector, this announcement represents significant potential in the gold exploration space. The scale of the conceptual target, combined with the property's location in a proven gold district, suggests substantial upside potential for resource development. The proximity to established mining operations operated by major producers like Yamana Gold and Agnico Eagle Mines provides validation of the district's mineral potential while potentially offering infrastructure advantages.</p><p>The high-grade intercepts from historical drilling, particularly the 77.18 g/t gold over nearly 6 meters, demonstrate the property's capacity for significant gold concentrations. These results, combined with the extensive alteration zones and favorable geological setting, indicate a robust mineralizing system. The conceptual target's size range of 10-40 million tonnes at grades competitive with many operating mines suggests the potential for a substantial economic deposit if further exploration confirms the target.</p><p>For investors and industry observers, the timing of this announcement comes as gold prices remain elevated and mining companies seek new discoveries to replace depleting reserves. The technical validation by an independent qualified person adds credibility to the exploration target, while the availability of additional information through <a href="https://www.sedarplus.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.sedarplus.com</a> provides transparency for due diligence. The presence of multiple commodities beyond gold, including silver, copper, zinc and strategic metals, could enhance the property's economic potential in a world increasingly focused on critical mineral supply chains.</p>
