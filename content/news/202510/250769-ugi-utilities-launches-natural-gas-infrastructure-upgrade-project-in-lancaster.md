<p>UGI Utilities, Inc. will commence a natural gas main replacement project in Lancaster on Wednesday, October 15, representing a substantial infrastructure investment in the region. The project forms part of the company's ongoing commitment to maintaining safe and reliable service infrastructure while potentially expanding natural gas access to additional customers.</p><p>The underground construction work will focus on East Fulton Street between North Shippen Street and North Plum Street, including the intersections of North Plum Street and East Fulton Street, and North Shippen Street and East Fulton Street. Construction activities are scheduled Monday through Friday from 7:00am to 5:00pm, with completion of the new natural gas main installation anticipated by late November.</p><p>During the construction period, drivers should expect lane and parking restrictions along the affected routes. The project will also require temporary interruptions to natural gas service, necessitating UGI personnel to access properties for equipment inspection and relighting procedures. These service interruptions are strategically planned to minimize customer inconvenience while ensuring the safety and integrity of the upgraded system.</p><p>Following the main installation, temporary restoration of construction areas will occur immediately, with final paving scheduled for a later date. The project timeline accounts for both immediate infrastructure needs and long-term restoration of affected roadways and properties.</p><p>The system upgrades serve dual purposes: replacing aging infrastructure to maintain service reliability and potentially expanding natural gas access to additional customers. Property owners interested in converting to natural gas service during this project window have a unique opportunity while new infrastructure is being installed. UGI Utilities, Inc. serves more than 760,000 customers across its service territory and maintains comprehensive information about its operations and services available at <a href="https://www.ugi.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.ugi.com</a>.</p><p>The Lancaster project reflects UGI's broader infrastructure improvement strategy aimed at ensuring long-term system integrity and customer satisfaction. For business leaders and property owners in the area, this infrastructure investment represents both immediate operational considerations and long-term energy access opportunities that could impact property values and operational costs.</p>
