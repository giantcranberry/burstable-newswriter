<p>Affiliated Development has launched its second impact investment fund, Affiliated Housing Impact Fund II, LP, a $250 million vehicle that will deploy equity capital to finance high-quality, mixed-income workforce housing projects across Florida. The fund addresses the state's critical housing shortage by providing attainable, Class A living solutions through luxury multifamily communities at accessible rents. Building on the success of its inaugural fund launched in 2020, this new fund represents a continuation of Affiliated's proven strategy of transforming underserved markets through innovative public-private partnerships.</p><p>Affiliated Development principals Nick Rojo and Jeff Burns will serve as the sole general partners and managers of the fund, which specializes in public-private partnerships that utilize government financing incentives to make projects financially feasible. South Florida is the epicenter of the housing affordability crisis, according to Burns, who noted that over 60% of renters in the South Florida area are cost-burdened, meaning they pay more than 30% of their income on rent. This situation creates a sense of responsibility to work alongside local government to help find solutions to this growing issue.</p><p>The fund has completed its initial closing with the majority of commitments coming from local municipal, police and fire pension plans, many of which are repeat investors. This strong support reflects a shared vision of reinvesting capital back into local communities to drive economic growth while providing critical housing and generating market-rate returns. Rojo emphasized the importance of creating a win-win scenario where community investment drives financial returns, highlighting the company's expertise executing on this strategy paired with the agility to seize opportunities.</p><p>Since launching in 2014, Affiliated Development has been actively executing its strategy in the South Florida market. Recent approvals include The Ray, a 400-unit mixed-income workforce housing development in Sunrise, and The Cove, a 376-unit development in Fort Lauderdale. The company has also secured approvals for 636 units over two mixed-income public-private partnerships in Boynton Beach, The Dune and The Pierce, with groundbreaking on The Dune expected in Q4 of this year.</p><p>Current projects underway include The Era, a 400-unit development in Fort Lauderdale that broke ground in March, with two additional mixed-income workforce projects scheduled for delivery by year-end: The Tropic, a 223-unit project in Hollywood, and The Spruce, a 270-unit project in downtown West Palm Beach. Recently completed and stabilized properties include The Grand (309 units) in West Palm Beach, The Bohemian (200 units) and The Mid (230 units) in Lake Worth Beach, and The Six13 (142 units) in Fort Lauderdale.
