<p>US Nuclear Corp demonstrated significant financial improvement in its second quarter results, reporting a net loss reduction exceeding 54% compared to previous periods. The company's strategic approach to declining low-margin contracts and optimizing operational efficiency has positioned it for anticipated profitability in the third quarter, with management maintaining a positive outlook for full-year performance. This financial turnaround reflects a deliberate shift in business strategy that prioritizes sustainable growth over volume.</p><p>Chief Executive Officer Bob Goldstein provided additional context, noting that excluding non-cash charges and a delayed shipment, the company's first-half net loss would have been under $301,000. This represents a 49% decrease from the $617,404 loss recorded in the first half of 2024. Goldstein stated that while second quarter results approached breakeven, the company would have shown a small profit if not for the delayed shipment. The executive emphasized the continuation of their new policy of rejecting jobs with low margins or potential loss risks, a strategy that appears to be yielding measurable financial benefits.</p><p>The company has simultaneously strengthened its position in the nuclear energy sector through strategic investments in fusion technology. US Nuclear completed two transactions totaling $475,000 with equity partners in the nuclear fusion sector, involving shares in MIFTI, which develops thermonuclear fusion-powered reactors, and MIFTEC, focused on radio-isotope applications. Following a merger between these entities in September 2025, US Nuclear now holds 1,022,710 shares in the combined company. Goldstein expressed optimism about the long-term value of these investments and ongoing opportunities in both fission and fusion reactor development, signaling the company's commitment to advancing nuclear technology.</p><p>Operational expansion continues as the company integrates product lines from recent acquisitions. Nikki Truax, Director of Operations at Overhoff Technology, highlighted the consolidation of Optron's product lines with Overhoff Technologies in Milford, Ohio, and ECC, the calibration and service division. The combined portfolio now includes over 250 distinct products, necessitating increased sales capacity. Truax noted the company is actively seeking additional sales representatives, distributors, and an experienced Vice President of Sales to support growing customer demands while maintaining service quality standards.
