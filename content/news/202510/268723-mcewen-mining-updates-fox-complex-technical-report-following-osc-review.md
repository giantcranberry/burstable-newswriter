<p>McEwen Inc. has amended and refiled its technical report on the Fox Complex mineral resources in Ontario, Canada, following a review by the Ontario Securities Commission. The company, which trades on both the New York Stock Exchange and Toronto Stock Exchange under the symbol MUX, announced the refiling of its <a href="https://ibn.fm/MUX" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">NI 43-101 Technical Report on the Mineral Resources Estimate of the Fox Complex, Ontario, Canada</a> after the OSC review identified areas requiring additional disclosure.</p><p>The updated report now includes supplementary information mandated under Items 16 to 22 of Form 43-101F1, which applies specifically to advanced mineral properties. Additionally, the company replaced John Ryan Cox as a co-author to ensure full compliance with Qualified Person requirements under Canadian securities regulations. These administrative changes represent the only modifications made to the document, with the mineral resource statements for the Fox Complex remaining completely unchanged from the original April 4, 2025, filing.</p><p>This regulatory compliance action demonstrates the ongoing scrutiny that mining companies face regarding their technical disclosures and resource estimates. The OSC's continuous disclosure program regularly reviews corporate filings to ensure investors receive accurate and complete information about mineral projects. For shareholders and potential investors, the unchanged resource estimates provide continuity in understanding the Fox Complex's value proposition while the enhanced disclosure offers greater transparency about the property's advanced status.</p><p>McEwen Mining maintains diversified operations across the Americas, with three active mines in the United States, Canada, and Argentina, plus a significant copper development project in Argentina. The company's Los Azules copper project aims to become one of the world's first regenerative copper mines with a commitment to achieving carbon neutrality by 2038.</p><p>The technical report refiling process highlights the importance of regulatory compliance in the mining sector, particularly for companies with multiple listings across different exchanges. Investors rely on accurate technical reporting to make informed decisions about resource companies, and regulatory oversight helps maintain market integrity. The unchanged resource estimates provide stability in valuation metrics while the enhanced disclosure framework offers improved transparency for all stakeholders evaluating the Fox Complex's potential.</p>
