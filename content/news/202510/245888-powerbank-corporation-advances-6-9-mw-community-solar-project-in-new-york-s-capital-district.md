<p>PowerBank Corporation has secured a lease agreement for its 6.9 MW DC NY-Crawford Rd ground-mount solar project situated in New York's Capital District. The project is anticipated to qualify for financial incentives through NYSERDA's NY-Sun Program and will distribute clean, cost-effective electricity to local residents via a community solar framework. This initiative marks another advancement in New York's comprehensive renewable energy transition strategy.</p><p>The company is currently progressing through interconnection and permitting procedures while finalizing project financing arrangements. PowerBank brings considerable expertise to this development, having previously completed over 100 MW of solar installations. The company maintains an extensive development pipeline of 1 GW, positioning it to make substantial contributions toward New York's 6 GW solar capacity target established under the state's Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act.</p><p>Community solar projects such as NY-Crawford Rd provide renewable energy access to residents who cannot install solar panels on their own properties. Subscribers typically receive bill credits for electricity generated by their portion of the solar array, making clean energy more accessible and affordable for broader demographic segments. This model has gained significant momentum across New York as the state advances toward its climate objectives.</p><p>PowerBank Corporation functions as an independent renewable and clean energy project developer and owner, specializing in distributed and community solar installations throughout North America. The company develops solar and Battery Energy Storage System projects that supply electricity to utilities, commercial entities, industrial clients, municipal organizations, and residential consumers.
