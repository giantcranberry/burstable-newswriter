<p>Avangrid, Inc. has secured a position on the Forbes list of America's Best Employers for Women 2025, marking a significant achievement in the company's ongoing commitment to workplace equity and female empowerment. This recognition, developed in partnership with Statista, arrives as Avangrid continues to expand its energy portfolio and modernize grid infrastructure across the United States, positioning the company at the intersection of progressive workplace practices and critical energy sector leadership.</p><p>Jose Antonio Miranda, Avangrid CEO, emphasized the importance of this recognition, stating that it validates the company's core values and commitment to creating an environment where women are supported, heard, and empowered to lead. The company plans to continue investing in programs, policies, and leadership development initiatives that ensure women at Avangrid have opportunities to thrive while contributing to building a better energy future.</p><p>The Forbes America's Best Employers for Women 2025 ranking methodology involved comprehensive data collection through online panels, surveying over 140,000 women employed at U.S. companies with at least 1,000 employees over the past three years. The analysis exclusively considered responses from women and evaluated three critical criteria: personal evaluations from current employers, public evaluations from previous employers, and a Leadership Diversity Index measuring the percentage of women among top executives and board directors.</p><p>This latest honor adds to Avangrid's growing collection of workplace accolades, reinforcing the company's position as an employer of choice in the competitive energy sector. The company has been recognized by JUST Capital as one of the JUST 100 companies for the fifth consecutive year, ranking among America's best corporate citizens. Additionally, Avangrid earned its seventh consecutive designation among the World's Most Ethical Companies by the Ethisphere Institute in 2025. Other recent honors include being named a 2025 Corporate Wellness Innovator by Fast Company and Wellhub, and securing a spot on TIME's America's Best Mid-Size Companies of 2025 List for the second consecutive year.</p><p>With approximately 8,000 employees, Avangrid has established a safety-first culture across its operations while maintaining focus on inclusion and respect. This approach drives high employee satisfaction and enhances the company's ability to deliver reliable service to millions of customers daily. The company's operational strength is further demonstrated by its more than 10.5 gigawatts of generation capacity and ongoing investments in U.S. energy infrastructure.
