<p>October 2025 presents potential breakout opportunities for prepared traders as three ASX stocks demonstrate technical setups suggesting significant moves. Bravura Solutions (ASX: BVS) has generated market optimism following the announcement of new CEO Colin Greenhill starting in January 2026. The financial services software company has completed a long-term downtrend from 2023, with prices rising more than 700% and currently testing the critical $2.50 resistance level. A breakout above this level could project initial gains of 46%, with further potential upside of 70% toward all-time highs. Increasing trading volume confirms buyers are regaining control of the stock.</p><p>Alumina/Alcoa Corp (ASX: AAI) has followed a pattern of IPO euphoria, breaking below its issue price, and now showing remarkable recovery nearly back to the IPO price. The stock demonstrates its strongest weekly trading volume since listing, coupled with upward price reversals. Resistance around $53 marks the IPO price zone, with breaks above these levels potentially sparking rapid expansion toward $70+. As part of the materials sector, alumina and bauxite exposure benefits from broader commodity demand tailwinds, creating a textbook setup for breakout traders.</p><p>Rio Tinto (ASX: RIO), the heavyweight in this group, has frustrated investors with years of sideways movement but now flashes its first major breakout signal since 2015. The mining giant has broken its long-term downtrend for the first time since 2015, with strong support built around $110 and resistance near $135 presenting favorable reward-to-risk ratios. Rising volume accompanies the breakout, adding confidence to the technical picture. Rio offers the combination of top 20 ASX status, attractive dividends, volatility, and strong growth potential, with substantial upside if historical patterns repeat.</p><p>Professional trading education through government-accredited <a href="https://www.tradingcourses.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Trading courses</a> can help traders identify genuine breakouts from false signals.
