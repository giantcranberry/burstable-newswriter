<p>The software industry is experiencing a significant transformation as the era of Zero Interest Rate Policy gives way to higher interest rates and tighter capital markets. This shift has fundamentally altered investor priorities, moving away from the grow at all costs mentality that previously dominated the sector. According to Faisal Siddiqui, Director at CohnReznick, investors are now prioritizing software companies that can demonstrate a clear path to profitability alongside sustainable growth.</p><p>The change in market conditions has ended the period where smaller software companies could survive on continuous capital infusions. Instead, investors now seek companies that can grow at manageable rates without excessive cash burn or resource strain. This new environment has created challenges for many startups struggling to secure funding, even as larger technology companies continue to expand. The emphasis has shifted toward companies with sound business models, scalable operations, and long-term market potential.</p><p>To navigate this transformed landscape, many software companies are turning to professional services firms for assistance.
