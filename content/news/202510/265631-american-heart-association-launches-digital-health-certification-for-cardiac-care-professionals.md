<p>The American Heart Association has launched a new professional certification program addressing the growing challenge healthcare providers face in adapting to digital cardiac care technologies. The Digital Health in Cardiac Care certification aims to bridge the gap between traditional practice and remote patient monitoring while ensuring privacy and compatibility with existing healthcare systems. This certification represents the fourth offering in the Certified Professional by the American Heart Association science-based portfolio, joining existing certifications in telehealth, telehealth stroke, and tobacco treatment.</p><p>Developed by the American Heart Association Center for TelehealthÂ®, the program standardizes training and validates healthcare providers' expertise in technology-enabled clinical settings. Digital health in cardiac care encompasses the use of wearable devices, smartphone applications, telehealth platforms, and remote monitoring systems to help individuals manage and prevent heart conditions outside traditional clinical environments. According to Dr. Lee H. Schwamm, a volunteer member of the American Heart Association Center for Telehealth Expert Panel, this certification maintains quality standards while boosting patient engagement and empowering providers to manage chronic conditions more effectively through digital tools.</p><p>The certification process includes comprehensive digital health literacy training, evidence-based online education combining research and hands-on experiences, and assessment delivery through live remote-proctoring. Successful candidates receive certification awards and credentials valid for three years, with renewal available through American Heart Association platforms. Enrollment is open to licensed healthcare professionals, those pursuing licensure, and health and wellness specialists using digital health tools for patient monitoring and engagement.</p><p>Through December 31, customers purchasing the Digital Health in Cardiac Care Certification and Coursework Bundle can complete an additional Telehealth Certification and Coursework Bundle at no extra cost by using code TELEBOGO at checkout on the <a href="https://www.heart.org" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Professional Education Hub</a>. The certification program applies the same gold standard used by the Association for hospital certifications, with a stroke coordinator certification planned for later this year. This initiative represents a significant step toward standardizing digital health competencies across cardiac care, potentially improving patient outcomes through more consistent and effective use of emerging technologies in cardiovascular medicine.</p>
