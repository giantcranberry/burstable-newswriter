<p>A recent survey conducted by financial confidence company Boldin reveals that retirement uncertainties generate more fear than traditional Halloween scares for most Americans. The online poll of more than 1,000 financially savvy individuals found that 66% considered their pre-planning retirement fears more terrifying than walking alone in the woods on a dark Halloween night.</p><p>The survey, conducted on October 10, 2025, examined retirement concerns among people using <a href="https://Boldin.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Boldin.com</a> to manage their financial plans. Results showed that retirement worries were pervasive before individuals established formal plans, with 67% reporting regular anxiety about their financial future. More than a quarter (27%) described these fears as weighing on them quite significantly, while 40% felt somewhat worried and 26% were slightly concerned. Only 3% reported no retirement-related anxiety.</p><p>Running out of money emerged as the dominant concern, with 39% of respondents identifying outliving their savings as their greatest fear before creating a retirement plan. Other significant worries included inability to afford desired lifestyles in retirement (19%) and uncertainty about preparing for future unknowns like market volatility and inflation (17%). The data suggests financial planning directly addresses these core anxieties.</p><p>The survey demonstrates that written retirement plans dramatically reduce financial fears. An overwhelming 96% of respondents reported increased confidence about their future after establishing a plan, with 68% feeling much more confident and 28% somewhat more confident. Only 3% indicated that having a plan didn't change their outlook. When asked about their current retirement feelings, 46% described themselves as confident, 49% as somewhat confident, and only 4% as anxious. Notably, no Boldin users reported outright fear about their financial future once they had implemented a plan.</p><p>Steve Chen, Founder and CEO of Boldin, noted that the data confirms what the company has observed through user interactions. When people develop financial knowledge and create structured plans, they gain clarity for making informed decisions. The company's mission focuses on making financial planning accessible and affordable so individuals can address their fears and retire with confidence.</p><p>Survey respondents identified specific proactive steps that increased their retirement security. Running what-if scenarios and contingency planning helped 66% feel more secure, while 43% established guaranteed income streams through pensions, Social Security, or annuities. Other confidence-building strategies included becoming debt-free (36%), consistent saving and investing (34%), and seeking professional financial guidance through services like <a href="https://Boldin.com/Advisors" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Boldin Advisors</a> (26%).</p><p>While financial concerns dominated retirement anxieties, health-related worries also featured prominently. More than half (57%) identified financial challenges including healthcare costs and loss of financial control as their primary source of anxiety. Meanwhile, 43% expressed greater concern about non-financial issues such as declining health, loss of purpose, or social isolation. The survey highlights how comprehensive retirement planning must address both financial security and quality-of-life considerations.</p>
