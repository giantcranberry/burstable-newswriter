<p>UMAXX has partnered with LifeLock to offer built-in identity protection and private browsing capabilities to all internet customers, making it the first internet provider to include such comprehensive security features as standard components of every service plan. This telecom industry-leading initiative brings identity theft protection and personal privacy tools directly to customers without requiring additional subscriptions or setup.</p><p>Jim Devericks, Founder and CEO of SuperCloud International, UMAXX's parent company, stated that customer demand for data security drove this partnership. More than 75 million Americans have been affected by identity theft, with consequences ranging from unauthorized credit activity to tax fraud and stolen social security numbers. In an era of constant digital threats, UMAXX is positioning security as a fundamental standard rather than an optional extra.</p><p>The integrated security package includes three key components available through <a href="https://www.lifelock.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">LifeLock</a> identity theft protection services. Customers receive monitoring for potential identity threats including changes to credit files and personal information exposure on the dark web, along with access to U.S.-based Identity Restoration Specialists who assist if identities become compromised.</p><p>Financial protection forms another critical element of the offering. The LifeLock Million Dollar Protection Package provides up to $1 million for lawyers and experts to resolve identity theft cases. Additionally, the package covers up to $25,000 for stolen funds from bank, investment, or credit accounts due to identity theft, plus reimbursement for expenses like childcare, travel, and lost wages incurred during identity restoration.</p><p>Complementing the identity protection, the Norton Encrypted Private Network ensures secure, private internet connections that help keep online activity confidential, even when using public Wi-Fi. This integration of cybersecurity directly into internet service represents a significant shift in consumer expectations for digital protection.</p><p>Ian Bednowitz, General Manager of LifeLock, emphasized that the collaboration reflects a shared commitment to protecting digital freedom and empowering users to navigate online spaces with confidence. The partnership leverages UMAXX's existing proprietary military-grade, closed-end 5G network, which already delivers secure streaming and download speeds up to 2Gbps. With these additional security layers, UMAXX transforms from merely an internet service into what the company describes as a personal digital fortress for customers and their families.</p>
