<p>ORGANA International, operating since 1997, is celebrating its 30th year in business with a growing base of loyal customers and continued 5-star rating from the Better Business Bureau. With thousands of repeat buyers nationwide and products already available on <a href="https://www.amazon.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Amazon</a>, the company is preparing for the next phase of its U.S. distribution expansion. This milestone reflects sustained consumer trust in natural wellness products during an era of increasing health consciousness.</p><p>The company began nearly three decades ago with the vision of founder Sam Curtis, who developed a unique method to filter decomposed plant matter rich in 76 trace minerals and fulvic acid—nutrients essential to human health. After Curtis' passing in 2012, longtime industry veteran Larry Mills acquired the company, expanded its product line, and strengthened its customer-first mission. Reaching nearly 30 years in business is not about how long we've been around—it's about the people who continue to trust and use our products year after year, said Mills, CEO of ORGANA International.</p><p>ORGANA's flagship product, the multi-mineral drink, provides a convenient way to replenish the body's essential nutrients in one daily serving. The product line has grown to include flavored mineral beverages in cherry, wildberry pomegranate, and peach mango varieties, along with magnesium cream for muscle support, liquid oxygen supplements, silver-based immune support, and Essiac tea for detoxification. All products are formulated with pharmaceutical-grade water and natural ingredients, ensuring bioavailability and safety.</p><p>Unlike many synthetic supplements, ORGANA products are naturally derived and tested under a microscope for Brownian movement—a sign the particles are still alive and active. With a particle size of just 20 nanometers, the minerals can pass through the skin barrier and down to the cellular level, allowing the body to easily absorb what it needs while safely excreting what it doesn't. This scientific approach to natural wellness has attracted customers ranging from families and athletes to seniors and everyday health-conscious consumers.</p><p>The company has proudly maintained its 5-star <a href="https://www.bbb.org" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Better Business Bureau</a> rating while upholding its long-standing philosophy that the customer is always right. Every product is backed by a satisfaction guarantee, and customer feedback continues to fuel the company's growth. Success to us isn't just measured in numbers, Mills added. It's when a customer tells us their energy is better, their recovery is faster, or their health has improved. That's what keeps us moving forward.</p><p>As ORGANA International celebrates its 30th year, the company is preparing for the next phase of growth with broader distribution channels on the horizon. The company's mission remains focused on delivering natural, bioavailable products that help people live healthier lives, building on three decades of customer trust and product innovation in the natural wellness industry. This expansion signals continued confidence in the growing market for scientifically-backed natural health solutions.</p>
