The company now projects sales between EUR 278 million and EUR 288 million, a substantial increase from previous estimates of EUR 248 million to EUR 261 million.

BIKE24 now anticipates adjusted EBITDA of approximately EUR 12.5 million to EUR 13.5 million, compared to the previous range of EUR 7.0 million to EUR 12.1 million.
