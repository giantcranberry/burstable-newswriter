<p>Enchilada's Restaurant, a Greenville Avenue landmark known for its warm hospitality and award-winning margaritas, has unveiled a creative marketing campaign designed to celebrate its loyal guests in true Dallas style. The "Mustache Tex-Mex Takeover" campaign features a humorous, hand-drawn black mustache appearing on guests of all ages—from bikers and brunch families to office workers and kids—all declaring one line that's quickly becoming a Dallas favorite: "I'm Feeling Tex-Mexy."</p><p>The campaign honors Enchilada's role as Dallas' friendly neighborhood Tex-Mex host, connecting decades of tradition with today's social storytelling culture. Each playful visual appears across social media, in-store displays, table tents, and email marketing, showcasing the restaurant's humor, inclusiveness, and community spirit. "We wanted to create something instantly recognizable that reflects the joy and personality our guests bring to Enchilada's every day," noted Enchilada's owner Tony Waldrop.</p><p>"The mustache motif makes everyone part of the fun—it's a wink to the Tex-Mex flair that's part of who we are." As part of the campaign, Enchilada's has launched its VIP Rewards Program with the cheeky slogan "Get a Mustache of Your Own!" Guests who join the program receive $10 off their next visit, plus access to exclusive specials, birthday perks, and members-only events. The restaurant's goal is to enroll 5,000 VIP members in 12 months, building stronger connections with regulars and first-time visitors alike.</p><p>The campaign will roll out across Dallas this fall, supported by local influencer collaborations, office catering promotions, and mustache-themed social media Reels showcasing guests, staff, and fans.
