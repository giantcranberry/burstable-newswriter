<p>The American Bus Association (ABA) has named Avista Resort a 2025 Best of the Best award winner in the lodging category, recognizing the North Myrtle Beach property for delivering exceptional service, hospitality, and group travel experiences. This prestigious award, presented by Destinations magazine—the official publication of the ABA—honors travel industry partners across North America that excel in serving motorcoach groups and the broader group travel industry.</p><p>Each year, the Best of the Best awards identify top-rated hotels, attractions, and destinations that demonstrate superior performance in accommodating tour operators, motorcoach travelers, and group planners. Avista Resort earned this distinction through its outstanding accommodations, thoughtful amenities, and personalized service approach that has made it a preferred destination for organized travel groups.</p><p>"We're so honored to be recognized by the American Bus Association as one of the Best of the Best in Lodging for 2025," said Kim Lewis, Director of Sales at Myrtle Beach Seaside Resorts. "This award means a lot to us because it comes from our peers and the tour groups who've chosen to stay with us year after year. It's a wonderful reflection of the care and dedication our entire Avista team puts into making every guest feel welcome."</p><p>The oceanfront resort's success in group travel accommodation stems from its comprehensive facilities and strategic location. Situated just steps from the Atlantic Ocean, Avista Resort offers condo-style accommodations with full kitchens and private balconies, complemented by extensive amenities including indoor and outdoor pools, a lazy river, and on-site dining at Just Off Main. The property's group-friendly spaces, ample motorcoach parking, and proximity to area attractions have established it as a trusted destination for group tours, reunions, retreats, and special events.</p><p>This recognition carries significant implications for the hospitality and tourism sectors, particularly as group travel continues to represent a substantial market segment. The award validates the strategic importance of investing in infrastructure and staff training specifically designed to meet the unique needs of motorcoach travelers and organized tour groups. Properties that can effectively accommodate large groups while maintaining high service standards are increasingly positioned for competitive advantage in the evolving travel landscape.</p><p>The American Bus Association serves as the leading trade organization for the motorcoach, group travel, and tourism industry in North America.
