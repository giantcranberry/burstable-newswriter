<p>Solstice Advanced Materials began trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market under the ticker symbol SOLS, establishing its first day as an independent, publicly traded company following completion of its spin-off from Honeywell. The specialty materials company launches with approximately 4,000 employees, 24 manufacturing sites, and four research and development centers serving more than 3,000 customers across 120 countries and territories. This separation creates a pure-play specialty materials company with an advanced materials heritage spanning more than 130 years.</p><p>The spin-off was executed through a distribution of Solstice common stock to Honeywell shareholders. Each Honeywell shareowner of record as of October 17, 2025, received one share of Solstice common stock for every four shares of Honeywell common stock held. This strategic move allows Solstice to operate as an independent entity focused specifically on advanced materials innovation and market development.</p><p>David Sewell, President and Chief Executive Officer of Solstice Advanced Materials, stated that the independence positions the company to capitalize on powerful secular trends shaping the industry. These include regulatory-driven transitions in cooling and building solutions alongside the rapid proliferation of artificial intelligence and advanced computing. The company's technologies enable high-performance solutions for critical global sectors including HVAC/R, semiconductor manufacturing, data center thermal management, nuclear energy, defense, and life sciences.</p><p>Solstice brings to market a robust portfolio of over 5,700 patents and operates under renowned brands including Solstice, Genetron, Aclar, Spectra, Fluka, and Hydranal. The company's materials support applications ranging from refrigerants and healthcare packaging to protective fibers and nuclear power components. Additional company information is available through their corporate website at <a href="https://www.Solstice.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.Solstice.com</a>.</p><p>The company utilizes its Investor Relations website at <a href="https://investor.solstice.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://investor.solstice.com</a> as a primary channel for disclosing information material to investors and for complying with disclosure obligations under Regulation FD. Investors are encouraged to monitor this platform alongside the company's press releases, SEC filings, public conference calls, and webcasts for ongoing updates about the newly independent entity's performance and strategic initiatives. This separation represents a significant development in the specialty materials sector, creating a focused company positioned to address evolving market demands across multiple high-growth industries.</p>
