<p>The strategic partnership between Airbus Defence and Space and Omnitronics focuses on developing interoperable gateways that bridge Airbus's Agnet and TETRA technologies with narrowband standards including P25 and DMR, alongside Omnitronics' advanced radio dispatch management systems. This collaboration aims to achieve seamless integration and enhanced communications capabilities for mission-critical environments where reliable communication directly impacts operational success.</p><p>Airbus Defence and Space brings its position as a global leader in secure, mission-critical communication and collaboration platforms to the partnership, supporting agencies that demand reliable, intelligent, and secure systems. The company offers seamless, secure and cyber-resilient mission- and business-critical communication tools for public safety and private organizations, as well as users in transportation, utilities, healthcare, and event security. Their advanced solutions, which combine TETRA, Tetrapol, and broadband technologies, enhance situational awareness and optimize operational efficiency. Additional information about Airbus solutions is available at <a href="https://www.airbus.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.airbus.com</a>.</p><p>Omnitronics complements this partnership with decades of expertise in Radio over IP, dispatch systems, and interoperability solutions tailored for mission- and business-critical operations. The company brings specialized expertise in Digital Radio Management, Dispatch, Interoperability and Radio over IP, with products operating 24/7 in control centers and radio infrastructures of vital organizations worldwide. More details about Omnitronics and their mission-critical communication systems can be found at <a href="https://www.omnitronicsworld.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.omnitronicsworld.com</a>.</p><p>Alain Ruinet, Head of APAC for Public Safety and Security at Airbus Defence and Space, emphasized the strategic importance of this collaboration, stating that combining Airbus' robust platforms with Omnitronics' proven technology and expertise will deliver flexible and reliable solutions tailored to evolving customer needs. John Jordan, CEO of Omnitronics, highlighted how partnering with Airbus allows the company to extend capabilities and contribute to next-generation critical communication systems while exploring innovative ways to improve operational efficiency and safety across multiple sectors.</p><p>The interoperability solutions address a critical gap in current communication infrastructure where different agencies and organizations often operate on incompatible systems. By creating gateways that connect Airbus technologies with widely used narrowband standards, the partnership ensures that first responders, security personnel, and critical infrastructure operators can communicate effectively regardless of equipment choices. This becomes particularly vital during large-scale emergencies and cross-border operations where multiple agencies must coordinate responses efficiently.</p><p>The partnership leverages Airbus's involvement in multinational R&D projects and standard-setting for future technologies based on 4G and 5G, combined with Omnitronics' international network and four decades of experience in critical communications. This combination represents a significant advancement in addressing complex communication needs of modern critical operations across public safety, transportation, utilities, and event security sectors, potentially transforming how emergency services and critical infrastructure operators coordinate during crises.</p>
