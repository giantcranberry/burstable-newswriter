<p>The Yiwu Global Digital Trade Center, the flagship project of the city's sixth-generation market, officially opened on October 14, completing the market's latest upgrade and signaling Yiwu's transformation from traditional trade to a full-scale digital-commerce ecosystem. This development positions the city as a global hub characterized by fashion, international standards, modernity, digital integration, and low-carbon operations.</p><p>Located in the middle of Zhejiang Province approximately 300 kilometers from Shanghai, Yiwu has established itself as a commercial and trade city with vibrant markets and unlimited business opportunities. The city has released China's first Market Credit Index and has been recognized by authoritative organizations as the world's largest small-commodity wholesale market. With the arrival of the digital trade era, Yiwu now stands at the forefront of market iterative upgrades.</p><p>The massive 1.25 million square meter center integrates five distinct zones: market areas, office buildings, commercial districts, apartments, and the Digital Trade Hub. The market already hosts vendors specializing in fashion jewelry, creative and trendy toys, and smart equipment. More than half of these vendors represent second-generation merchants, next-generation start-ups, or brand and intellectual property owners, indicating a shift toward more sophisticated business operations.</p><p>Over 3,700 new stall-holders are utilizing and selling AI tools within the center, while buyers can navigate the facility using AI assistance to locate products, shops, and contacts more efficiently. Zhou Jian, General Manager of Yiwu China Commodities City Big Data Co., Ltd., explained that tenants are mass-producing promotional videos using the in-house Xiaoshang AI Video Creator. This technology has dramatically reduced production time and costs from what previously required a week and upwards of RMB 1,000 (approximately $140) per clip to mere minutes.</p><p>Cao Fanyue, owner of Muqi Jewelry, highlighted how the AI tools have transformed her business operations. Silver-jewelry development, once capital-intensive, now benefits from instant design generation through Xiaoshang AI, allowing her company to produce over 200 new stock-keeping units monthly. The center establishes one high-level Digital Trade Hub supported by three core platforms: <a href="https://www.chinagoods.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Chinagoods</a> for digital trading services, a digital supply-chain platform for efficient logistics, and Yiwu Pay for settlement, collectively creating an end-to-end digital commerce infrastructure.</p><p>The facility also implements multiple digital-empowerment scenarios while supporting the rapid expansion of AI large models, digital trade, and cross-border e-commerce. This comprehensive approach to digital transformation represents a significant advancement in global trade infrastructure, potentially setting new standards for wholesale markets worldwide as they adapt to the demands of digital commerce.</p>
