<p>The construction technology sector is experiencing a significant shift as Buildots, recognized as the global leader in AI-powered progress tracking, has acquired workforce management platform Genda. This strategic acquisition aims to merge two traditionally separate data streams in construction—project progress monitoring and workforce insights—creating what Buildots CEO Roy Danon characterizes as a foundation model for the construction industry.</p><p>The timing of this acquisition aligns with a critical period for construction technology adoption, where enterprise-wide implementation is becoming standard rather than limited to pilot programs or individual projects. Danon emphasized that in the current AI era, access to accurate and high-quality data is essential for creating meaningful customer impact. The combination of Buildots and Genda will enable the company to offer customers a single platform that integrates workforce, productivity, and progress data.</p><p>Buildots revolutionized construction progress tracking through computer vision and artificial intelligence, but understanding complete productivity required connecting what's being built with who's building it. The integration addresses a fundamental industry challenge where data about project progress and workforce insights are typically collected manually and fragmented across different systems. By bringing together Buildots' progress intelligence with Genda's workforce insights, construction teams can finally determine which strategies for reducing delays actually work and understand the underlying reasons.</p><p>Danon explained that the acquisition stems from a shared vision between the two companies. We acquired Genda to combine these insights and open the door to broader productivity intelligence, he stated. The company's pioneering work in using AI to provide accurate progress, pace and delay risk insights fundamentally changed how contractors manage risk, but the absence of integrated workforce data represented a crucial gap in the productivity puzzle.</p><p>For existing Buildots customers, the acquisition will bring gradual but significant changes. Initially, the products will remain separate and sold independently. Over time, however, we'll begin to integrate insights from both systems, Danon explained. The ultimate goal is for customers to access both progress tracking data and workforce insights within the same platform, enabling analysis of the connection between workers' onsite activity and construction progress.</p><p>The acquisition also strengthens Buildots' North American presence, particularly in Austin, Texas. Austin is one of several hubs in the US where we'll expand our presence in the upcoming months, Danon noted. That expansion is driven by Texas experiencing tremendous construction activity, especially around data centers. The Austin team will play an important role in supporting local clients and strengthening North American operations as the company continues to scale.</p><p>Danon's vision of a foundation model for construction involves creating a single unified large data model based on diverse construction data sets, including progress, workforce and other relevant information. We aim for Buildots to serve as a shared intelligence engine that unifies insights, automates analysis, and drives smarter, data-led decision-making across the industry, he stated. The company is moving beyond isolated tools to build an enterprise platform that helps organizations benchmark productivity across projects and portfolios.</p><p>Buildots is expanding teams with deep domain expertise in high-growth sectors like data centers and chip fabrication facilities, as well as more traditional construction markets. Our goal remains to help construction shift from reactive, experience-based decision-making to a proactive, data-driven approach, Danon concluded. Ultimately, it's about achieving operational excellence so that the industry can meet the scale and complexity of the decade ahead.</p>
