<p>The DFW Car & Toy Museum is currently featuring a 1971 Mercedes-Benz 280SL in classic silver, representing the final production year of the celebrated W113 Pagoda series. This vehicle stands as a masterclass in understated luxury and engineering finesse from one of Germany's most revered automotive manufacturers. Designed by the legendary trio of Friedrich Geiger, Béla Barényi, and Paul Bracq, the W113 series first debuted at the 1963 Geneva Motor Show and quickly earned acclaim for its clean lines, signature concave hardtop, and perfect balance between sporty performance and grand touring comfort.</p><p>This particular 280SL showcases the refined engineering that made the model so respected among automotive enthusiasts. Powered by a 2.8-liter M130 inline-six engine featuring Bosch mechanical fuel injection, the vehicle delivers power to the rear wheels through a four-speed automatic transmission. The braking system features power-assisted four-wheel disc brakes, a technological advancement that was ahead of its time in the early 1970s and contributed to the car's reputation for confident and smooth stopping power.</p><p>Inside the cabin, the 280SL reflects both luxury and thoughtful simplicity with carefully preserved original features. The interior includes a wood-trimmed dashboard, analog clock, replacement carpeting, and a period-correct Frigiking air conditioning unit—a rare and desirable option that enhances the vehicle's comfort and collectibility. Additional interior elements include a floor-mounted gear shifter, Becker Europa AM/FM push-button radio, and a two-spoke steering wheel with chrome horn ring. These components frame a cluster of VDO gauges featuring a 140-mph speedometer, tachometer, and indicators for fuel level, oil pressure, and coolant temperature.</p><p>Ron Sturgeon, owner of the DFW Car & Toy Museum, emphasized the vehicle's enduring appeal, stating that the 280SL represents the perfect blend of art and engineering. He noted that the car doesn't scream for attention but earns it quietly through its beauty, craftsmanship, and continuing relevance in automotive culture. The 1971 model year is often regarded as the ultimate evolution of the W113 chassis, marking the end of an era for Mercedes-Benz while establishing a benchmark for vintage roadster design that continues to influence automotive aesthetics today.</p><p>The vehicle is part of The Ron Sturgeon Collection at the museum, which recently relocated to a new 150,000-square-foot facility in North Fort Worth. The museum offers free parking and admission, maintaining hours from Tuesday through Saturday, 9:00 am to 6:00 pm.

Whether appreciated for its mechanical sophistication or sculpted silhouette, this silver Mercedes-Benz 280SL remains a powerful symbol of timeless automotive luxury and engineering achievement.</p>
