<p>Bollinger Innovations, Inc. (NASDAQ: BINI) will transition its common stock trading from Nasdaq to the OTCID market effective October 13, 2025, maintaining the BINI ticker symbol. The electric vehicle manufacturer's decision follows withdrawal from Nasdaq hearings after receiving notice of noncompliance with Listing Rule 5550(b)(2). The company expects Nasdaq suspension at market open on October 13 with immediate commencement of OTCID trading.</p><p>This strategic shift is designed to provide greater operational flexibility and reduce compliance-related costs while maintaining transparency through the OTC's enhanced disclosure standards. The move enables Bollinger to allocate resources more efficiently toward expanding its commercial electric vehicle footprint during a period of significant industry growth and technological advancement in electric transportation. The company continues to evaluate OTC market tiers, potential international listings, and a possible future return to a national exchange while maintaining its commitment to investor engagement despite the market transition.</p><p>Bollinger Innovations operates a U.S. manufacturing facility in Tunica, Mississippi, where it produces commercial electric vehicles including the ONE Class 1 EV cargo van and THREE Class 3 EV cab chassis truck. These vehicles are currently available for sale in the United States through the company's commercial dealer network. The company's dealer network includes six established partners: Pap√© Kenworth, Pritchard EV, National Auto Fleet Group, Ziegler Truck Group, Range Truck Group, and Randy Marion Auto Group, providing sales and service coverage across key markets including the West Coast, Midwest, Pacific Northwest, and Mid-Atlantic regions.</p><p>The company's subsidiary, Bollinger Motors of Oak Park, Michigan, represents an established EV truck operation that has achieved significant milestones, including launching production of its B4 Class 4 electric truck on September 16, 2024. Bollinger Motors has developed a comprehensive dealer network with over 50 locations across the United States for sales and service support. Additional information about the company's developments can be found in their newsroom at <a href="https://ibn.fm/BINI" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://ibn.fm/BINI</a>.</p><p>This market transition reflects broader trends in the electric vehicle industry where companies are balancing regulatory requirements with operational needs during rapid expansion phases. For business leaders and investors, Bollinger's move demonstrates how companies in capital-intensive sectors like electric vehicle manufacturing are optimizing resource allocation to support growth initiatives while maintaining market access. The transition to OTC Markets could serve as a model for other emerging technology companies seeking to reduce compliance burdens while continuing operations and investor communication during critical growth periods.</p>
