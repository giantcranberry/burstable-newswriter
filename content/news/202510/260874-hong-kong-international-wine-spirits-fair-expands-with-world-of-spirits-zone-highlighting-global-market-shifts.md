<p>The 17th Hong Kong International Wine & Spirits Fair, organized by the Hong Kong Trade Development Council, will take place from November 6-8 at the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre, featuring over 620 exhibitors from 21 countries and regions. This year's event marks the debut of the World of Spirits zone, showcasing spirits from 13 countries including Chinese baijiu, brandy, gin, rum, tequila, vodka, and whisky. The expansion responds to growing market demand for spirits and follows last year's Policy Address announcement regarding liquor duty reduction, strengthening Hong Kong's position as an international trade platform.</p><p>Jenny Koo, Deputy Executive Director of HKTDC, stated that the duty reduction on high-end liquor has positively impacted the industry and encouraged diversified development in the spirits market. The new World of Spirits zone allows buyers and visitors to explore diverse flavors from around the world, supported by approximately 20 activities promoting spirits market development. Exhibitors represent Hong Kong, multiple Chinese provinces including Fujian, Guizhou, Hubei, Sichuan, Jiangsu, Xinjiang, and Zhejiang, as well as international participants from Argentina, Australia, Belarus, Brazil, Chile, Czechia, France, Germany, India, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Portugal, Russia, South Korea, Spain, and the United States.</p><p>Chinese baijiu features prominently in the World of Spirits zone, with six of the Top 10 Chinese Baijiu Brands participating, including Kweichow Moutai, Jiangsu Yanghe, Wuliangye, Luzhou Laojiao, Jiannanchun, and Langjiu from Sichuan. Kweichow Moutai will showcase its iconic Flying Fairy Moutai and award-winning Golden Prince Moutai Prince, recognized as a 2024 Annual Golden Case in Activity Marketing. Luzhou Laojiao, inscribed in the First National Intangible Cultural Heritage List of China, will present Luzhou Laojiao Antique Edition and Guojiao 1573, while launching a new baijiu on the fair's opening day. Wuliangye and Yanghe demonstrate the trend of integrating innovative technologies into the baijiu industry, targeting younger and more diverse markets.</p><p>Hong Kong brands are gaining prominence, with actor Timmy Hung's brand Hongjiaban Maotai blending traditional brewing techniques with Hong Kong-style flavors and action movie culture while strictly following Maotai's ancient brewing methods. International offerings include Austria's Martin & Ann Arndorfer Anina Verde, a top-tier Austrian natural wine, and Italy's Don Carlo, featuring a unique brewing process taking over three years. Japan's Hyakusyun Junmai Daiginjo uses locally grown Mino Nishiki sake rice cultivated through natural farming methods, preserved unfiltered to maintain original flavor and natural effervescence. Estonia's Punch Club OÜ specializes in organic, low-sugar, ready-to-drink cocktails for health-conscious consumers, reflecting rising demand for low-alcohol beverages.</p><p>Nearly half of this year's activities focus on spirits, including the 2025 China Baijiu Culture International Promotion Asia Forum co-hosted by the China Alcoholic Drinks Association and HKTDC on November 6. The 2025 Hong Kong International Spirits Challenge Awards Ceremony on November 7, organized by the Hong Kong General Chamber of Wine & Spirits, will honor outstanding Chinese baijiu brands. Tomy Fong, an experienced Chinese baijiu connoisseur, will present Baijiu – The Rising Trend to explore current trends, while the Baijiu 101 Class on the final day, organized by VTC, allows public participants to experience baijiu culture and tasting methods while learning about its 12 aroma types.</p><p>Three Masters of Wine will host major events: Debra Meiburg leads the Cathay Global Wine & Spirits Awards Asia Presentation Ceremony, Wine Industry Conference: AI in Wine Business, and Austrian Wine and Local Sauce Pairing Workshop. Jennifer Docherty shares insights in a seminar titled Off the beaten path, gems from unsung regions, while Xing Wei hosts Tasting Chinese Terroir Wines and joins Carlito Chiu and Calvin Choi in blind tasting events selecting favorite wines and spirits as industry references. Additional competitions include HK Best Spirits Awards 2025, Hong Kong International Mixology Showdown 2025, and Mixology Party, alongside pairing sessions like WINE LUXE Hong Kong TOP 10 Wine Pairing Restaurant Awards Presentation Ceremony 2025 and Sake-Chinese Food Pairing.</p><p>On the final day, the Wine Fiesta Zone opens to public ticket holders aged 18 or above for sampling and purchasing wines and spirits, with regular tickets priced at HK$220 and specially priced tickets at HK$128 available through various platforms including <a href="https://www.hktdc.com/event/hkwinefair/en" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.hktdc.com/event/hkwinefair/en</a>.
