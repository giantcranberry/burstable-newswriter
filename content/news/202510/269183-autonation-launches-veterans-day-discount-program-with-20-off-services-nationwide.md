<p>AutoNation is recognizing America's military veterans with an exclusive 20% discount on all services at AutoNation-branded locations nationwide and through AutoNation Mobile Service from November 10-15, 2025. The discount extends to all active U.S. Military personnel, veterans, and their spouses as part of the company's Veterans Day appreciation efforts. This initiative represents AutoNation's broader corporate philosophy of supporting military communities through both consumer benefits and employment pathways.</p><p>Christian Treiber, AutoNation's President of After-Sales, emphasized the company's gratitude toward military members. "America's Veterans, including more than 1,000 proud team members at AutoNation, have earned our deepest gratitude for their service and sacrifice," Treiber said. "To our active military, Veterans, and their families, thank you for all you do to keep our country safe. Your dedication is an inspiration." The discount program demonstrates how corporations can create meaningful value for military families through targeted consumer benefits.</p><p>Service verification requires presentation of appropriate military documentation, including a leave and earning statement, U.S. Military ID card, or DD Form 214. Complete offer details are available at <a href="https://www.autonation.com/offers/military-discounts" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.autonation.com/offers/military-discounts</a>. The inclusion of AutoNation Mobile Service, which operates in nearly 1,000 cities across the country providing over 200 different vehicle services, expands accessibility for military families who may face scheduling challenges or transportation limitations.</p><p>The company's commitment to veterans extends beyond seasonal discounts through strategic workforce development partnerships. AutoNation collaborates with the U.S. Army through the Partnership for Your Success (PaYs) program, which connects soldiers transitioning to civilian life with career opportunities at the automotive retailer.

By combining consumer discounts with employment pathways, AutoNation creates sustainable value for military communities while building brand loyalty and workforce diversity. The program's timing during Veterans Day provides meaningful recognition while addressing practical needs for vehicle maintenance and career transitions, setting a benchmark for corporate-military partnerships in the automotive and retail sectors.</p>
