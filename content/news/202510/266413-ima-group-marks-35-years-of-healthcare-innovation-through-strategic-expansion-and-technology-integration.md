<p>The IMA Group (IMA) celebrates its 35th anniversary, demonstrating resilience and reinvention under President and CEO Mark Weinberger, PhD, MPH. Over the past 14 years, Weinberger and his team have transformed IMA from its origins in medical screenings and psychological evaluations into a national organization with more than 150 locations and a rapidly growing clinical research network. A licensed psychologist and psychiatric epidemiologist, Weinberger emphasizes that better data and clearer access to services enable improved decisions for patients, clients, and communities.</p><p>IMA's longevity stems from three foundational pillars: exceptional people, commitment to quality, and adaptability. Founded by industry pioneer David Pulver, MD, in 1990, the company has cultivated a culture centered on purpose, adaptability, and accountability. Strategic investments in scalable systems and talent ensure the organization evolves alongside shifting healthcare policies, payer expectations, and care delivery models. This balance between agility and consistency, anchored in quality standards, has maintained IMA's relevance and trustworthiness across decades of healthcare industry transformation.</p><p>Today, IMA serves as a national leader in outsourced medical, psychological, and ancillary evaluations and screenings for government agencies, insurers, third-party administrators (TPAs), and employers. For public safety programs, the organization delivers comprehensive psychological and medical assessments for police officers, firefighters, and other essential personnel. In workers' compensation, disability, injury, and auto liability claims, IMA supports insurers and employers through independent medical exams (IMEs), medical file reviews, case management, and rehabilitation guidance.</p><p>The strategic expansion into clinical research represents a significant evolution for the organization. Beginning in 2018, IMA implemented a growth strategy combining organic investment and targeted acquisitions, including 19 businesses with 10 now forming the research division. This expansion aligns with the company's evaluation services, as both emphasize precise data collection, regulatory discipline, and patient-centered execution. IMA's network of over 150 clinics nationwide includes 19 dedicated research sites conducting Phase II-IV clinical trials across diverse geographic locations from New York and Chicago to Albuquerque, NM, and Hickory, NC.</p><p>Technology integration plays a crucial role in IMA's operational model, with AI tools and predictive modeling optimizing trial recruitment, patient matching, and data analysis. The implementation of telehealth visits, mobile data capture, remote monitoring, and home visits reduces barriers and improves convenience for patients. For evaluation services, secure scheduling dashboards, portals, and real-time tracking ensure transparency and timely reporting for clients.</p><p>Looking forward, IMA's growth strategy focuses on expanding clinical research in therapeutic areas including CNS, sleep, metabolic disease, and GLP-1 studies, while improving patient representation in trials to reflect diverse populations. The organization will also scale evaluation services in workers' compensation, liability, auto/no-fault, and occupational health sectors. Future initiatives include piloting hybrid and decentralized trials, advanced biomarkers, and real-world evidence integration. Guided by principles of quality, clinical excellence, scientific rigor, and compassionate humanity, IMA aims to advance health outcomes, support individuals, and maintain trust in the evolving healthcare landscape.</p>
