<p>Healthcare Triangle, Inc. has secured approximately $1.63 million in gross proceeds through warrant exercise agreements with three existing accredited investors. The digital transformation company facilitated the transaction by restructuring outstanding warrants, reducing the exercise price from $20.92 to $2.00 per share to encourage immediate participation from current investors.</p><p>The arrangement involved the immediate exercise of warrants to purchase 812,775 shares of common stock, with investors receiving new warrants in a private placement as consideration. These new warrants carry an exercise price of $3.00 per share and will become exercisable following stockholder approval, remaining valid for five years from that date. WallachBeth Capital served as the sole placement agent for the warrant inducement transaction that closed on October 2, 2025.</p><p>This capital infusion arrives at a critical juncture for healthcare technology companies facing increasing demand for digital transformation solutions. Healthcare organizations across hospitals, health systems, payers, and pharmaceutical companies are under mounting pressure to modernize technology infrastructure while maintaining compliance with stringent regulatory requirements. The company's achievement of HITRUST Certification for its Cloud and Data Platform, marketed as CloudEz and DataEz, demonstrates its commitment to maintaining high standards for data protection and information security in the highly regulated healthcare industry.</p><p>The financing provides Healthcare Triangle with additional working capital to pursue strategic initiatives in a competitive market environment. The company's expertise spans cloud implementation, security and compliance, data lifecycle management, and healthcare interoperability solutions, positioning it to capitalize on the growing need for digital transformation in healthcare. The willingness of existing investors to participate in the warrant exercise arrangement suggests continued confidence in the company's business model and growth prospects within the healthcare technology sector.</p><p>For healthcare leaders and technology executives, this development signals ongoing investor interest in companies providing digital transformation solutions to the healthcare industry. The transaction structure, which balances immediate capital needs with long-term investor alignment, could serve as a model for other technology companies seeking funding while maintaining relationships with existing stakeholders. The extended warrant terms provide investors with substantial exposure to the company's potential growth while giving Healthcare Triangle the resources needed to expand its offerings in an increasingly digital healthcare landscape.</p>
