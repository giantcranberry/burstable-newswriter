<p>A group of logistics employees has filed an overtime lawsuit against Trident Transport, LLC, alleging the company misclassified them as exempt from overtime pay and failed to compensate them for hours worked beyond 40 per week. The lawsuit, filed on September 12, 2025, seeks unpaid overtime compensation for Account Managers, Sales Managers, Business Development Representatives, Carrier Sales Representatives, and Capacity Sales Representatives employed by the company anywhere in the United States within the past three years.</p><p>The complaint alleges that Trident Transport, which provides brokerage and freight services, improperly classified these positions as exempt from overtime requirements under the Fair Labor Standards Act. The lawsuit seeks to maintain the case as a collective action, meaning other similarly situated employees could join the case to recover unpaid overtime wages. The legal action requests overtime backpay and double damages for affected workers.</p><p>Michele R. Fisher, one of the attorneys representing the workers from Nichols Kaster, PLLP, emphasized the demanding nature of logistics work. Working in logistics is a demanding job that requires long and varied hours to meet customer needs, Fisher stated. We believe that these employees were misclassified as exempt from overtime pay and are owed additional pay for their overtime worked.</p><p>The case, titled Dennis v. Trident Transport LLC, Case No. 1:25-cv-00297, is proceeding in the Eastern District of Tennessee. Plaintiffs are represented by Michele R. Fisher and Alexandra M. Robinson of Nichols Kaster, PLLP, which has offices in Minneapolis, Minnesota and San Francisco, California. Additional information about the case is available at <a href="https://www.nka.com/tridentcase" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.nka.com/tridentcase</a>.</p><p>This lawsuit highlights ongoing concerns about employee misclassification in the logistics industry, where demanding schedules and customer service requirements often lead to extended work hours. The outcome could have significant implications for how logistics companies classify and compensate their sales and account management staff nationwide.
