<p>Luffa, a decentralized messaging platform built for the fan economy, has appointed Esra Ozturk as its new Head of Product to lead the company's transition from secure messaging to a comprehensive loyalty infrastructure. Ozturk brings extensive experience from major technology companies including Meta, Uber, Zillow, and Instacart, where she built and scaled consumer products across social, marketplace, and commerce platforms.</p><p>In her new role, Ozturk will oversee product strategy and execution as Luffa evolves its encrypted messaging foundation into what the company describes as the next generation of fan-loyalty technology. The platform, designed with end-to-end encryption and creator-first privacy, aims to establish a universal loyalty infrastructure connecting creators, brands, and fans across both digital and real-world experiences. The company's approach begins with direct messaging to build trusted, high-frequency interactions that form the basis for long-term loyalty.</p><p>Ozturk's career includes significant achievements at major technology firms. At Meta, she helped take Instagram Reels from early experiments to global launch. During her tenure at Uber, she led safety and quality initiatives that strengthened marketplace integrity, improved driver earnings, reduced cancellations, and built trust across the platform. Her work at Zillow involved building tools that helped agents and loan officers convert more buyers into funded loans, while at Instacart she led machine learning efforts to detect fraud and reduce unnecessary refunds.</p><p>The new Head of Product emphasized the fragmented nature of contemporary loyalty systems in her statement. The next generation of loyalty won't be owned by any single platform, Ozturk said. Today, loyalty spans creators, brands, live experiences, and digital communities, but it's fragmented. At Luffa, we're starting with secure, decentralized messaging as the backbone, and building toward a portable identity and reward layer that travels wherever fans go.</p><p>Yu Xiong, founding advisor of Luffa, highlighted Ozturk's qualifications for leading the company's next growth phase. Esra's track record of building products people love at global scale, and navigating the complexity of multi-stakeholder platforms, is exactly what we envisioned for this next stage of Luffa's growth, Xiong said. As we expand from encrypted messaging into loyalty and rewards, her leadership will help evolve Luffa into the connective infrastructure linking creators, brands, and fans.</p><p>Luffa recently demonstrated its platform capabilities at CreatorHub Madrid in partnership with UMusic Hotel Madrid, an event that united over 50 global creators and local influencers reaching more than five billion monthly impressions. The activation featured collaborations with Grammy Award-winning artist Joaquina, AI digital artist Tata, and influencers McKenzi Brooke and Adley Kinsman, providing one of the first public demonstrations of Luffa's decentralized messaging layer while previewing upcoming loyalty features.</p><p>Under Ozturk's leadership, Luffa's product roadmap includes scaling its secure messaging infrastructure, introducing its loyalty and rewards layer, and expanding partnerships across entertainment, hospitality, and live events. The company's upcoming loyalty features, currently in beta testing, will expand the messaging foundation into a connected rewards ecosystem for creators and fans, representing a significant shift in how fan engagement and loyalty are managed across digital and physical spaces.</p>
