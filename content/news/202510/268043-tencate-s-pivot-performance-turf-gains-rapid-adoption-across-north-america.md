<p>TenCate's Pivot Performance Turf has achieved widespread adoption across North America less than one year after its official U.S. launch, with installations now spanning 30 states and Canada. The synthetic turf system, developed to replicate the look, feel and performance of natural grass, represents what company leadership describes as the most significant advancement in the synthetic turf industry.</p><p>Joe Fields, President and CEO of TenCate Americas, emphasized the system's transformative nature. "Pivot is the most significant advancement our industry has ever seen. Pivot plays like natural grass, requires no performance infill, lasts longer than conventional turf and can be recycled. It's outperforming the competition, and it's earning trust fast."</p><p>The development process involved extensive real-world testing through TenCate's Center for Turf Innovation. Researchers gathered data from college and professional athletes wearing biosensors while training and competing on Pivot turf, using this feedback to fine-tune the surface for ideal balance of grip, give, stability and speed. This data-driven approach has resulted in a surface that athletic professionals recognize as closely mimicking natural grass conditions.</p><p>Brad Goewey, Athletic Director and Head Football Coach at Centralia High School in Illinois, confirmed the system's natural feel. "It almost feels like you're on Bermuda grass. When you walk on it, it feels similar, and then it plays similar. We're very pleased with the way it's compared to our grass field."</p><p>The environmental advantages of Pivot extend beyond player performance. The system lasts up to 50% longer than conventional turf systems and features full recyclability at the end of its lifespan, supported by an industry-first 12-year warranty. By eliminating the need for performance infill, Pivot requires fewer materials and less energy during installation while substantially reducing plastic shedding since there's no abrasive infill to wear down fibers.</p><p>Environmental safety is another key feature, with the turf containing zero detectable PAHs or lead, meeting California Prop 65 requirements and FIFA, NCAA and NFL testing criteria. Unlike natural grass, Pivot requires no mowing, watering, fertilizing or pesticide applications, significantly cutting emissions, reducing pollution and conserving water resources.</p><p>Dr. Colin Young, Global Director of Research and Development at TenCate, described Pivot as representing a generational shift. "Pivot is more than a new product â€” it's the next generation of synthetic turf. This is the first system that hits all the marks in terms of playability, sustainability and durability."</p><p>The technical specifications support these claims, with Pivot featuring a dense, grass-like surface containing 200% more individual fibers than competitive systems. This is supported by a proprietary blend of TenCate's proven Extended Play (XP) yarns and newly developed fiber technology. Most installations include Pivot Cool, TenCate's non-toxic, mineral-based cooling agent that helps dissipate heat and reduce surface temperatures during warm weather conditions.</p><p>The widespread adoption is documented through a <a href="https://www.playingforkeeps.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">U.S. map on the Playing for Keeps website</a> showing numerous locations that have chosen Pivot for their fields. Fields noted the exceptional market response, stating "Demand for Pivot has taken off because game-changing products like this don't come along very often. The incredible response from programs across the country confirms what we believed all along: Pivot is setting a new standard for synthetic turf."</p>
