<p>The Law Offices of William F. Underwood, III, P.C. has officially changed its name to Underwood Law LLC, marking a significant rebranding that honors the firm's family legacy and decades of service to Albany and surrounding communities. William F. "Trey" Underwood, III, the firm's lead attorney, explained that the name change acknowledges the Underwood family's history of serving Southwest Georgia, beginning with his father William F. "Bill" Underwood, Jr., who founded the practice in 1974.</p><p>"Shortening the name to Underwood Law LLC embodies the lasting legacy of Underwood service to the good people of Southwest Georgia," Underwood stated. "It also reflects the premium my father placed on putting people over profits." Bill Underwood, who established the firm's foundation of community-focused legal service, passed away in 2010, leaving behind a practice built on principles of client-centered representation.</p><p>The firm specializes in workers' compensation and personal injury cases throughout Georgia, having recovered millions of dollars for clients since its establishment nearly five decades ago. The legal team includes trial lawyer and Albany native Ben Haggerty along with attorney Cynthia "Cindi" Deese, both of whom contribute to the firm's mission of providing experienced representation while maintaining a welcoming, hometown atmosphere that distinguishes the practice from larger, impersonal law firms.</p><p>Underwood Law LLC will continue its focus on providing dedicated legal representation and zealous advocacy for clients seeking compensation for workplace injuries and injuries resulting from others' negligence. The firm handles various injury claims including workers' compensation, car accidents, commercial truck accidents, slip-and-fall accidents, premises liability, defective products, medical malpractice, nursing home abuse and neglect, and wrongful death cases. Additional information about the firm's services is available at <a href="https://www.puttingpeoplefirst.law/personal-injury-lawyer/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.puttingpeoplefirst.law/personal-injury-lawyer/</a>.</p><p>The rebranding represents more than just a name changeâ€”it signifies the firm's ongoing commitment to maintaining the values established by its founder while adapting to better serve current and future clients throughout Georgia. This evolution maintains the firm's core identity while positioning it for continued service in the legal community, ensuring that the principles of putting clients first remain central to its practice as it moves forward under the new name.</p>
