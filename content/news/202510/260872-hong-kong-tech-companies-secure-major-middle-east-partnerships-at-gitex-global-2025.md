<p>The Hong Kong Trade Development Council (HKTDC) and Hong Kong Science and Technology Parks Corporation (HKSTP) presented two technology pavilions at GITEX Global 2025 in Dubai, featuring 22 exhibitors demonstrating Hong Kong's capabilities in artificial intelligence, robotics, Internet of Things and green technology. This initiative provided Hong Kong innovation and technology enterprises with crucial access to Middle Eastern markets, resulting in multiple business agreements and partnership discussions.</p><p>Robocore Technology Limited emerged as one of the standout success stories, engaging in advanced discussions with a multinational outdoor advertising company considering global deployment of Robocore's advertising robots. Company CEO Roy Lam reported establishing connections with more than 250 Middle Eastern companies during the five-day exhibition. The company also confirmed plans to sign a Memorandum of Understanding with Omani authorities to establish an AI and Robotics Center in Oman, focusing on localized talent training, certification programs, and cross-departmental pilot projects. Lam noted this marked their fourth international exhibition collaboration with HKTDC this year, following events in Las Vegas, Barcelona, and Paris.</p><p>The HKTDC facilitated additional networking opportunities through a dinner event on October 14, organized in partnership with the Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office in Dubai. Approximately 100 industry representatives from Hong Kong and international markets attended, creating numerous business connection points. Winnie Leung, founder of WYNI Technology, emphasized how the HKTDC bridged the gap between Hong Kong enterprises and Middle Eastern markets by establishing local contacts and connecting companies with regional banks and potential partners.</p><p>Canpanion Group Limited engaged with a local education company during the networking events, exploring integration of their technology into inclusive education programs. The company also established contact with local authorities and received interest from an educational institution about establishing an AI school in partnership with the government. These developments indicate growing recognition of Hong Kong's technological expertise in addressing regional educational needs.</p><p>Concurrent with GITEX Global, the Expand North Star event at Dubai Harbour featured HKSTP's pavilion showcasing innovative solutions from 10 park companies, with participation from The Hong Kong Polytechnic University. The HKTDC continues its strategy of leading Hong Kong businesses to major international technology exhibitions, reinforcing Hong Kong's position as a global innovation hub. Following the success at GITEX Global 2025, the organization plans to organize Hong Kong Tech Pavilions at <a href="https://www.ces.tech" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">CES in Las Vegas</a> in January, <a href="https://www.mwcbarcelona.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">MWC 2026 in Barcelona</a> in March, and VivaTech in Paris, providing continued platforms for technology companies to showcase cutting-edge innovations to global markets.</p>
