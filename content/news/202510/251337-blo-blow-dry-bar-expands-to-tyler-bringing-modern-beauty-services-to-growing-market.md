<p>Blo Blow Dry Bar, North America's original blow dry bar franchise, will open its newest location in Tyler on October 24th at 113 East 8th Street. The new bar represents a significant addition to Tyler's beauty and wellness landscape, offering professional blowout services and makeup artistry in a market experiencing population growth and increasing demand for modern beauty experiences.</p><p>Local entrepreneur Sharie Withers, a longtime Tyler resident and successful business owner, is bringing the franchise to her hometown after experiencing the Blo concept during a visit to Colorado. Withers recognized the opportunity to introduce a contemporary beauty destination to Tyler's growing community. The timing aligns with Tyler's expanding population attracted by the area's low cost of living and vibrant culture.</p><p>The new bar located in Tyler's historic Bergfeld Center will feature five signature hair styles on its menu, a la carte options, various hair treatments, and five signature makeup looks plus customized options. Withers emphasized the welcoming nature of the experience, stating she was blown away by how fun, friendly, and confidence-building the service felt during her initial encounter with the brand.</p><p>For a limited opening period from October 24-26, the Tyler location will offer complimentary blowouts with regular pricing for additional services. The bar is also introducing a founder's rate for its Mane Squeeze Membership, with the first 50 founding members receiving special swag bags at the $75 membership price. Regular blowouts will be priced at $34 through November 23rd.</p><p>Blo Blow Dry Bar operates with a mission to create inclusive spaces where people of all ages, ethnicities, and orientations feel welcomed and represented while emphasizing self-care and wellness. The brand combines sophisticated design with energetic environments to provide seamless experiences from arrival through service completion. Expertly trained stylists, referred to as blo-ers, are available seven days a week for consultations and services.</p><p>The hair menu includes signature styles ranging from sleek and straight to bouncy curls, along with customized looks including updos and braids. Makeup services are provided by expert artists to help guests prepare for any occasion. Operating hours are Monday through Thursday 9 a.m. to 6 p.m., Friday and Saturday 9 a.m. to 7 p.m., and Sunday 12 p.m. to 5 p.m. Additional information about the Tyler location is available at <a href="https://blomedry.com/blo-bergfeld-center/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://blomedry.com/blo-bergfeld-center/</a>.</p><p>Since launching in Canada in 2007 with its no cuts, no color concept focusing exclusively on blowouts, Blo has grown to over 160 locations across the United States and Canada. The brand has evolved to include makeup services, membership programs, and retail products while maintaining its core mission of enhancing community lives through flawless blowouts and beauty services.
