<p>Datavault AI has expanded its wireless audio capabilities through three new solutions from its Acoustic Science Division's Wireless Sound Association. The company introduced the WiSA E Falcon Transmitter Module, WiSA Connect Mobile Application, and WiSA Certification Application, all designed to advance interoperable, high-performance wireless audio technology. This expansion represents a significant step forward in addressing the increasing consumer demand for seamless, premium sound experiences across home entertainment systems.</p><p>The Falcon 5GHz transmitter module delivers uncompressed, low-latency multichannel audio specifically optimized for soundbars, televisions, and home theater systems. This new technology outperforms traditional 2.4GHz Bluetooth solutions with superior RF performance and includes AES 256-bit encryption for enhanced security. The module's capabilities represent a substantial advancement in wireless audio transmission quality for home entertainment applications, potentially setting new industry standards for audio performance and reliability.</p><p>Complementing the hardware innovation, the WiSA Connect mobile application enables users to control and customize WiSA E Certified devices through their home Wi-Fi networks. This software solution provides consumers with greater flexibility in managing their audio systems and personalizing their listening experiences. Meanwhile, the WiSA Certification application streamlines product development and interoperability testing processes for manufacturers, potentially accelerating the adoption of WiSA standards across the industry and fostering greater compatibility between different audio brands.</p><p>CEO Nathaniel Bradley emphasized that this new suite of products positions Datavault AI to meet growing consumer demand for seamless, premium sound experiences. The company also plans to extend its audio technologies into emerging areas including robotics and Web3 applications, indicating broader strategic ambitions beyond traditional audio markets. These developments build upon Datavault AI's existing portfolio of patented technologies, including WiSA, ADIO, and Sumerian foundational spatial and multichannel wireless HD sound transmission technologies.
