<p>tZERO Group, Inc., a blockchain and tokenization pioneer for capital markets, and Archax, the UK/EU-regulated digital asset platform, have announced a strategic partnership to cross-list and distribute digital securities and tokenized real-world assets. The collaboration aims to expand global reach by opening new distribution channels for issuers and broadening access for investors across multiple jurisdictions.</p><p>The partnership will streamline the process for digital securities issuers to list their assets across multiple venues, allowing them to tap into a broader international investor base and access deeper pools of liquidity. Dual listings are expected to boost trading opportunities and liquidity while attracting market makers who add depth through arbitrage and hedging activities. As part of the arrangement, tZERO will become an investor in Archax.</p><p>By connecting two leading regulated marketplaces and custodians - tZERO in the US and Archax in the UK/EU - the partnership strengthens critical infrastructure supporting digital securities worldwide. This addresses a key market need by enabling issuers to reach investors across jurisdictions without traditional geographic barriers and fragmentation. The collaboration also expands access to other platform listings, including tokenized real-world assets like money market funds and structured products.</p><p>Alan Konevsky, CEO of tZERO, emphasized that digital assets can trade 24/7 across borders, noting that real progress depends on stitching together 'follow-the-sun' infrastructure that reduces friction. He stated that Archax represents a key partner in the UK and Europe where regulated digital asset infrastructure aligns with institutional demand. The relationship is central to tZERO's global infrastructure initiatives, laying the foundation for expansion into other regions.</p><p>Graham Rodford, CEO and co-founder of Archax, added that the collaboration demonstrates Archax's commitment to bridging traditional finance and the digital world. Together, the companies are providing issuers with seamless access to international markets while helping investors benefit from enhanced liquidity and connectivity. More information about Archax can be found at <a href="https://archax.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://archax.com</a>.</p><p>As institutional adoption of digital assets accelerates, regulated marketplaces and custodians like tZERO and Archax play critical roles in providing trusted infrastructure. This partnership signals an important milestone in building a more integrated, efficient, and globally connected ecosystem for all aspects of digital securities, with both companies operating as registered entities under regulatory frameworks including <a href="https://www.finra.org" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">FINRA</a> and SIPC protections.</p><p>The strategic alliance represents a significant step toward solving one of the biggest challenges in digital asset markets: fragmentation across jurisdictions. By creating interoperable infrastructure between major financial centers, the partnership enables institutional investors to access digital securities with the regulatory protections they require. This development could accelerate mainstream adoption of tokenized assets while setting new standards for cross-border digital asset distribution.</p><p>For business leaders and institutional investors, this partnership reduces barriers to entry in digital securities markets while providing enhanced liquidity and regulatory certainty. The collaboration between US and UK/EU regulated platforms creates a template for future global digital market infrastructure, potentially transforming how capital markets operate across traditional geographic boundaries.</p>
