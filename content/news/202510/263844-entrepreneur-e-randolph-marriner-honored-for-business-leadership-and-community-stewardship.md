<p>E. Randolph Marriner, a serial entrepreneur who built businesses across multiple industries while serving four governors on Maryland's gaming commission, will be honored by Leadership Howard County for his community stewardship and business leadership. The 75-year-old businessman, who currently focuses on growing a national live events production agency, has been recognized as a steadfast champion of community involvement.</p><p>Marriner's entrepreneurial journey began with a marketing firm in Columbia 20 years ago, followed by ventures in real estate development, restaurants, and the Manor Hill Farm brewery. His current enterprise, Manor Hill Productions, grossed $17 million last year producing major live events for corporate clients including 7-Eleven and AMD. Simultaneously, beginning in 2003, Marriner served under four different governors - two Republicans and two Democrats - on the commission overseeing Maryland's gaming operations, chairing the gaming commission for six and a half years.</p><p>Tim Payne, president and CEO of Leadership Howard County, noted that Marriner earned respect through both success and perseverance. He weathered challenges with grit and grace, always finding ways to help others along the way, Payne said. Marriner's community involvement spans decades of commitment to organizations like the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation and broad civic engagement throughout Howard County and beyond.</p><p>Marriner's political engagement stems from his family's highway construction business, where he learned early that access to decision-makers was crucial for business success. A registered Republican who describes himself as a centrist, Marriner has been a bipartisan donor, contributing over $120,000 to dozens of elected officials from both parties over the past 20 years. His donations have supported Democrats like Senator Guy Guzzone and Governor Wes Moore alongside Republicans like former Governor Larry Hogan and former County Executive Allan Kittleman.</p><p>Marriner attributes his entrepreneurial drive to dyslexia, which he says forced him to look at things differently and find alternative paths to success. Diagnosed later in life, he notes that being placed with the dumb kids in first grade taught him to figure things out differently. He has followed his father's advice to surround himself with smarter people and reward their performance, a philosophy he has applied across his business ventures with his wife Mary and their two daughters.</p>
