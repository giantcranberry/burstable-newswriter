<p>Platinum Group Metals Ltd. is strategically positioned to benefit from a historic surge in platinum prices, which have risen more than 40% in 2025 amid global supply constraints and growing industrial and investor demand. With its flagship Waterberg project in South Africa, the company is advancing production of platinum, palladium, rhodium, gold, copper, and nickel to meet rising needs across multiple industrial sectors.</p><p>Supply disruptions in South Africa, including power outages and refinery maintenance, have contributed to significant output declines, tightening the market just as demand intensifies. This supply-demand imbalance has created favorable market conditions for companies like Platinum Group Metals that are positioned to bring new production online. The company's focus on mechanized, low-cost, and sustainable operations aims to provide a reliable source of critical metals during this period of market tightness.</p><p>The Waterberg Project represents a significant underground palladium and platinum deposit that was discovered by Platinum Group Metals and is being jointly developed with partners Implats, Mnombo and HJM. This collaborative approach to development helps distribute risk while leveraging the expertise of multiple industry participants. The project's advancement comes at a critical time when global supply chains for platinum group metals face multiple challenges.</p><p>Growing demand from automotive manufacturers, hydrogen fuel cell developers, aerospace companies, and defense contractors is driving increased consumption of platinum group metals. Platinum's role in catalytic converters remains crucial for reducing vehicle emissions, while its applications in hydrogen technologies represent an emerging growth area. The company's ability to produce multiple metals from a single operation provides diversification benefits and operational efficiency.</p><p>Investors can access the latest news and updates relating to PLG through the company's newsroom at <a href="https://ibn.fm/PLG" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://ibn.fm/PLG</a>.
