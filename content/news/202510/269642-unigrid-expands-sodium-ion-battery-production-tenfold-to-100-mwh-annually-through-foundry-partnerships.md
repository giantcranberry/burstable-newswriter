<p>UNIGRID has expanded its sodium-ion battery production capacity tenfold to reach 100 MWh per year through strategic foundry partnerships, with projections indicating another tenfold increase to 1 GWh annually in 2026. This expansion responds to escalating global demand for clean, safe, and affordable energy storage solutions that avoid critical materials, perform reliably in extreme temperatures, and minimize fire hazards.</p><p>The company's sodium-ion batteries are specifically designed for motive power and stationary storage applications, featuring safety characteristics that eliminate fire risks during use, transportation, or long-term storage. According to Darren H. S. Tan, CEO and co-founder of UNIGRID, "We've delivered a new generation of safe and high-performance batteries for use cases that can't be served by lithium-ion. From extreme temperatures to fire-sensitive environments, customers are demanding solutions that combine safety, scalability, and operational robustness without the need for thermal management."</p><p>UNIGRID's manufacturing strategy differs from traditional approaches in the battery industry. Rather than raising substantial capital to construct new production facilities, the company leverages existing battery foundries to rapidly scale production and deliver products globally. This approach enables faster market penetration and more efficient resource utilization.</p><p>The capacity expansion coincides with several significant company achievements in 2025. UNIGRID earned UN 38.3 and UL 9540A certifications, meeting internationally recognized safety standards for transportation and deployment. The company secured offtake contracts with global customers for both 12V starter batteries and behind-the-meter storage batteries, indicating strong market acceptance.</p><p>Additional milestones include receiving a $2.9 million California Energy Commission RAMP grant to establish a 12,000 square foot pilot facility in Sorrento Valley, which will enable megawatt-hour scale sodium-ion production. The company was also recognized as one of the top 50 companies on the 2025 San Diego Business Impact Awards list for leadership in clean energy and advanced manufacturing.
