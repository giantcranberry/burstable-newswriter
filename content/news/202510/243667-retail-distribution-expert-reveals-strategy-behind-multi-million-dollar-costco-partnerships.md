<p>Mitch Gould, founder and CEO of Nutritional Products International, has established a track record of securing multi-million-dollar retail partnerships, including seven-figure deals with Costco, the nation's third-largest retailer. With over three decades of retail and consumer goods experience, Gould attributes his Costco success to understanding the company's unique business model focused on delivering value packs of well-known brands at competitive prices.</p><p>Costco's extraordinary growth includes over 900 warehouses globally, with more than 600 locations in the United States, employing over 300,000 people while achieving 2024 net sales exceeding $250 billion. Gould described Costco as a unique retail powerhouse built on loyalty and value, noting that the company's model of offering trusted brands in bulk packs resonates strongly with American households.</p><p>Throughout his career, Gould has cultivated relationships with leading U.S. retailers including Walmart, Home Depot, Lowe's, Walgreens, CVS, and Rite Aid. While initial deals often resulted from in-person meetings, current retailer engagement primarily occurs through major industry events and curated buyer showcases.</p><p>The foundation of NPI's success lies in Gould's Evolution of Distribution platform, a turnkey system designed to help brands navigate all aspects of U.S. market entry from regulatory compliance and logistics to marketing, public relations, and sales execution. Working in conjunction with its sister company InHealth Media, NPI provides comprehensive infrastructure that makes product launches seamless, cost-effective, and efficient for both international and domestic brands.</p><p>Gould emphasized that their mission centers on removing guesswork for brands seeking success in the world's most competitive retail market.
