<p>Play It Again Sports has opened its newest location in Saline, offering athletes of all ages a destination for buying and selling quality used sports and fitness equipment. The store, located at 551 E Michigan Ave, provides football equipment, baseball gloves and bats, hockey gear, golf clubs, soccer gear, lacrosse equipment, treadmills, ellipticals, bikes, weights, and more at accessible prices.</p><p>Local owners Jen and Rick Karcher returned to Michigan after a decade in Florida and identified a need for affordable sporting goods in their community. As parents of three active children and longtime Play It Again Sports customers, they understand the financial challenges families face when purchasing sports equipment. The Karchers plan to partner with local teams, host demo days, and provide discounts to encourage broader participation in sports activities.</p><p>Sports have always been central to the Karcher family, with Rick and their son having professional baseball experience. Jen Karcher emphasized the value of having a local resource that allows families to explore new activities without the high cost or pressure associated with competitive sports. The store's approach makes athletics more accessible to community members of all economic backgrounds.</p><p>The grand opening celebration runs from November 6 through November 9, featuring daily promotions including gift cards for early customers, raffles for sporting equipment, and special discounts. Thursday's events include the first 25 customers receiving $25 gift cards and opportunities to win a Pit-Pat Walking Pad and $100 store gift card. Friday features free Smackin' Seeds for early arrivals and a chance to win a Detroit Lions pop-up canopy tent, while Saturday offers golf equipment raffles and Sunday includes double FiveStars points on all transactions.</p><p>As part of <a href="https://www.winmarkcorporation.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Winmark â€“ the Resale Company</a>, the Saline location contributes to sustainability efforts by keeping sports equipment in circulation rather than sending it to landfills. Unlike traditional consignment stores, Play It Again Sports purchases equipment directly from customers without requiring appointments, providing immediate payment for accepted items. This model supports the company's broader environmental mission while making sports participation more economically feasible for families.</p><p>The store joins over 300 <a href="https://www.playitagainsports.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Play It Again Sports</a> locations across the United States and Canada, all operating under the Play It Again Sports franchise system. Winmark's resale franchises have collectively helped recycle over 2 billion items since 2010, demonstrating the significant environmental impact of the resale business model. The Saline location represents both a business opportunity for the Karchers and a community resource that addresses both economic and environmental concerns in the sporting goods industry.</p>
