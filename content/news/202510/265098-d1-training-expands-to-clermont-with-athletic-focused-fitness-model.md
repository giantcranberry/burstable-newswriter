<p>D1 Training has opened a new facility in Clermont at 2631 S. HWY 27, Suite 101, bringing its athletic-based training methodology to the metro Orlando area. The fitness concept utilizes five core tenets of athletic training and employs certified trainers to help people of all ages achieve their sport and fitness goals. The expansion represents the brand's continued national growth through franchising, with more than 135 performance centers currently open and over 150 additional locations in development.</p><p>New franchisees London Dewey and Ron Zmuda bring local roots and professional expertise to the Clermont location. Both were raised in the metro Orlando area and are University of Florida graduates. Dewey, a former high school athlete who previously worked in chemical engineering, was inspired by her family's entrepreneurial background to start her own business. Zmuda has built his career as a small business attorney while maintaining a passion for fitness. As parents of two young children, they appreciate that D1 Training allows them to participate in the experience while helping others achieve fitness objectives.</p><p>The couple identified a specific need in the local fitness market that D1 Training helps address. "We've always wanted to build something that reflects our passion for fitness and D1 Training helps fill a hole that exists here, when it comes to fitness concepts for kids," said Dewey. "D1 is the perfect fit, not just for us, but for the community. We love that it brings together athletes of all ages, including our own kids, in a space designed for motivation, growth, and performance."</p><p>D1 Training offers four distinct age-based programs: Rookie for ages 7-11, Developmental for ages 12-14, Prep for ages 15-18, and D1 Adult. Each program follows the same five athletic-based tenets: dynamic warm-up, performance, strength program, core and conditioning, and cool down. Beyond group workouts, the facility provides team, semi-private, and one-on-one training with world-class coaches. The comprehensive approach aims to train dedicated athletes regardless of age or athletic background.</p><p>The brand's leadership expressed confidence in the new franchisees' ability to serve the Clermont community. "London and Ron are the ideal candidates to bring the D1 Training experience to Clermont," said Dan Murphy, the brand's Chief Operating Officer. "We're thrilled to welcome them to the D1 family and are confident in their ability to show the Clermont area what they've been missing out on. D1 is a one-of-a-kind fitness experience that's built around the individual and meant to help people meet their athletic goals."</p><p>D1 Training joins a network that includes professional athlete franchisees such as Kylie Fitts and Jordan Gay, along with partners like NBA star Chris Paul and Heisman Trophy winner Tim Tebow. Founded in 2001 by former NFL player Will Bartholomew, the company continues to seek financially qualified business builders, former athletes, and entrepreneurs who share a passion for fitness and youth sports.
