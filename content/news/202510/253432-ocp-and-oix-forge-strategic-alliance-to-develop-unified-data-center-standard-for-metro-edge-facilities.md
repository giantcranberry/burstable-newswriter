<p>The Open Compute Project Foundation (OCP) and OIX Association (OIX) have established a strategic alliance partnership to develop a unified, co-branded open standard for data center facilities. This collaboration harmonizes the OIX-2 data center standard with OCP ReadyTM v2 for hyperscale requirements, with specific focus on metro edge facilities. The initiative aims to simplify implementation and utilization for data center operators seeking to facilitate massive scale interconnection between networks for hyperscale users.</p><p>Eli D. Scher, OIX Vice Chairman of the board, stated that OIX is extremely excited to be co-developing this new open data center standard with OCP. Our organizations are entirely aligned in our common goal of providing the greater Internet community with open access to operational best practices and consensus-developed engineering standards. This new standard will inform all market constituents of the basic requirements to serve hyperscale interconnection on a fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory basis.</p><p>OCP's OCP ReadyTM program continues to shape the future of data center operator facility design at scale and now for the requirements of AI. The initiative began with the creation of OCP ReadyTM v2 for hyperscale data center site assessment that is used by data center service providers to perform detailed self-assessments of their facilities. These assessments ensure facilities meet rigorous standards and requirements set forth by the OCP Data Center Facilities Project, evaluating everything from logistics and site access to base building infrastructure and network connectivity.</p><p>This comprehensive evaluation confirms alignment with hyperscale facility requirements and compatibility with OCP and industry best practices. The program enables colocation providers to market their facilities directly to hyperscale and neocloud audiences through the OCP Marketplace, confident that their data centers meet the specific needs of such customers. With this new alliance, the program will advance by offering a new metro-edge data center site assessment that specifically addresses unique hyperscale network requirements at the metro-edge.</p><p>Mark Dansie, OCP ReadyTM Facilities Lead, emphasized that this collaboration between OCP and OIX will lead to a significant step forward in simplifying and standardizing the assessment of data centers hosting network interconnection at the metro-edge. By harmonizing OIX-2 and OCP ReadyTM v2 for hyperscale with this new recognition, we will empower hyperscale data center operator partners to efficiently support the immense interconnection needs of hyperscale users. The alliance represents a coordinated effort to address the growing demands of hyperscale computing infrastructure in metropolitan edge locations where network performance and reliability are critical.</p>
