<p>Deloitte's 2025 Digital Transformation Report, which typically sets boardroom agendas across industries, highlights three major priorities: AI adoption, cloud migration, and data analytics. However, the report completely overlooks a rapidly escalating revenue operations crisis that is undermining growth initiatives at enterprises investing billions in transformation. While 89% of enterprises invest heavily in digital transformation, most ignore the critical bottleneck killing their growth: a CPQ landscape in complete disarray where legacy systems are dying, promised replacements aren't ready, and customers remain trapped in expensive limbo.</p><p>Global consulting firms like Deloitte serve as trusted advisors for enterprise transformation, yet their frameworks often underestimate the operational realities of revenue generation. In most transformation projects, Revenue Operations receives less than 3% of the total budget despite being the infrastructure that supports every customer interaction and directly impacts revenue recognition, forecasting, and deal velocity. The consequences are severe, with sales teams stuck with slow, error-prone quoting processes, finance leaders lacking visibility into deal data, and customers experiencing friction, delays, and pricing mistakes that erode trust.</p><p>Across industries, CPQ has become the most overlooked weak point in the digital transformation journey. While Deloitte's report paints a picture of AI-driven futures and seamless digital experiences, enterprises struggle with quoting and deal processes that slow sales cycles, alienate customers, and drain margins. Companies face an impossible choice between staying with legacy CPQ systems no longer capable of handling complex business models or moving to unproven replacements like Salesforce Revenue Cloud, which comes with integration risk, uncertain ROI, and high migration costs. Salesforce recently announced the end-of-sale for its legacy CPQ product, forcing thousands of organizations into urgent decision-making cycles.</p><p>DealHub's State of CPQ report shows that without a solid CPQ foundation, AI, cloud, and analytics investments won't deliver expected impact. While consulting firms debate theoretical frameworks, forward-thinking companies are taking practical action. LifeRaft replaced its legacy Salesforce CPQ system with DealHub to eliminate manual work, improve sales-finance alignment, and deliver clearer quotes, resulting in an 80% increase in average selling price. Intuit implemented DealHub in just eight weeks, cutting proposal turnaround times from seven days to 48 hours and scaling to support over 200 sellers without adding unnecessary overhead.</p><p>For executive teams, the implications are stark. CFOs face pressure to produce accurate forecasts but are hamstrung by unreliable CPQ data, while CROs must accelerate sales velocity amid broken quoting workflows and frustrated teams. CEOs betting on digital transformation ROI discover their efforts are built on shaky foundations. When revenue operations are ignored, every other investment delivers diminished returns, creating a dangerous illusion of progress while core systems remain broken. Strategic leaders are moving now to modernize their CPQ stack, protect revenue streams, and create stable foundations for broader transformation rather than waiting for consulting validation.</p>
