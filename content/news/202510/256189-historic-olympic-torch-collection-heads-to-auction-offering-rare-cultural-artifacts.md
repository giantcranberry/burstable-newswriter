<p>A substantial private collection of Olympic torches spanning several decades of Games history will be offered to worldwide bidders in an upcoming auction. The collection includes authentic torches from the 1984 Los Angeles, 2002 Salt Lake City, 2010 Vancouver, and 2014 Sochi Olympic Games, representing significant moments in international sporting history. These limited-production artifacts typically number between 8,000 and 12,000 units per Games, with some editions featuring even smaller production runs, making them increasingly valuable as cultural artifacts.</p><p>Each torch design reflects the cultural and historical identity of its host city while serving as a universal symbol of human achievement and Olympic spirit. The collection's rarity and historical significance are expected to attract interest from art collectors, investors, historians, museums, and universities seeking to preserve these important cultural artifacts. Jeff Schwarz, owner and auctioneer at Direct Auctions, expressed enthusiasm about sharing these historical pieces with collectors who appreciate their significance.</p><p>The collection features full-size used Olympic torches, rare examples signed by Canadian hockey legend Trevor Linden, and items from both Olympic and Paralympic Games including trading cards, torch replicas, medallion replicas, and framed pictures containing pieces of game-used nets. Many items include official provenance, documentation, and photographs that verify authenticity and enhance value, providing collectors with certified historical artifacts.</p><p>The auction, titled Olympic Memorabilia, Collectible Bikes & More Auction, will be hosted live online on Friday, October 24, 2025, beginning at 1:00 PM PDT.
