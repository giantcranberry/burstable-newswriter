<p>The City of Miami's Urban Development Review Board has approved the $2 billion Midtown Park master plan, clearing the way for a transformative five-acre mixed-use community that will reshape Midtown into a vibrant, walkable hub connecting Wynwood and the Design District. Developed by Rosso Development, Midtown Development, and Proper Hospitality, the project represents one of Miami's most significant mixed-use redevelopments and will transform urban living in the area.</p><p>The approved master plan will bring 924 residential units, 60,000 square feet of office space, and over 120,000 square feet of designer retail, anchored by two major public plazas and a network of pedestrian-oriented streetscapes prioritizing walkability and public life. The development will rise across two 28-story towers, two 17-story towers, and a low-rise retail structure, with phased delivery planned over several years. Carlos Rosso, Founder & CEO of Rosso Development, emphasized that the project will transform a long-vacant five-acre site into an activated social hub that seamlessly links the Design District, Midtown, and Wynwood.</p><p>Midtown Park Residences by Proper, located at 3055 N Miami Ave, is the first building within the approved master plan and will deliver 288 Proper-branded residences ranging from studios to three-bedroom homes, plus exclusive penthouses with private rooftop gardens and pools. Designed by Arquitectonica with interiors by Meyer Davis Studio, the 28-story tower will feature 40,000 square feet of private amenities including a tropical pool deck with a signature restaurant and bar, private pickleball court, state-of-the-art fitness center, yoga and meditation garden, spa pool, co-working spaces, a kids club, and a communal vegetable garden designed by Naturalficial.</p><p>The development will also introduce a world-class racquet and padel club featuring 8 courts, operated by ULTRA Padel, with a temporary two-acre ULTRA Padel pop-up set to activate the site as construction begins. Residents will enjoy curated programming and cultural experiences through a Proper Culture Concierge, plus exclusive access to events across Proper Hospitality's global portfolio, including the newly opened Shelborne by Proper on Miami Beach. Iris Escarr√°, Co-Chair of Greenberg Traurig's Miami Land Use practice, noted that having a brand like Proper enter the market represents a tremendous vote of confidence in the neighborhood's continued evolution, solidifying its status as one of Miami's most vibrant and design-forward districts.</p><p>Midtown Park Residences by Proper is exclusively represented by Fortune Development Sales, with pricing starting in the lower $600,000s and completion expected in 2028.
