<p>Angkor Resources Corp. has identified a second drill target for oil and gas exploration on its Block VIII concession in Cambodia, marking significant progress in the company's Cambodian energy initiatives. The company's subsidiary, EnerCam Resources Co. Ltd., confirmed the discovery of a second anticline in the Central Bokor Basin based on analysis of recently completed 2-D seismic data.</p><p>The newly identified Central Bokor Lead features clear four-way closure at depths between 900-1200 meters, similar to the previously identified South Bokor structure. Keith Edwards, Technical Manager for EnerCam, noted that the Central Bokor structure shows hints of East-West faulting and possibly three separate high points within the overall structure. Current seismic coverage provides confidence in a four-way closure covering approximately 60 square kilometers, as detailed in the company's technical documentation available at <a href="https://www.newmediawire.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.newmediawire.com</a>.</p><p>Company CEO Delayne Weeks expressed enthusiasm about the dual discoveries, stating that identifying two anticlines with clear drilling targets exceeds initial expectations from the seismic program. The South Bokor structure covers up to 48 square kilometers of closure, while the Central Bokor structure spans approximately 60 square kilometers, representing substantial exploration targets for the company.</p><p>The ongoing seismic program includes 24 completed lines, with additional processing and interpretation continuing across the entire dataset. The company continues to build its drilling plan as more seismic segments are processed and interpreted, adding scope to the overall geological understanding of the region. This progressive approach allows for continuous refinement of exploration strategies as new data becomes available.</p><p>EnerCam Resources holds an onshore oil and gas license covering just over 4270 square kilometers in southwestern Cambodia after removing parks and protected areas from the original 7300-square-kilometer Block VIII concession. The company's systematic approach to exploration demonstrates the potential for significant hydrocarbon discoveries in Cambodia's underexplored basins.</p><p>The identification of two substantial drill targets in quick succession underscores the prospectivity of Cambodia's onshore basins and represents a meaningful step forward in the country's energy development. As processing continues on remaining seismic lines, the company anticipates further refinement of its exploration strategy and potential identification of additional targets within the Block VIII concession area.</p>
