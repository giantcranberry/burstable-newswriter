<p>Retirees across Iowa are facing uncertainty about their financial preparedness despite years of saving and planning, prompting Retirement Red Flags to host specialized workshops addressing these concerns. The "2025 Annual Retiree Update" workshop scheduled for November in West Des Moines targets retirees who feel mostly prepared but want to identify overlooked risks before significant 2026 changes take effect.</p><p>Nate Crannell, co-founder of Retirement Red Flags, emphasized the workshop's purpose is not to alarm participants but to provide peace of mind through comprehensive financial review. "Most retirees are 95% ready. We help them find the last 5% that can make all the difference," Crannell explained. The educational initiative focuses on practical strategies that can protect retirement savings from hidden risks that quietly erode wealth and confidence during retirement years.</p><p>The workshop curriculum addresses how 2026 tax changes may impact retirement income, Social Security benefits, and estate planning strategies. Participants will learn common mistakes retirees make when drawing income from retirement accounts and simple strategies to protect spouses or heirs from unnecessary taxes and financial risk. The session incorporates real-world stories of retirement planning oversights and provides practical guidance on avoiding similar pitfalls, with resources available through their website at https://RetirementRedFlags.com.</p><p>Scheduled for Tuesday, November 18th from 9am to 12pm and Wednesday, November 19th from 1pm to 4pm at The Venue in Valley Junction, the workshop maintains intimate settings limited to 50 participants per session. This approach facilitates personalized attention and detailed discussion of individual concerns. The $50 registration fee includes a workbook and refreshments, with all proceeds being donated to St. Jude Children's Research Hospital.</p><p>For business and technology leaders, this initiative highlights the growing importance of comprehensive retirement planning in an era of changing tax regulations and economic uncertainty. The workshop's focus on identifying overlooked financial risks demonstrates how proactive financial education can significantly impact retirement security and wealth preservation. As tax laws evolve, such educational programs become increasingly valuable for individuals navigating complex financial landscapes during their retirement years.</p>
