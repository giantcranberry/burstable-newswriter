<p>ClearWater Solutions is elevating industrial pretreatment standards through programs directed by Environmental Engineer Adam Bonomo, addressing a critical niche in environmental compliance that protects municipal infrastructure and water resources. Industrial pretreatment involves the chemical and physical treatment of industrial wastewater before it reaches municipal treatment plants, a highly regulated field that Bonomo describes as complex but essential for protecting infrastructure, treatment plants, water resources, employees, and communities.</p><p>The company operates at the intersection of public utilities and private industry, helping both sectors navigate the intricate landscape of industrial pretreatment. Through its programs, the team develops and manages permits that define what can safely enter municipal wastewater systems, ensuring discharges remain within federal, state, and local pretreatment regulation limits. Bonomo's role encompasses the full spectrum of pretreatment services, from analyzing industrial processes and characterizing waste streams to supporting ongoing compliance, monitoring, and reporting.</p><p>Current projects demonstrate the program's breadth and impact. Bonomo supports Sierra Bullets in Sedalia, Missouri, optimizing their treatment process to achieve effective metal removal and maintain compliance with city-issued permits. On the municipal side, he leads efforts in Ellijay, Georgia, where ClearWater manages the wastewater plant and collaborates with local officials to address challenges at a nearby poultry processing facility, the plant's largest industrial discharger.</p><p>Each situation presents unique challenges, as illustrated by the company's work with the town of Decherd, Tennessee, where Nissan operates its own wastewater treatment system to handle processed water containing heavy metals before discharge. ClearWater oversees these systems to ensure proper functioning and compliance with regulatory limits. With industrial categories such as metal finishing, food manufacturing, and automotive production representing the largest sources of regulated discharges, ClearWater's pretreatment expertise has become increasingly valuable.</p><p>The demand for qualified pretreatment professionals continues to outpace supply, creating opportunities for ClearWater to expand its educational and advisory efforts. CEO Paul Quentel acknowledged Bonomo's contributions, noting that this component of their business is crucial for appropriately managing the overall wastewater process and that the company is ahead of the curve in this arena. Beyond field operations, Bonomo engages in education and outreach, speaking at regional and state-level conferences to help industry professionals understand and navigate the pretreatment process. As he emphasized, We're not just solving today's problems. We're helping clients build the knowledge to prevent tomorrow's.
