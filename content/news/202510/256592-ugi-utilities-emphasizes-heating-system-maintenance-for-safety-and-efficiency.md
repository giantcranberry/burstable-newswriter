<p>UGI Utilities is reminding customers about critical heating system maintenance practices to ensure safety and efficiency throughout the heating season. The utility company emphasizes that proper system maintenance and safety checks are fundamental to delivering safe and reliable energy services during colder months, with several key actions that can make heating systems safer and more cost-effective.</p><p>Professional heating system servicing represents the foundation of winter preparedness. A cleaned and serviced system not only operates properly but can also reduce heating costs significantly. Regular filter maintenance proves equally important, with properly fitted and regularly cleaned or replaced filters significantly impacting both energy costs and indoor air quality. These maintenance practices form the core of efficient heating system operation during peak demand periods.</p><p>The installation of programmable thermostats offers substantial cost-saving potential for homeowners. These devices allow automatic adjustment of home temperatures when residents are away or asleep, thereby lowering heating bills without sacrificing comfort. Chimney and exhaust flue maintenance remains crucial for safety, requiring inspection for damage and checking for holes that could compromise system integrity and create hazardous conditions.</p><p>Proper airflow for appliances represents another critical safety consideration. Furnaces and water heaters located in enclosed rooms or closets require adequate air circulation to function properly and prevent dangerous carbon monoxide buildup. Homeowners should also address air leaks around windows, doors, pipes, recessed lighting, and electrical outlets, as these small openings can collectively lead to significant heat loss and increased heating costs throughout the winter season.</p><p>Maintaining clear air vents ensures efficient system operation, as obstructed vents force heating systems to work harder, resulting in higher energy bills and potential system strain. UGI stresses the importance of verifying that all smoke and carbon monoxide detectors are functioning properly with fresh batteries, recommending placement on every floor and in each bedroom for comprehensive protection. The utility also suggests considering natural gas detectors for additional safety measures in homes using natural gas systems.</p><p>In case of gas odor detection, UGI advises immediate evacuation without turning any electrical devices on or off. The distinctive rotten egg smell added to natural gas serves as a critical warning signal requiring prompt action. After evacuating at least a football field's distance away, individuals should contact emergency services or UGI directly.
