<p>Aura Systems Inc. will present at the Spartan Capital Securities Second Annual Investor Conference on November 3, 2025, at the Marriott Marquis Hotel in New York City. The company's participation highlights the conference's focus on innovative growth companies positioned for long-term market leadership.</p><p>The company has developed and commercialized axial flux induction technology for electric motors and generators, representing a significant departure from traditional radial flux designs that dominate current industrial and commercial applications. This technology is the result of decades of electromagnetic research and more than $150 million in development investment.</p><p>Aura's axial flux induction motors offer several critical advantages over conventional designs, including complete elimination of rare earth or any permanent magnets, reducing dependency on foreign supply chains particularly from China. The technology uses 60% less copper than equivalent traditional radial flux induction motors while achieving higher energy density and requiring fewer overall materials.</p><p>According to company specifications, Aura's motors demonstrate higher efficiency than traditional radial flux designs and equal efficiency to the best rare earth permanent magnet machines, all while maintaining lower production costs than both radial flux and permanent magnet alternatives. The flat shape, reduced weight, and compact construction make these motors suitable for diverse applications including pumps, compressors, HVAC systems, fans, food processors, power generation turbines, and electric vehicles, boats, and planes.</p><p>Cipora Lavut, President and chair of Aura Systems Inc., stated that the conference offers an unparalleled platform to highlight the company's progress and connect with new investors. Spartan Capital Securities Founder and CEO John D. Lowry expressed enthusiasm about featuring Aura Systems, noting that the conference brings together high-quality issuers and serious capital providers under one roof.</p><p>The event, organized in partnership with B2i Digital, will showcase more than 60 carefully selected companies across technology, healthcare, consumer, mining, precious metals, and other high-growth sectors, with over 500 institutional and high-net-worth investors expected to attend. David Shapiro, CEO of B2i Digital, emphasized the strategic importance of Aura Systems' participation, stating that their involvement supports B2i Digital's core mission of combining digital marketing reach with face-to-face investor engagement.
