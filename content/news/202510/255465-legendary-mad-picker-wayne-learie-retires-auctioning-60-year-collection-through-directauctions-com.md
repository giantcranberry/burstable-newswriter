<p>The retirement of Wayne Learie, known professionally as The Mad Picker, marks the end of a 60-year career that established him as a trusted expert among collectors and antique enthusiasts across Canada and internationally. Learie built his reputation discovering hidden gems in basements, backyard sheds, and estates, specializing in everything from rare gas pumps and vintage signs to celebrity memorabilia like Led Zeppelin's robe. His sharp eye for the unusual and extraordinary made him a sought-after expert for building collections for investors and private collectors.</p><p>The upcoming auction features more than 2,000 rare and collectible pieces, with standout items including a 1938 historically significant local carving depicting Chief August Jack Khatsahlano of the Squamish Nation. The carving represents a piece of West Coast history, featuring a leader instrumental in preserving Squamish Nation oral history and collaborating with Vancouver's early settlers. Chief Khatsahlano is documented in the book Conversations with Khahtsahlano 1932-1952 by early Vancouver City Archivist J.S Matthews.</p><p>Other notable pieces include highly collectible early Canadian Addison radios from the 1950s, an original mint-condition "Girl on the Beach" Coca-Cola sign, a fully restored Austin children's pedal car, and a signed Tiffany table lamp and candle holder. The collection also features Hardy fishing reels and rods from the 1920s and '30s, rare Canadiana furniture, carved Chinese jade, fine jewelry, sterling silver, Indigenous art, military swords and badges, and restored Seeburg and Wurlitzer jukeboxes.</p><p>Jeff Schwarz, owner of <a href="https://bid.directauctions.com/Wayne-Learie-s-Incredible-Antique-Store-Personal-Collection-Auction_a74880?m=all" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">DirectAuctions.Com</a> and known as "The Liquidator" from television, expressed excitement about the collaboration. "It's been an honor and a privilege to work with Wayne over the years," Schwarz said. "We're thrilled to present such a unique collection that rarely, if ever, comes up for auction." The acquisition of The Mad Picker business allows DirectAuctions.Com to expand further into the estate and collectibles market.</p><p>The two-day live online auction will be hosted by both Learie and Schwarz and streamed worldwide, allowing international participation in what is expected to be the most significant auction event in the Fraser Valley in 25 years.
