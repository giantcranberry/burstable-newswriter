<p>MindWalk Holdings Corp. (NASDAQ: HYFT) has received board authorization for a share repurchase program that will allow the company to buy back up to 2.3 million common shares over the next 12 months. The program, which represents approximately 5% of the company's 46.15 million outstanding shares, is scheduled to begin on October 15, 2025. This corporate action signals management's belief that current market valuation may not fully reflect the company's long-term potential.</p><p>Chief Executive Officer Jennifer Bath stated that the repurchase initiative demonstrates the company's confidence in its long-term growth trajectory and strategic direction. The program is designed to provide flexibility for share repurchases when market prices diverge from the company's assessment of intrinsic value. Funding for the purchases will come from existing cash reserves, investment portfolios, or future operational cash flows.</p><p>MindWalk operates as a bio-native artificial intelligence company focused on transforming drug discovery and development processes. The company's technology platform centers around its patented HYFT technology and LensAI platform, which integrate sequence, structure, function, and literature data into a unified computational framework. This approach enables the company to close the innovation loop through an integrated, full-stack wet lab capability. Additional information about the company's operations and technology can be found at <a href="https://www.ipatherapeutics.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.ipatherapeutics.com/</a>.</p><p>The company's platform supports multiple advanced applications in pharmaceutical development, including rapid epitope mapping, de novo molecular design, in silico vaccine exploration, and population-scale biologics analytics. These capabilities help accelerate the transformation of scientific insights into validated drug candidates, potentially reducing the traditional 10-15 year drug development timeline.</p><p>The share repurchase announcement was distributed through AINewsWire, a specialized communications platform focusing on artificial intelligence advancements and innovations. AINewsWire operates as part of the Dynamic Brand Portfolio at IBN, providing comprehensive corporate communications solutions including wire distribution, media syndication, and social media outreach. More details about the distribution platform are available at <a href="https://www.AINewsWire.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.AINewsWire.com/</a>.</p><p>For investors and industry observers, this repurchase program represents a significant vote of confidence in MindWalk's bio-native AI approach to pharmaceutical innovation. Such programs are typically viewed as shareholder-friendly initiatives that can enhance earnings per share and return value to investors while demonstrating confidence in the company's financial stability and future prospects. The move suggests that management believes the market has not fully priced in the potential of their integrated AI-driven drug discovery platform, which could have substantial implications for the broader pharmaceutical industry's approach to research and development.</p>
