<p>Vision Marine Technologies Inc. continues to demonstrate leadership in marine electrification with its E-Motion™ 180E-powered vessel now holding the world record for the fastest electric boat. The record was set at the annual Lake of the Ozarks Shootout in Missouri, where VMAR's craft reached an astonishing speed of 116 mph, surpassing its own previous record of 109 mph set in 2022. This enduring achievement underscores Vision Marine's commitment to innovation and excellence in the electric marine industry.</p><p>We're in a bold new development and training phase, and Vision Marine is becoming the reference in America for electric boating, said VMAR CEO and cofounder Alexandre Mongeon. When we broke the record, we proved that electric boating can compete at the highest levels of performance. Today, that same technology is validated and available to customers through Florida's strongest dealer platform. The company's performance edge remains significant, with Mongeon noting they remain faster than 80% of ice boats at the Ozarks while building a sustainable foundation that creates lasting value for investors.</p><p>Vision Marine Technologies epitomizes the marine industry's shift toward electric propulsion, offering the pioneering E-Motion™ outboard powertrain system. This innovative technology represents a significant leap forward in marine propulsion, combining advanced battery packs, inverters and high-efficiency motors with proprietary software and assembly techniques. The company's commitment to eco-friendly electric powerboats is reshaping the recreational boating experience, offering higher speeds, longer ranges and smoother rides than traditional internal combustion engine boats.
