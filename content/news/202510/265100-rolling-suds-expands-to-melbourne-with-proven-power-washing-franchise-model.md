<p>Rolling Suds, America's leading power-washing franchise, will open its newest location in Melbourne on October 27, bringing specialized cleaning services to local homeowners and businesses. The franchise, located at 2280 Avocado Ave, Unit 6, offers tailored cleaning solutions designed to extend asset lifespan, reduce tenant turnover, and protect long-term property value.</p><p>The new location is owned by entrepreneur Devin Hollenbaugh, whose diverse background includes leadership roles at The Walt Disney Company and the U.S. Army Contracting Command in Germany. After returning from overseas, Hollenbaugh launched Lightfoot Logistics LLC through Amazon's DSP program, growing the operation to more than 100 drivers before deciding to establish deeper roots in Florida with his family.</p><p>"After years of moving around, it feels good to be back in Florida and building something that directly serves our neighbors," said Hollenbaugh. "Rolling Suds gives me the chance to apply what I've learned over the years in a way that helps local families and businesses take pride in their properties."</p><p>To celebrate the opening, Rolling Suds will host a ribbon-cutting ceremony on October 29 at 4:30 p.m. with the local Chamber of Commerce. The event will feature yacht rock music, refreshments, and an opportunity for guests to enter for a chance to win a pair of Rolling Suds bubble socks.</p><p>The franchise brings a proven business model backed by more than 30 years of industry experience to the Melbourne market. One of Rolling Suds' key differentiators is its ability to complete jobs two to three times more quickly than competitors through a proprietary cleaning process that utilizes high-quality materials and specific soap dilutions. The company employs state-of-the-art equipment and highly trained professionals, creating a sustainable business that can reinvest in itself.</p><p>Rolling Suds is built on three core elements: relationships, reputation, and reliability, which apply to both consumers and franchisees. In an unregulated industry, Rolling Suds franchisees can differentiate themselves through a recession-resistant business model and comprehensive support system. This includes a nine-week interactive power launch training program, one week of in-person training, six months of lead generation, and digital marketing support handled by the corporate team.</p><p>For more information about Rolling Suds Melbourne, visit <a href="https://www.rollingsudspowerwashing.com/melbourne-palm-bay-fl/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.rollingsudspowerwashing.com/melbourne-palm-bay-fl/</a>.</p>
