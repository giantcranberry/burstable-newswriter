<p>Mantra Softech has received the Certificate of Recognition for Outstanding Contribution to Innovation in Biometric Authentication Solutions from the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI). The certificate was presented by Shri Bhuvnesh Kumar, IAS – CEO, UIDAI, together with the UIDAI leadership team, to Mr. Hiren Bhandari, Director – Technical, and Mr. Bhavyen Bhandari, Director – Project, during the fourth Aadhaar Samvaad hosted by UIDAI in Hyderabad. This recognition highlights Mantra Softech's development of the most accurate spoof detection technology in biometrics, setting a new benchmark in secure identity management.</p><p>Biometric authentication has become integral to India's digital identity infrastructure, powering secure access for millions across government, banking, telecom, and enterprise ecosystems. As adoption has grown, so have threats from fraudulent attempts using fake fingerprints, silicone molds, digital projection, and paper projection. These pose serious challenges to biometric system integrity. Mantra Softech dedicated significant R&D resources to developing a solution that could accurately detect and prevent spoofing attempts in real time.</p><p>The technology that earned this recognition fortifies biometric systems against sophisticated attacks through AI-powered liveness detection. Deep learning models trained on extensive datasets can distinguish between real and fake biometric traits by analyzing texture, depth, and reflectivity. The system meets international standards for Presentation Attack Detection through <a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/67381.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">ISO/IEC 30107 PAD Compliance</a>, ensuring global relevance and reliability. Spoof attempts are flagged instantly, enabling fast authentication for high-volume environments, and the system works across fingerprint, iris, face, and palm biometrics.</p><p>Mantra Softech has achieved several national and global firsts, including India's First iBeta Certification for Iris Sensors, validating the company's commitment to world-class compliance. The company established India's First Spoof Lab in Ahmedabad, a dedicated facility for testing and benchmarking presentation attack detection, reinforcing India's self-reliance in biometric R&D. Most notably, Mantra developed ASIM (Anti-Spoofing Intelligence Multi-biometric System), a unified AI model trained for face, fingerprint, and iris spoof detection representing the world's first Spoof Large Model.</p><p>The recognition at Aadhaar Samvaad underscores Mantra Softech's alignment with the Government of India's Digital India mission, emphasizing secure, inclusive, and technology-driven growth. UIDAI's endorsement validates the company's role in safeguarding the Aadhaar ecosystem and supporting the vision of a trusted digital society. These milestones ensure biometric authentication remains resilient against evolving threats while supporting the nation's mission for a secure, future-ready ecosystem.</p><p>Applications of Mantra Softech's spoof detection innovations extend beyond Aadhaar to industries relying on secure identity verification. Banking and fintech benefit from preventing fraudulent account openings and strengthening transaction security. Telecom enhances subscriber KYC processes with fraud-proof biometric checks. Government services secure Aadhaar-linked programs, subsidies, and welfare distribution. Aviation and border security provide robust, real-time passenger identity verification. Enterprise security ensures trusted workforce management and logical access control.</p><p>With deployments in over 40 countries, Mantra Softech continues investing in multimodal authentication, AI-driven identity intelligence, and cloud-native security frameworks, reinforcing India's reputation as a hub for advanced digital identity technologies. The UIDAI recognition represents both a milestone in Mantra Softech's journey and a springboard for future innovation in biometric security.</p>
