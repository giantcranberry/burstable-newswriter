<p>IndeXr, a subsidiary of Moon Equity Holdings Corp., has introduced an AI-as-a-Service private cloud solution that leverages SoftIron HyperCloud technology to significantly improve energy efficiency for organizations implementing artificial intelligence infrastructure. The service, delivered through IndeXr's Master Reseller partnership with SoftIron, enables complete private AI cloud deployments that can reduce power consumption by up to 80% compared to conventional systems while requiring less physical space.</p><p>The announcement comes amid growing industry concerns about the environmental impact and operational expenses associated with AI infrastructure expansion. According to company documentation, SoftIron HyperCloud nodes consume substantially less power and require reduced cooling compared to alternative systems, with field deployments demonstrating appliances drawing up to 80% less power versus comparable configurations. Customers have reported measurable improvements in energy efficiency while simultaneously reducing rack footprints, positioning the technology as particularly relevant as AI workloads continue to proliferate across multiple sectors.</p><p>Steve Marshall, CEO of Moon Equity Holdings, highlighted the critical importance of energy efficiency in AI implementation. "We are directly addressing the obvious elephant in the room with AI. Energy efficiency must be the starting point," Marshall stated. "By pairing IndeXr's services with SoftIron's purpose-built private cloud, we're giving customers a faster, cleaner way to stand up AI - with an average of 5x more performance per watt, less waste, and complete control over where data lives."</p><p>The service combines rapid deployment capabilities with enterprise-grade control, supporting on-premises implementations with full chain-of-custody including U.S. manufacturing provenance. Deployment can typically be completed within days, with initial installations often occupying less than half a standard rack space. Fixed-price packages are structured to minimize integration risks for organizations transitioning from legacy infrastructure systems.</p><p>As SoftIron's Master Reseller, IndeXr can deliver HyperCloud as either branded or white-label services, encompassing comprehensive design, deployment, and managed operations. The channel-friendly packaging supports government agencies, enterprises, managed service providers, and public institutions seeking predictable energy consumption and operating profiles with reduced thermal signature.
