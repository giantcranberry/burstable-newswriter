<p>The Go Fund Yourself program on Cheddar TV continues to redefine startup funding by blending television exposure with public investment opportunities. Episode 11, airing October 16 at 7PM ET, will showcase two distinct startups addressing different market needs: Chop Chop in restaurant technology and NAQI in neural interface development.</p><p>The show's model represents a significant shift from traditional pitch competitions by inviting public participation through investment portals. Rather than focusing solely on judge approval, Go Fund Yourself measures success through market validation and community backing. This approach attracts founders seeking traction alongside capital and investors who value market visibility as much as valuation.</p><p>Chop Chop addresses a critical challenge facing independent restaurants: third-party delivery platforms charging up to 30% commissions per order. The company offers a subscription-based delivery solution that eliminates commission fees while providing restaurants with direct customer relationships and data ownership. In a post-pandemic landscape where delivery has become essential, this model represents economic protection for local eateries competing against corporate chains. The investment opportunity for Chop Chop is available at <a href="https://invest.fundinghope.com/offering/chop-chop/details" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://invest.fundinghope.com/offering/chop-chop/details</a>.</p><p>NAQI represents a different frontier of innovation with its neural-earbud platform that enables hands-free device control through cognitive signals. The non-invasive technology requires no screens, touch, or implants, positioning the company at the forefront of human-machine interaction. Potential applications span accessibility technology, gaming, and productivity enhancement, translating human intent directly into digital commands. Investment information for NAQI can be found at <a href="https://invest.naqilogix.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://invest.naqilogix.com</a>.</p><p>The show features Titans Rory Cutaia, David Meltzer, and Jayson Wallerâ€”accomplished CEOs and investors who provide strategic insight beyond funding decisions. Their evaluations offer commercial rigor and insight into capital movement trends. As one Titan noted, the show invests in companies that can redefine what's possible rather than just products.</p><p>Go Fund Yourself continues to scout for new ventures, with application information available at <a href="https://gofundyourself.show/#apply" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://gofundyourself.show/#apply</a>.
