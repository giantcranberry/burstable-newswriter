<p>D1 Training has opened a new facility in Bellaire at 5300 N. Braeswood Blvd, Suite 44, bringing its athletic-based training concept to the community under the leadership of former collegiate athletic training professionals Hans and Jen Straub. The fitness franchise employs a sports-science backed training regimen led by certified trainers designed to help people of all ages achieve their sport and fitness goals.</p><p>Hans Straub brings over 20 years of collegiate strength and conditioning experience from coaching positions at the University of San Diego, University of Washington, and Stanford University, where he served as the top assistant Sports Performance coach for football and later as Director of Olympic Sports Performance. His professional background includes work at the University of South Florida before joining Rice University, where he was the head of strength and conditioning for the past seven years. Throughout his career, Hans has trained 65 NFL players, including six first-round picks like Houston's Andrew Luck, and 50 professional baseball players including five first-round picks, along with 10 Olympians including gold medalist Simone Manuel.</p><p>Jen Straub contributes valuable experience in the health and fitness space, having worked as an athletic trainer at Stanford for five years and at the University of Oklahoma for two years. After relocating to South Florida, she transitioned to a clinical setting, taking on a managerial role with professional background spanning primary care, orthopedics, and fertility. We were drawn to D1 because it truly operates like a family, said Jen. With our new location, we will help youth athletes grow, develop, and reach their full potential.</p><p>The Straubs join the growing roster of D1 franchisees that includes former professional athletes like NBA star Chris Paul and Heisman Trophy winner Tim Tebow. D1 Training offers four age-based programs including Rookie (ages 7-11), Developmental (ages 12-14), Prep (ages 15-18) and D1 Adult. Each fitness program is based on the five athletic-based tenets: dynamic warm-up, performance, strength program, core and conditioning, and cool down.</p><p>Outside of group workouts, D1 Training offers group, semi-private, and one-on-one training with world-class coaches. The goal is to continue to train athletes who are dedicated to their sport or fitness goals, regardless of age or athletic background. Strategically expanding across the nation through franchising, D1 Training has more than 150 facilities open with over 100 additional locations in various stages of development.</p><p>Founded in 2001 by former NFL player Will Bartholomew and based in Nashville, D1 Training is positively impacting the lives of 30,000 athletes of all ages.
