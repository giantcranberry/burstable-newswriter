<p>Silver Crown Royalties Inc. has completed the final tranche of its silver royalty agreement with PPX Mining Corp. for the Igor 4 project in Peru, solidifying a 15% stake in the cash equivalent of silver produced from the mining operation. The company paid US$637,000 to PPX Mining to finalize the royalty arrangement, which now covers 225,000 ounces of silver in total.</p><p>The completion of this final payment increases Silver Crown's royalty by 3.9% to reach the full 15% entitlement. According to the royalty agreement dated December 13, 2024 and amended on July 31, 2025, the total payable silver ounces under the royalty increased by an additional 58,500 ounces. To date, PPX has delivered 2,247 ounces of silver to Silver Crown from this arrangement.</p><p>Peter Bures, Silver Crown's Chief Executive Officer, emphasized the strategic importance of this development. The PPX silver royalty together with the recently closed financing positions us to reach positive free cash flow in 2026 without the need to access the capital markets for working capital purposes. We only expect to raise capital for specific new royalties during the foreseeable future.</p><p>The Igor Project represents a significant asset in Peru's Northern Peru gold belt, located in the eastern La Libertad Department. PPX Mining Corp., a Canadian-based mining company, maintains 100% ownership of the Igor project, which contains both gold and silver deposits. The completion of this royalty agreement strengthens Silver Crown's portfolio, which currently includes five silver royalties.</p><p>This transaction demonstrates the growing importance of royalty agreements in the mining sector, providing companies like Silver Crown with exposure to precious metals production while mitigating operational risks associated with direct mining activities. The arrangement allows Silver Crown to benefit from silver production at the Igor Project while PPX retains operational control and development responsibilities.</p><p>The royalty model offers investors exposure to precious metals commodities while providing a natural hedge against currency devaluation and production cost inflation. Silver Crown's business strategy focuses on minimizing economic burdens on mining projects while maximizing shareholder returns through carefully structured royalty agreements like the one finalized with PPX Mining.</p>
