<p>The Supervisory Board of FORTEC Elektronik AG has resolved to realign the Company's Executive Management to strategically and technologically position FORTEC to sustainably secure its competitiveness in an increasingly dynamic market environment. This management restructuring follows an ad hoc announcement published on October 6, 2025, regarding personnel changes in the Management Board and represents a critical response to recent market challenges that have forced the company to adjust its forecasts multiple times.</p><p>The Supervisory Board will conduct a structured process to identify suitable candidates who will further develop the FORTEC Group in a market-oriented manner, setting a clear strategy for the future and establishing a long-term perspective for the coming years. Christoph Schubert, Chairman of the Supervisory Board of FORTEC Elektronik AG, emphasized the company's financial position while acknowledging market challenges. FORTEC Elektronik AG maintains a solid financial foundation with an equity ratio of approximately 72% and net financial assets of just under EUR 20 million as of March 31, 2025, providing stability during this transition period.</p><p>The supervisory board's primary objective is to appoint a new Management Board that will help FORTEC regain a clear strategic direction and reposition itself in line with market requirements, thereby laying the foundation for sustainable growth. During the transition period, Ulrich Ermel will manage the Company's day-to-day operations. To ensure stability and operational capability of the FORTEC Group during this transition phase, the Supervisory Board will provide Ermel with experienced interim support for the areas previously overseen by Sandra Maile, whose departure was acknowledged with appreciation for her many years of service.</p><p>FORTEC Elektronik AG, founded in 1984 as an international distributor of standard solutions in power supplies, embedded systems and displays, has evolved to offer customer-specific developments and complete system developments. Since April 2020, FORTEC Elektronik AG has served as the holding company responsible for management of affiliated companies, group strategy and essential administrative functions. The company maintains subsidiaries in Germany, Switzerland, the UK and the USA, with its corporate information available at <a href="https://www.fortecag.de" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.fortecag.de</a>.</p><p>This management realignment represents a critical step for FORTEC as it navigates an evolving electronics distribution landscape, where technological advancements and market dynamics require agile leadership and strategic vision to maintain competitive positioning and drive future growth initiatives across its international operations. The move signals FORTEC's commitment to adapting to changing market conditions while leveraging its strong financial position to implement necessary strategic changes that will position the company for long-term success in the competitive electronics distribution industry.</p>
