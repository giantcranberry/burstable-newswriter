<p>Healthcare Triangle, Inc. has executed warrant exercise agreements with existing accredited and institutional investors that will generate approximately $755,000 in immediate funding for the digital healthcare solutions provider. The transaction involves the exercise of outstanding warrants for 377,702 shares of common stock at a reduced price of $2.00 per share, down significantly from the original $20.92 exercise price.</p><p>In exchange for the immediate exercise of these existing warrants, investors will receive new warrants providing the right to purchase an equal number of shares at $3.00 per share. These new warrants become exercisable immediately upon issuance and maintain their validity for five years, creating long-term investment opportunities while providing the company with current capital infusion. The complete transaction, including both the exercise of existing warrants and issuance of new warrants, is scheduled to occur on October 6, 2025.</p><p>The financial implications extend beyond the immediate $755,000 gross proceeds, as the company could receive additional funding if investors exercise the newly issued warrants. WallachBeth Capital is serving as financial advisor for this warrant inducement transaction, bringing specialized expertise to the complex financial restructuring. This capital raise occurs as Healthcare Triangle continues to expand its digital transformation services for healthcare organizations, hospitals, health systems, payers, and pharmaceutical companies.</p><p>Healthcare Triangle's technological offerings include CloudEz™ and DataEz™ platforms, both achieving HITRUST Certification for Cloud and Data Platform, demonstrating the company's commitment to data protection and information security standards. The company's focus on healthcare interoperability, clinical optimization, and business performance enhancement positions it within a rapidly evolving digital healthcare landscape where secure data management and cloud solutions are increasingly critical.</p><p>This warrant restructuring represents a strategic financial maneuver that provides immediate working capital while maintaining investor engagement through new long-term investment instruments. The transaction structure allows the company to access needed funds without traditional equity dilution concerns, potentially supporting continued development of the company's healthcare technology platforms and services detailed at <a href="https://www.healthcaretriangle.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.healthcaretriangle.com</a>.</p>
