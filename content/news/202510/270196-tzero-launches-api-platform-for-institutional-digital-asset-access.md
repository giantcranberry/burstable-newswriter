<p>tZERO Group, Inc. announced the launch of tZERO Connect, an initiative providing institutions and fintech partners with direct, programmable access to the company's regulated infrastructure for digital securities and tokenized real-world assets. The API-first platform represents a strategic move to facilitate institutional B2B and B2B2C partner access to tZERO's blockchain-powered infrastructure.</p><p>The platform offers several key capabilities including tokenization and issuance APIs that enable partners to conduct compliant digital securities offerings directly within their own platforms. Secondary trading APIs, scheduled for late 2025 or early 2026, will power order routing, market data access, and post-trade automation for tokenized assets. Data APIs provide access to trade information, order book depth, and best bid/offer data for real-time analytics integration.</p><p>tZERO Connect enables white label access for supply and demand partners, including broker-dealers, custodians, and fintechs, to embed tZERO infrastructure directly into their existing environments. The platform operates through a follow-the-sun network connecting global market leaders and infrastructure innovators such as <a href="https://alphaledger.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Alphaledger</a>, <a href="https://archax.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Archax</a> and Lynq to expand access to compliant tokenized markets worldwide.</p><p>The infrastructure is built atop tZERO's SEC- and FINRA-regulated broker-dealer, alternative trading system (ATS), and special purpose broker-dealer for digital custody, with pending CFTC DCO/DCM applications. This regulated core provides institutional-grade compliance, security, and transparency for partners integrating tokenized asset functionality.</p><p>Alan Konevsky, CEO of tZERO, stated that the company's mission is to make it simple for institutions to access the benefits of tokenization in a robust cross-asset and cross-border marketplace. tZERO Connect allows partners to plug directly into the ecosystem, bringing tokenized securities to investors within their existing applications and bridging traditional and digital market infrastructure.</p><p>The platform's global collaboration model connects best-in-class partners across custody, settlement, and jurisdictions, extending the reach of compliant digital asset infrastructure worldwide. Konevsky emphasized that APIs serve as the connective tissue of modern financial markets, combining an API-first approach with partnership strategy across supply, demand, global rails, DeFi connectivity, institutional services, and public markets innovation.</p><p>Through tZERO Connect, institutional partners can offer clients compliant digital asset capabilities without requiring investors to leave their native applications. Partners maintain full control of their client experience while leveraging tZERO's regulated entities for underlying brokerage, clearing, and custody functions. This approach potentially accelerates the integration of tokenized assets into mainstream financial services while maintaining regulatory compliance.</p>
