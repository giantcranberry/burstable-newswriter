<p>The Managing Board and Supervisory Board of Pentixapharm Holding AG have jointly resolved to significantly reduce early-stage research and development activities and concentrate resources on the company's most advanced clinical programs. This strategic prioritization allows Pentixapharm to invest more effectively in its most value-generating development programs, including the Phase 3-ready CXCR4 flagship program for the improved diagnosis of treatment-resistant hypertension.</p><p>This decision represents a continuation of the clinical development strategy introduced in May 2025, which prioritizes high-value CXCR4-targeted programs. The sharpened focus includes an adjustment of the organizational structure, accompanied by a targeted workforce reduction of approximately 50% at Pentixapharm AG. Implementation is anticipated to be completed in the first quarter of 2026.</p><p>The organizational adjustments are expected to lower annual operating costs and extend the company's cash runway through the first quarter of 2027. These measures mark a targeted continuation of the clinical development strategy outlined earlier this year, focusing the company's resources on programs with the greatest potential for near-term clinical advancement and value creation.</p><p>Dr. Dirk Pleimes, CEO and CMO of Pentixapharm AG, emphasized the importance of the Phase 3-ready PentixaFor CXCR4 program for the diagnosis of treatment-resistant hypertension, which has made significant progress in recent months and remains a central value driver. Our Phase 3-ready PentixaFor CXCR4 program for the diagnosis of treatment-resistant hypertension has made significant progress in recent months and remains a central value driver, showcasing Pentixapharm's clinical development expertise, Pleimes stated.</p><p>Optimizing our operational costs is an important step to enhance the company's efficiency and lay a solid foundation for achieving the next clinical milestones, he added. While the adjustment of our organizational structure was a carefully considered decision, it is essential to safeguard the company's long-term value and support sustainable growth. We will implement the measures responsibly and support our employees throughout the transition period.</p><p>Pentixapharm develops precision diagnostics and therapeutics in oncology and cardiology to transform patient care. Its clinical pipeline is anchored by CXCR4-targeted PET-CT programs, including a Phase 3-ready candidate for the improved diagnosis of hypertensive patients with primary aldosteronism, which is intended to enable targeted treatment of the underlying causes of hypertension. The company's developments also include pioneering therapeutic programs in hematological cancers and a next-generation antibody platform targeting CD24, an emerging immune-checkpoint marker over-expressed in multiple hard-to-treat cancers.
