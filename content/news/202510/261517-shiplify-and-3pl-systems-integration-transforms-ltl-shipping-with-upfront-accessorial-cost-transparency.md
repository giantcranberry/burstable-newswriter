<p>The transportation technology landscape has shifted with the announcement of a strategic integration between Shiplify and 3PL Systems that addresses long-standing challenges in less-than-truckload shipping. The partnership embeds Shiplify's location intelligence directly into 3PL Systems' BrokerWare platform, enabling users to identify costly accessorials at the point of quote rather than after shipment booking.</p><p>LTL freight has historically presented significant pricing challenges for brokers and shippers alike. Residential deliveries, limited access locations, and liftgate requirements often go unnoticed during the quoting process, leading to billing disputes, eroded profit margins, and frustrated customers. The integration automatically flags and maps these details upfront, ensuring that brokers see carrier-specific charges instantly within their existing workflow.</p><p>North Winship, President of Shiplify, emphasized the transformative nature of this development. By embedding Shiplify's location and accessorial insights directly into 3PL Systems, brokers using BrokerWare finally have access to delivery transparency at the point of quote. This advancement means fewer unexpected fees, faster wins, and protected margins, all achievable without ever leaving the BrokerWare environment.</p><p>For 3PL Systems, the integration reinforces the company's philosophy of delivering comprehensive solutions within a single intuitive platform. BrokerWare already unites LTL and truckload operations across rating, dispatch, tracking, and accounting functions. The addition of Shiplify's capabilities provides users with enhanced competitive positioning in the complex LTL market. Michael Sternberg, Director of Sales at 3PL Systems, noted that everything brokers need should exist in one intuitive system, and the Shiplify integration strengthens this approach.</p><p>The immediate availability of this integration for all 3PL Systems BrokerWare customers represents a significant step forward in freight management technology. By removing guesswork from LTL quoting, the partnership empowers brokers to win freight with greater confidence while protecting margins and delivering enhanced transparency to shippers. This transformation turns what was traditionally a liability in freight management into a strategic advantage for brokers navigating the competitive transportation landscape.</p><p>The implications extend beyond immediate cost savings to potentially reshape how the industry approaches LTL quoting altogether. The ability to identify and account for accessorial charges upfront could reduce billing disputes that have long plagued carrier-shipper relationships. As the transportation industry continues to evolve toward greater digitization and transparency, this integration sets a new standard for how technology partnerships can address persistent operational challenges while driving efficiency and profitability across the supply chain.</p>
