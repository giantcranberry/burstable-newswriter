<p>Maestra.io has launched its Shopify Loyalty App, providing direct-to-consumer brands with the capability to deploy fully featured loyalty programs in minutes while seamlessly syncing first-party data into cross-channel marketing journeys. The Maestra Companion App allows brands to launch personalized rewards and promotions effortlessly, showcase challenges to earn points, and provide loyalty at checkout where shoppers can redeem points for personalized promo codes immediately before payment.</p><p>The launch strengthens Maestra.io's position as a leading alternative to Klaviyo for brands generating between $10 million and $100 million in revenue. The fast-growing startup is on track to achieve $4 million in annual recurring revenue and has expanded its team to more than 30 employees across customer success, sales, and engineering departments. Trusted by brands including Sena, Selkirk Sport, The Adventure Challenge and Bokksu, Maestra.io is rapidly gaining traction in the competitive marketing technology landscape.</p><p>Customer results demonstrate the platform's effectiveness, with Urban Armor Gear achieving a 64% cost reduction by consolidating its marketing stack and realizing immediate $100,000 in savings. Nick Salisbury, E-commerce Director at Urban Armor Gear, noted that the platform upgrade improved their marketing flows, amplified abandoned cart notifications, and added post-purchase sequences while providing AI recommendations that are understandable and controllable rather than operating as a black box algorithm.</p><p>The ease of deployment, combined with Maestra's powerful Customer Data Platform, allows direct-to-consumer brands to go live faster and personalize every customer interaction across email, SMS/MMS/RCS, web, mobile push and messaging platforms. Maryna Hradovich, COO and Co-Founder of Maestra, explained that as marketing databases scale and retention becomes mission-critical, teams are outgrowing point tools and seeking unified solutions. The platform consolidates loyalty, referrals, promotions and omnichannel messaging into a single flow builder, eliminating tool sprawl while providing the personalization power and white-glove service brands need to grow profitably.</p><p>Maestra.io's platform is designed to unify customer data and personalize every touchpoint beyond email and SMS, delivering omnichannel messaging, native loyalty and referral systems, personalization across site, product, and price, and advanced analytics. The company serves prominent brands including Quiksilver, JBL, Nespresso, United Colors of Benetton, Tefal, Panasonic, Miele, L'Or√©al, Birkenstock, Marco Polo, Under Armour, and Gap, setting a new standard in direct-to-consumer marketing technology.
