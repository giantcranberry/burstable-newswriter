<p>Noble Mineral Exploration Inc. has entered into an agreement to sell its Island Pond claims in Newfoundland & Labrador to Benton Resources Inc., marking a strategic consolidation within the Great Burnt Copper-Gold Project area. The transaction involves seven mining claims covering approximately 175 hectares in Central Newfoundland, strategically positioned north of Benton's existing South Pond Gold Zone.</p><p>Under the terms of the agreement, Noble will receive 1,000,000 common shares of Benton and a $30,000 cash payment for the property. The shares will be subject to the standard four-month hold period required by TSX Venture Exchange policies. More detailed information about Noble's operations and holdings is available through their corporate website at <a href="https://www.noblemineralexploration.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.noblemineralexploration.com</a>.</p><p>Noble will retain significant ongoing interest in the property through a 1% net smelter returns royalty that is not subject to any buyback rights. However, Benton maintains a right of first refusal over any proposed sale of this royalty by Noble. The property also remains subject to a pre-existing 2% net smelter returns royalty from previous agreements.</p><p>H. Vance White, Noble's CEO, commented on the transaction, stating "We wish to congratulate Benton on the success they have had to date on the Great Burnt and look forward to results in the future. Noble will retain a 1% NSR on the 7 mining claims being sold subject to a right of first refusal to Benton."</p><p>The closing of this transaction remains contingent upon several conditions, including approval from Noble's Board of Directors and any required approvals from the TSX Venture Exchange. This transaction represents a strategic realignment of assets within the region, allowing Benton to consolidate its holdings in the Great Burnt Copper-Gold Project while providing Noble with immediate financial consideration and long-term royalty exposure to the property's potential development.</p><p>This sale reflects the ongoing consolidation trend in the mining sector, where junior exploration companies strategically divest non-core assets to focus on their primary projects while maintaining exposure through royalty arrangements. The retention of the net smelter returns royalty provides Noble with potential future revenue streams without requiring additional capital investment in the property's development.</p><p>For business leaders and investors in the mining sector, this transaction demonstrates the strategic value of royalty structures in resource development. The arrangement allows Noble to monetize assets while preserving upside potential through the 1% NSR royalty, creating a balanced approach to capital allocation and risk management. This model could influence similar transactions across the industry as companies seek to optimize their portfolios while maintaining exposure to promising mineral projects.</p><p>The consolidation of the Great Burnt Copper-Gold Project under Benton's management may accelerate development timelines and improve operational efficiencies. For technology professionals monitoring the mining sector, this transaction highlights how strategic asset management and financial engineering can create value beyond traditional exploration and development activities. The royalty-based approach represents an innovative financial structure that could become more prevalent as mining companies seek to balance immediate financial needs with long-term project exposure.</p>
