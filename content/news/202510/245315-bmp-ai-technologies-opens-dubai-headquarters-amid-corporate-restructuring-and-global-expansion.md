<p>BMP AI Technologies Inc., formerly known as NeuralBase AI Ltd., has opened a new regional headquarters in Dubai as part of its global expansion strategy focused on advancing enterprise artificial intelligence and blockchain technologies. The Dubai office will serve as a regional hub for research, development, and client engagement across healthcare, fintech, education, and government sectors, positioning the company to capitalize on the Middle East's emergence as a global innovation center.</p><p>Vighnesh Dobale, Chief Executive Officer of BMP AI Technologies Inc., emphasized the strategic importance of the Dubai location, stating that "Dubai's ecosystem offers unmatched access to global talent, forward-thinking regulation, and a gateway between Europe, Asia, and Africa." The physical presence in Dubai enables closer collaboration with regional partners and accelerates deployment of the company's next-generation AI and blockchain products to broader markets.</p><p>Concurrent with its geographic expansion, the company is undergoing significant corporate restructuring. On July 24, 2025, the Board of Directors approved changing the company name from NeuralBase AI Ltd. to BMP AI Technologies Inc. to better reflect its expanding technological focus and global operations. Additional corporate action includes a 5-for-1 forward stock split declared on September 9, 2025, with a record date of September 26, 2025.</p><p>Both corporate actions require approval from the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, with Dobale noting that the name change application is in "final stages of receiving FINRA clearance" and expected within days. Upon name change effectiveness, the company will request FINRA to declare a payment date for the stock split.

The Dubai expansion represents a strategic move to access growing Middle Eastern markets while the corporate changes signal maturation and rebranding as a global technology provider.</p><p>For business leaders and technology executives, this development signals the increasing globalization of AI and blockchain companies seeking to establish footholds in emerging innovation hubs. The Middle East's growing technology ecosystem, particularly in Dubai, presents new opportunities for enterprise technology partnerships and market expansion.
