<p>Critical Infrastructure Technologies Ltd. has been selected as a Rover within the Team Defence Australia industry delegation for the Association of the United States Army Annual Meeting and Exposition 2025, scheduled for October 13-15 at the Walter E. Washington Convention Center in Washington, D.C. The AUSA Annual Meeting ranks among the world's largest land warfare events, gathering global defense leaders, government representatives, and industry innovators to display next-generation technologies.</p><p>Participation in the Team Defence Australia delegation provides CiTech with a strategic platform to engage with international defense stakeholders and strengthen relationships with global partners. The company will highlight its Nexus platform and integrated technologies that support mission-critical communications, mobility, and situational awareness. This international exposure comes at a crucial time as defense organizations worldwide seek advanced autonomous solutions for rapidly deployable communications infrastructure.</p><p>Brenton Scott, CEO of CiTech, stated the company is honored to represent Australia's defense industry at AUSA 2025 alongside Team Defence Australia. This opportunity allows the company to showcase its Nexus platform to a global audience and continue expanding international partnerships focused on innovation, capability enhancement, and allied collaboration. The AUSA 2025 event is expected to host over 30,000 participants, including senior military officials, international delegations, and key defense contractors.</p><p>CiTech's involvement in the delegation reinforces its commitment to advancing sovereign capability and promoting Australian innovation on the global stage. The company's technology targets multiple sectors including mining, defense, border security, surveillance, and emergency services. Its self-deploying platform addresses two significant limitations of current rapidly deployable communication solutions: tower strength and the ability to rapidly self-deploy and operate in various situations. The platform supports radio equipment including LTE and other technological payloads such as surveillance and anti-drone systems.
