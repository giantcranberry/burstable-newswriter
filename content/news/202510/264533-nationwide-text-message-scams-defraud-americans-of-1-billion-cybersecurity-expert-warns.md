<p>Frequency Holdings CEO Rick Jordan appeared on NewsNation Prime to analyze a Wall Street Journal report detailing a $1 billion nationwide text message scam that has defrauded Americans through fake toll notifications and other mobile fraud schemes. Jordan, whose cybersecurity subsidiary ReachOut Digital Intelligence focuses on digital protection, described how criminal organizations have evolved their tactics to become more sophisticated than traditional cybersecurity threats.</p><p>Cybersecurity today isn't just about firewalls or software, it's about human awareness, said Jordan during the six-minute segment. These criminal groups operate like corporations, using precision targeting, grammar-checked messages, and emotional triggers to manipulate people. My mission, and ReachOut's, is to protect Americans and small businesses from exactly this kind of threat.</p><p>The interview highlighted how geo-targeted smishing attacks have become increasingly sophisticated, leveraging human behavior and social engineering to bypass traditional security measures. Jordan emphasized that these criminal operations function with corporate-level precision, making them particularly dangerous to consumers who may not recognize the sophisticated nature of the scams.</p><p>Jordan called for stronger accountability from major mobile carriers and greater consumer choice in mobile protection services, stating he would gladly pay a few dollars a month to stop these attacks before they ever reach a phone. This position reflects growing concerns about the responsibility of telecommunications providers in preventing fraudulent messages from reaching consumers.</p><p>This national media appearance continues Jordan's ongoing presence across major U.S. media outlets including Bloomberg, FOX Business, Cheddar, CBS News, and NewsNation, where producers frequently invite him to explain complex cybersecurity issues for mainstream audiences. His plainspoken approach to translating emerging cyber threats into actionable insights has made him a go-to commentator for both consumer and enterprise cybersecurity concerns.</p><p>Being trusted by national networks to interpret billion-dollar cyber issues is a reflection of the same trust our clients place in us, added Jordan. Every public appearance strengthens the Frequency and ReachOut brands as reliable defenders in a digital world that's getting noisier - and more dangerous - by the day. The increased visibility positions Frequency Holdings and its cybersecurity subsidiary as credible forces in the evolving landscape of digital protection and AI-driven defense systems.</p>
