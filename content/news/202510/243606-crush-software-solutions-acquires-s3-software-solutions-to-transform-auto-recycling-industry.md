<p>Crush Software Solutions LLC has acquired S3 Software Solutions LLC, the developer of Crush, the largest yard management system used by more than 200 self-service auto recycling yards across the United States and Canada. The acquisition positions the combined entity to significantly impact how independent auto recyclers operate and compete in the evolving automotive marketplace.</p><p>The ownership group, led by individuals with deep roots in auto recycling including the family offices of Tom D. Klauer Jr. and Kendig K. Kneen, is committing an additional $3 million to reengineer the platform. This investment aims to add new capabilities and return buying power to independent yards. Between Klauer and Kneen, they have operated over 70 yards during the last three decades, bringing substantial industry experience to the venture.</p><p>We have learned by operating our own yards that we can use the Crush software to teach our buyers to buy inventory that will yield far better results and thereby far more profits, Klauer said. The acquisition will accelerate the roadmap for Crush 2.0, with the company's goal being to double the platform's footprint to over 400 yards by delivering a modern, cloud-hosted, enterprise-ready system.</p><p>The enhanced system will focus on improving vehicle sourcing, pricing, and sales processes for independent operators. Independent operators deserve technology that works for them. We are building Crush 2.0 to give yards more control over buying, inventory and margin, Klauer emphasized. The investment will modernize the platform and remove friction from daily operations so teams can focus on throughput and customer experience.</p><p>For current customers, the transition promises continuity with enhanced capabilities. For current customers, nothing changes immediately. No disruption. Same highly secure platform. More investment, said Dimitri Gerontis, founder of S3 Software Solutions who will serve as chief operating officer of the combined company. This is an exciting time for the Crush community. The new funding lets us move faster on features, strengthen security and boost performance.</p><p>The Crush 2.0 improvements will include complete re-engineering of the software with modern cloud architecture, data-driven vehicle acquisition, integrated marketplace connections, and enterprise-grade analytics and security. The company's near-term focus includes customer listening sessions, a transparent roadmap and early-access pilots in select markets.</p><p>Ryan Paterson, a technology leader with more than 20 years in federal and commercial markets, will serve as chief executive officer. The leadership team combines extensive auto recycling experience with technological expertise, positioning the company to transform how self-service auto recyclers operate in an increasingly competitive landscape.</p>
