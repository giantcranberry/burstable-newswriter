<p>Steve Catalano, a commercial real estate industry veteran with over 45 years of experience, has joined Friend Commercial Real Estate to continue providing brokerage services for his established client base. Catalano, first licensed in 1977, joins Friend from Commercial 100, a Prince George's County based real estate brokerage he founded in 1989. Throughout his distinguished career, Catalano has completed over $170,000,000 in commercial transactions encompassing both sales and leasing.</p><p>His achievements include being recognized earlier in his career as the number one salesperson in Prince George's County by the Prince George's County Board of Realtors for his commercial real estate sales volume. Joseph Friend, founding partner and broker at Friend, expressed enthusiasm about the addition. We are thrilled to welcome Mr. Catalano to Friend Commercial Real Estate, Friend said. You'd be hard-pressed to find someone with comparable transactional experience and years under his belt. Steve brings not only deep market knowledge and a loyal client base, but also a reputation of success â€“ he's inherently a winner.</p><p>Friend emphasized Catalano's impact on the industry, noting that Steve shaped and continues to define the role of a commercial real estate agent/broker in Maryland. His contributions to the evolution of our local economies would be historic if it wasn't for his best work being yet to come. Steve's addition further strengthens our presence across Maryland, and we're excited to see the continued success he'll bring to our growing team. Catalano expressed his own excitement about the move, stating I'm excited to join Friend Commercial Real Estate. I've long been familiar with Friend's strong market presence and stellar reputation.</p><p>Their experienced team and comprehensive in-house resources provide the ideal platform to continue delivering exceptional results for my clients. Beyond his commercial practice, Catalano brings additional industry leadership credentials to his new role. He served as past President and Board of Director for the Maryland/DC CCIM Chapter and earned his CCIM designation in 1986, demonstrating his long-standing commitment to professional excellence in the commercial real estate field.
