<p>ESGold Corp. has signed a binding term sheet with Ocean Partners UK Ltd. for a Prepayment and Working Capital Facility of up to C$9 million to support completion of its Montauban Gold-Silver Project in Quebec and provide working capital. The facility will be drawn in two tranches aligned with Phase 1 and Phase 2 production timelines, with repayment structured through dore deliveries under an offtake agreement that commits Ocean Partners to purchase 100% of Montauban's gold and silver output.</p><p>The financing arrangement represents a crucial milestone for ESGold as it advances toward anticipated production in 2026 at its flagship Quebec project. The company's Montauban Project is currently under construction and represents a significant development in Quebec's mining sector. The facility is subject to standard conditions and due diligence, but the commitment from Ocean Partners provides substantial financial backing for the project's completion.</p><p>ESGold describes itself as a fully permitted, fully funded, pre-production mining company advancing a scalable clean mining model across North and South America. Beyond the Montauban Project, the company is also advancing a joint venture in Colombia, validating one of South America's most prolific gold regions for tailings reprocessing and systematic exploration. The company maintains a dual-track strategy of pursuing cash flow from near-term production while continuing exploration for future discoveries.</p><p>Additional information about ESGold Corp. is available through their corporate website at <a href="https://esgold.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://esgold.com</a>, where investors can access past news releases, a 3D model of the Montauban processing plant, and other corporate resources.
