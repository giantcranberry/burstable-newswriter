<p>SouthernMED Pediatrics has integrated Sunshine Pediatrics into its operations, expanding its presence in Rock Hill effective October 15, 2025. The merger brings Sunshine Pediatrics' 20-year legacy of community care under the SouthernMED umbrella while ensuring Dr. Raj Patel and the existing Sunshine team remain on staff indefinitely. This strategic move represents a significant expansion of pediatric services for Rock Hill families, who will now benefit from SouthernMED's statewide network and enhanced service offerings.</p><p>Patients will maintain relationships with their familiar healthcare providers while gaining access to expanded resources including telemedicine options, behavioral health and counseling services, and online appointment scheduling through SouthernMED Pediatrics' comprehensive platform. The integration demonstrates how healthcare consolidation can enhance patient services without disrupting established provider-patient relationships, a model that could influence similar mergers in the pediatric healthcare sector.</p><p>Dr. Kyle Guyton, Co-Founder of SouthernMED Pediatrics, emphasized the importance of the integration for community healthcare. "Sunshine Pediatrics has built a remarkable reputation for delivering compassionate care for more than 20 years," Guyton stated. "We are honored to welcome Dr. Patel and the dedicated Sunshine team into the SouthernMED family. Together, we will continue providing exceptional care while expanding access and services to meet the needs of Rock Hill's growing families."</p><p>The expanded services include new weekday hours from 8:00 AM to 5:00 PM with a lunch closure from 12:00 PM to 1:00 PM, while maintaining Saturday morning visits for family convenience. The practice will continue operating from its established location at 724 Arden Lane, Suite 100, ensuring minimal disruption for existing patients. This approach to maintaining physical location and key staff during integration provides a blueprint for successful healthcare mergers that prioritize patient experience.</p><p>Dr. Raj Patel of Sunshine Pediatrics highlighted the benefits for both patients and providers. "Joining SouthernMED allows us to build on the foundation we've created in this community," Patel shared. "Our patients can expect the same personal care and smiling faces they already know, now supported by the expanded resources of SouthernMED Pediatrics." The integration strengthens SouthernMED's mission to deliver comprehensive, family-centered pediatric care to medically underserved communities across South Carolina. As part of US Pediatric Partners, SouthernMED continues to expand its network while maintaining its patient-first approach to healthcare delivery.</p>
