<p>Gurobi Optimization, a leader in decision intelligence technology, has announced a new partnership with GRID, an AI optimization company specializing in infrastructure solutions. This collaboration merges GRID's expertise in AI and digital twins with Gurobi's advanced solver technology to address growing optimization demands in energy and social infrastructure sectors.</p><p>The partnership aims to achieve several key objectives, including high-speed resolution of complex combinatorial optimization problems in power supply and demand, vessel scheduling, and transportation planning. It also focuses on optimization simulation using digital twins that precisely replicate real-world operations, with deployment across power and energy, shipping and logistics, and urban transportation sectors. Additional goals include skill standardization through automation of planning operations traditionally dependent on expert experience and intuition, along with cost reduction through improved operational efficiency.</p><p>GRID, which transitioned from renewable energy to AI optimization, was selected for NEDO's startup support program and successfully listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange Growth Market in 2023. The company leverages digital twins and deep learning to predict and optimize complex planning operations, including power generation facility scheduling and transmission network routing, contributing to infrastructure efficiency and decarbonization efforts. More information about GRID's services can be found at <a href="https://gridpredict.jp/en" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://gridpredict.jp/en</a>.</p><p>Ryosuke Umeda, CTO of GRID Inc., stated that through the partnership with Gurobi, the company will further evolve prediction and optimization solutions to deliver greater value to customers. Duke Perrucci, CEO of Gurobi Optimization, expressed confidence that with GRID as a partner, mathematical optimization technology can be extended to more customers across social infrastructure and other critical industries. The combination of GRID's advanced AI and machine learning technologies with Gurobi's optimization technology will support the creation of more innovative solutions.</p><p>Gurobi Optimization, founded in 2008, enables customers to make optimal business decisions in seconds across various applications including workforce scheduling, portfolio optimization, and supply chain design. The company serves customers in nearly all industries, including organizations like SAP, Air France, and the National Football League. Additional details about Gurobi's decision intelligence technology are available at <a href="https://www.gurobi.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.gurobi.com/</a>.</p><p>This partnership represents a significant advancement in addressing complex optimization challenges facing critical infrastructure sectors. The integration of digital twin technology with advanced optimization solvers could lead to substantial improvements in operational efficiency, cost reduction, and decarbonization efforts across multiple industries. For business leaders in energy, logistics, and transportation sectors, this collaboration signals the emergence of more sophisticated tools for managing complex operational challenges while supporting sustainability goals through improved resource allocation and planning optimization.</p>
