<p>The entrepreneurial television series Go Fund Yourself returns for its fourth season on Cheddar TV, continuing its mission to connect startups with investors, buyers, and mentors through national television exposure. The season premiere spotlights two growth-stage companies addressing critical global challenges: securing America's mineral independence and building sustainable agricultural systems.</p><p>Patriot Critical Minerals, based in Nevada, is developing the largest SEC-compliant tungsten resource in the United States at a time when global supply chain volatility makes domestic mineral production strategically important. Tungsten serves essential roles in defense, aerospace, and clean energy industries where supply chain reliability directly impacts national security and economic competitiveness. A company spokesperson emphasized that developing stable domestic tungsten sources represents both business opportunity and national interest, aiming to reduce American dependence on foreign imports while supporting advanced manufacturing and renewable energy applications. The company will present its case to millions of viewers and potential investors through the show's platform at <a href="https://invest.patriotcritical.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://invest.patriotcritical.com/</a>.</p><p>Sharing the spotlight in the season premiere is Opti-Harvest, a California agricultural technology company pioneering climate-smart farming solutions. The company's patented Opti-Filter system helps farmers harness sunlight more efficiently to boost crop yields while conserving water and reducing labor requirements. As climate pressures and labor challenges intensify across agriculture, the company's founder noted that farmers increasingly need technologies that enhance productivity while conserving resources. Opti-Harvest's light optimization approach aligns with global food security initiatives and sustainable farming practices, attracting interest from institutional investors and sustainability-focused funds.

The show features established business leaders serving as Titans who provide mentorship and potential funding, including series creator Rory J. Cutaia, serial entrepreneur Jayson Waller, and investor David Meltzer. This combination of national visibility and expert guidance has proven valuable for previous participants, with many alumni securing capital and partnerships following their appearances.</p><p>The series provides emerging companies with immediate credibility and exposure beyond typical startup platforms, offering access to Cheddar TV's substantial audience along with follow-up investor opportunities and media amplification. Cutaia described the show as a launchpad for serious founders prepared to scale their ventures, emphasizing the program's focus on connecting innovators with appropriate partners, investors, and customers in real time. Previous seasons have featured entrepreneurs from diverse sectors including consumer technology, clean energy, aviation, and healthcare, with many leveraging their television exposure to accelerate subsequent growth phases.</p>
