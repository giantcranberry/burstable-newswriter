<p>Frequency Holdings Inc. (OTC: FRQN) has opened a new Manhattan office through its cybersecurity subsidiary ReachOut Digital Intelligence, marking a strategic expansion into the Northeast small and mid-size business market. The new location at 80 Broad Street in New York's Financial District positions the company blocks from Wall Street and key financial, legal, and technology institutions, providing immediate access to one of the world's most concentrated business ecosystems.</p><p>The expansion follows several new customer contracts secured in the New York metropolitan area, reflecting growing demand for scalable, subscription-based cybersecurity platforms. This move signals a significant shift in the cybersecurity landscape where SMBs increasingly require enterprise-level protection without the traditional enterprise-level complexity and cost structure. The timing is particularly relevant as businesses of all sizes face escalating cyber threats and regulatory pressures.</p><p>ReachOut's approach combines SaaS solutions with 24/7 security monitoring and expert human response capabilities. The company's proprietary SaaS protection platform is powered by AI and backed by human expertise, designed specifically for growing enterprises that need comprehensive protection but lack the resources for large internal security teams. This hybrid model addresses a critical gap in the market where purely automated solutions often miss sophisticated threats, while fully manual approaches prove cost-prohibitive for smaller organizations.</p><p>Rick Jordan, Chief Executive Officer of ReachOut and Frequency Holdings, stated that the Manhattan office represents more than just a new address but signals the company's intent to become a nationwide force in SMB cybersecurity. The location in what Jordan described as the world's business capital provides the footprint and presence needed to deliver enterprise-grade protection with the agility of a trusted partner. This expansion reflects a broader industry trend where cybersecurity providers are recognizing the unique needs of the SMB segment, which has historically been underserved despite facing similar threats as larger corporations.</p><p>The new office will provide localized sales, customer engagement, and technical support throughout the Northeast region while strengthening brand presence among SMBs seeking cybersecurity and technology solutions. The expansion also supports Frequency Holdings' broader strategy of acquiring and integrating local managed service providers, scaling them through ReachOut's platform. Company filings with regulatory authorities can be reviewed at https://www.sec.gov for additional financial and operational details, providing transparency for investors and stakeholders monitoring the company's growth trajectory.</p><p>The building at 80 Broad Street features 36 floors with approximately 420,000 square feet of office space in an Art Deco tower with modern amenities and strong transit access. Jordan emphasized that the expansion represents a meaningful milestone in Frequency Holdings' evolution, building infrastructure, security, and identity with disciplined operational execution. The move comes as businesses increasingly seek comprehensive cybersecurity solutions that combine technological sophistication with human oversight and localized support, particularly in regulated industries like finance and legal services where the consequences of security breaches can be catastrophic.</p>
