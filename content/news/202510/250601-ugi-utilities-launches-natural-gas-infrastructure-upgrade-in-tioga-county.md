<p>UGI Utilities, Inc. has launched a natural gas main replacement initiative along Route 249 near Middlebury Center in Tioga County, representing a substantial infrastructure enhancement designed to maintain safe and dependable service for the community. The project involves replacing aging gas mains between Hughes Road and Button Hollow Road as part of UGI's comprehensive strategy to modernize its distribution network across its service territory.</p><p>Construction operations are scheduled Monday through Friday from 7:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., with completion of the new natural gas main installation anticipated by late November. During this period, motorists should expect lane restrictions along Route 249 that may result in traffic delays. The project also necessitates temporary interruptions to natural gas service, requiring UGI personnel to access properties for equipment inspection and service restoration procedures to ensure proper reactivation of gas service.</p><p>Following the main installation, immediate temporary restoration of work areas will occur, with final paving scheduled for a subsequent date. These system improvements demonstrate UGI's proactive infrastructure maintenance approach, addressing potential safety considerations while enhancing service reliability for the thousands of customers who depend on natural gas in the region. UGI Utilities, Inc. serves more than 760,000 customers across its service territory, and additional information about the company and its operations is available at <a href="https://www.ugi.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.ugi.com</a>.</p><p>The strategic timing of the project during autumn months aims to minimize community disruption while completing essential infrastructure enhancements before winter weather conditions develop. Residents and businesses in the affected area should prepare for temporary service interruptions and coordinate with UGI representatives when property access is required for service restoration activities. The company emphasizes that these infrastructure upgrades are critical for maintaining the integrity of the natural gas distribution system and preventing potential service disruptions in the future.</p><p>For business leaders and technology professionals monitoring infrastructure developments, this project highlights the ongoing necessity of utility infrastructure modernization and the careful planning required to balance community impact with essential system improvements.
