<p>Lincoln Property Company has acquired a 191,000-square-foot data center in Chandler, Arizona, with plans to develop the facility's vacant space and implement cooling system improvements that could save up to 3 million gallons of water monthly. The property at 2500 W. Frye Rd. sits within the Price Road technology corridor and offers 28MW of confirmed utility power served by an on-site Salt River Project substation.</p><p>The facility currently features four data center halls, one of which is fully leased to a Fortune 500 enterprise user. Lincoln plans to fit out the remaining three halls, adding 16MW of critical capacity with an initial 4.2MW targeted for delivery in early Q1 2026. The company will transition the project from an evaporative cooled to air cooled mechanical system, creating significant water conservation benefits for the City of Chandler.</p><p>Ryan Sullivan, Lincoln Property Company Executive Vice President and National Data Center Group Leader, noted that Arizona's unprecedented demand from hyperscale, enterprise and neocloud users has pushed local data center vacancy to record lows. This facility will add critical turnkey capacity with immediately available utility power, addressing the region's supply constraints. The acquisition marks Lincoln's return to the Frye Road property, which the company previously owned from 2018 to 2019.</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.cbre.com/insights/figures/us-data-center-figures-q1-2024" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">CBRE research</a>, metro Phoenix ranks as the nation's fourth largest data center market, with steady demand and absorption pushing vacancy rates below 2%. The Frye Road facility adds to that constrained inventory at a time when the Phoenix market faces significant supply limitations.</p><p>David Krumwiede, Lincoln Property Company Senior Executive Vice President, emphasized the company's commitment to setting performance standards for tenants and the Chandler market. The site is planned for additional development that was approved by the City of Chandler as part of a development agreement initiated by the property's previous owner. The Frye Road facility expands Lincoln's metro Phoenix footprint to 23.2 million square feet of owned and managed space across various commercial projects.</p>
