<p>ESGold Corp is featured in a NetworkNewsAudio segment examining how inflation and currency volatility are driving renewed investor interest in miners and metals. The segment titled "When the Dollar Blinks, Real Assets Take Center Stage" highlights that miners-focused ETFs have attracted strong inflows as institutional investors reassess earnings power and valuation multiples across the sector.</p><p>The company's tailings-first strategy at its Montauban project in Quebec positions it to capitalize on this environment, offering a low-capex, high-margin model that aims to generate early cash flow while minimizing dilution risk. These traits are increasingly being rewarded in a strengthening metals cycle according to market analysts. ESGold's approach represents a shift toward more efficient resource extraction methods that can deliver returns more quickly than traditional mining operations.</p><p>ESGold Corp is a fully permitted, preproduction resource company at the forefront of clean mining and exploration innovation. With proven expertise in Quebec, the company is advancing its projects toward production and feasibility while delivering long-term value through sustainable resource recovery and exploration.
