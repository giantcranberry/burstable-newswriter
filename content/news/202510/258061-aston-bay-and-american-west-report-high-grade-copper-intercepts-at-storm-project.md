<p>Aston Bay Holdings Ltd. and project operator American West Metals have reported new high-grade copper intercepts from ongoing exploration at the Storm Copper Project on Somerset Island, Nunavut. The companies operate the project under a 20/80 joint venture, with Aston Bay holding a free carried interest until a decision to mine is made. CEO Thomas Ullrich stated that drilling within and beyond the current resource envelope returned thick, high-grade intervals up to 27.3% copper, supporting significant expansion potential for the project.</p><p>The joint venture structure provides Aston Bay with a free carried interest until American West makes a decision to mine upon completion of a bankable feasibility study. This arrangement means American West will be solely responsible for funding the joint venture until such a decision is made. After a mining decision, Aston Bay will be diluted if it does not elect to contribute its proportionate share, with its interest in the Storm Project property converting into a 2% net smelter returns royalty if diluted below 10%.</p><p>Additional assays and permitting activities are currently underway as the project advances toward a resource update and pre-feasibility study scheduled for early 2026. The Storm Copper Project represents a significant opportunity in the critical minerals sector, with the high-grade intercepts demonstrating the property's potential for substantial copper resources.

The 27.3% copper intercepts represent exceptionally high-grade mineralization that could significantly impact the project's economic viability and resource estimates. The ongoing exploration success supports the companies' strategy of advancing the Storm Copper Project through systematic drilling and evaluation programs.</p><p>InvestorWire, the specialized communications platform that distributed this news, provides advanced wire-grade press release syndication as part of the Dynamic Brand Portfolio at IBN.
