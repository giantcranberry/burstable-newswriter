<p>Brais Law Firm has recovered more than $65 million in settlements and trial verdicts for clients since 2012, marking a significant milestone in maritime litigation. This substantial recovery amount underscores the firm's national leadership in maritime, cruise ship, and specialized personal injury litigation. The firm's collective team brings more than 70 years of combined litigation experience to complex admiralty and maritime cases.</p><p>The firm's success stems from its specialized focus on maritime law, including cases arising under the Jones Act, offshore oil rig accidents, and catastrophic cruise ship and boating injuries. This deep specialization distinguishes Brais Law Firm from general personal injury practices. Keith Brais, the firm's leader, possesses unique qualifications as a former marine engineer and U.S. Coast Guard license holder, providing technical understanding of vessel operations and safety that few other attorneys can match.</p><p>Maritime law requires specific expertise not only in the courtroom but in the operational realities of ships and offshore platforms, according to Mr. Brais. The firm's 70-plus years of combined experience means they're not just learning the law but shaping outcomes that set precedents and improve safety standards across the industry. This real-world perspective enables the firm to effectively dismantle corporate defenses and maximize recoveries for injured seamen, cruise ship passengers, and resort guests.</p><p>The multi-million dollar recoveries demonstrate the firm's commitment to securing comprehensive compensation for clients, covering damages including lost wages, medical expenses, and pain and suffering. Brais Law Firm maintains nationwide representation capabilities, ensuring victims of serious maritime and water-related accidents have access to highly qualified counsel regardless of location through their website at <a href="https://www.braislawfirm.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.braislawfirm.com</a>.</p><p>As a Board Certified Expert in Admiralty and Maritime Law, Keith Brais leads a firm that prioritizes client advocacy over corporate interests. The $65 million recovery milestone solidifies Brais Law Firm's position as a dominant force in maritime litigation, with implications for industry safety standards and victim compensation nationwide. The firm's track record suggests that specialized maritime legal expertise significantly impacts case outcomes and client recoveries in this complex legal domain, potentially driving higher safety standards across the maritime industry as corporations face increased accountability for accidents and injuries.</p>
