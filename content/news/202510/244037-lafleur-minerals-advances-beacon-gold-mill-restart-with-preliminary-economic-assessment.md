<p>LaFleur Minerals Inc. has engaged Environmental Resources Management to complete a Preliminary Economic Assessment supporting the planned restart of its 100%-owned Beacon Gold Mill. The study will utilize mineralized material primarily from the company's Swanson Gold Deposit in Val d'Or, Quebec, following encouraging drilling results that indicate continuity and expansion potential within the mineralized system.</p><p>ERM's Technical Mining Services Group in Toronto will oversee the comprehensive study, which will update the mineral resource estimate, mine plan, and metallurgical testing programs while providing detailed cost estimates for the Beacon Mill restart. This assessment represents a significant step forward in LaFleur's strategy to develop district-scale gold projects in the Abitibi Gold Belt near Val-d'Or, Qu√©bec.</p><p>The Swanson Gold Project spans approximately 18,304 hectares and includes several prospects rich in gold and critical metals previously held by Monarch Mining, Abcourt Mines, and Globex Mining. LaFleur has recently consolidated a large land package along a major structural break that hosts the Swanson, Bartec, and Jolin gold deposits and several other showings. The project's accessibility by road provides direct access to several nearby gold mills, enhancing its development potential.</p><p>The fully-permitted and refurbished Beacon Gold Mill is capable of processing over 750 tonnes per day and is being considered for processing mineralized material from Swanson as well as for custom milling operations for other nearby gold projects. The latest news and updates relating to the company are available in their <a href="https://ibn.fm/LFLRF" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">newsroom</a>.</p><p>This development comes as LaFleur Minerals focuses on advancing mining projects with particular emphasis on their resource-stage Swanson Gold Project and the Beacon Gold Mill, both of which show significant potential to deliver long-term value. The PEA represents a critical milestone in evaluating the economic viability of restarting the mill operations and leveraging the company's consolidated land position in this historically productive mining region.</p><p>For mining industry leaders and investors, this announcement signals potential near-term production capacity in a proven gold district. The Beacon Mill's existing infrastructure and permits could significantly reduce development timelines and capital requirements compared to greenfield projects. The consolidation of multiple former mining properties creates economies of scale and operational synergies that could enhance project economics.</p><p>The focus on the Abitibi Gold Belt positions LaFleur in one of the world's most prolific gold-producing regions, offering geological confidence and established mining infrastructure. The potential for custom milling operations represents an additional revenue stream that could improve the project's financial resilience. This strategic move demonstrates how junior mining companies can create value by revitalizing existing assets in established mining districts rather than pursuing riskier exploration in untested territories.</p>
