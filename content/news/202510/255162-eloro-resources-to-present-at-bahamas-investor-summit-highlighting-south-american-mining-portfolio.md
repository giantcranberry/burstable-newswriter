<p>Eloro Resources Ltd. announced that CEO Thomas Larsen will present and participate in investor meetings and a panel discussion at the Centurion One Capital 3rd Annual Bahamas Summit, taking place October 28-29, 2025, at the Rosewood Baha Mar Hotel in Nassau. Larsen stated he looks forward to updating investors on Eloro's ongoing progress during the event. The company maintains a portfolio of gold and base-metal properties across Bolivia, Peru and Quebec.</p><p>Eloro holds an option to acquire a 100% interest in the highly prospective Iska Iska Property, classified as a polymetallic epithermal-porphyry complex, located in the Potosi Department of southern Bolivia. A recent NI 43-101 technical report on Iska Iska completed by Micon International Limited is available on <a href="https://www.elororesources.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Eloro's website</a> and through SEDAR filings. Iska Iska represents a significant mineral deposit type and is notable for being road-accessible and royalty-free.</p><p>The company also owns an 82% interest in the La Victoria Gold/Silver Project in Peru's north-central mineral belt, positioned approximately 50 kilometers south of both the Lagunas Norte Gold Mine and La Arena Gold Mine. Investors seeking additional information about the company's developments can access the latest news and updates relating to ELRRF in the company's newsroom at <a href="https://ibn.fm/ELRRF" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://ibn.fm/ELRRF</a>.</p><p>The Centurion One Capital summit provides Eloro Resources with a platform to engage with potential investors and showcase its exploration and development progress. The company's participation in such events highlights its commitment to maintaining transparent communication with the investment community while advancing its mining projects across multiple jurisdictions. The timing of this presentation comes as the company continues to develop its portfolio of mineral properties in mining-friendly regions.</p><p>For mining investors and industry leaders, Eloro's presentation at this high-profile summit represents an opportunity to assess the company's strategic positioning in key South American mining jurisdictions. The company's diversified portfolio across Bolivia, Peru and Quebec provides geographic risk mitigation while offering exposure to multiple mineral systems. The Iska Iska property's classification as a polymetallic epithermal-porphyry complex suggests significant potential for multiple mineral discoveries, which could drive substantial value creation if exploration success continues.</p><p>The road-accessible and royalty-free nature of Iska Iska provides operational advantages that could accelerate development timelines and improve project economics. Similarly, the La Victoria Project's proximity to established gold mines in Peru offers validation of the region's mineral potential and potential infrastructure benefits. As global demand for critical minerals continues to grow, companies like Eloro Resources with strategic positions in mining-friendly jurisdictions are well-positioned to capitalize on emerging opportunities in the resource sector.</p>
