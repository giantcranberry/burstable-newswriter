<p>The Dairy Alliance has launched a new phase of its Milk's Got Game campaign featuring University of South Carolina SEC athletes TJ Moore and Nyck Harbor alongside their mothers, Alexandra Moore and Saundra Harbor. The initiative highlights how real dairy milk contributes to athletic performance through proper nutrition and family support systems.</p><p>Behind every great athlete stands a mom who makes sure they have what they need to succeed, said Joanne Engelhardt-Risko, Vice President of Strategic Marketing at The Dairy Alliance. This campaign continues to celebrate the moms who fuel their athletes with love, guidance, and real dairy milk â€” the natural sports drink that helps athletes recover, stay strong, and perform at their best on and off the field.</p><p>The campaign emphasizes the nutritional benefits of dairy milk for athletes, with each serving delivering 8 grams of high-quality protein to support strength, recovery, and energy. My mom made sure milk was always part of my daily routine, said wide receiver TJ Moore. It kept me fueled for practice and gave me energy to push harder on the field. Even today, it helps me stay strong and recover faster.</p><p>Alexandra Moore added that supporting TJ means giving him what he needs to perform at his best every day, noting that real dairy has been part of that foundation from the beginning. Similarly, Saundra Harbor explained that from breakfast to after-practice recovery, real dairy milk has been a consistent part of Nyck's routine, describing it as simple, reliable, and effective.</p><p>Wide receiver Nyck Harbor confirmed that dairy milk gave me the edge growing up and continues to support me as I train and play. Emily Waggoner, a South Carolina dairy farmer, expressed pride in joining The Dairy Alliance to highlight how Milk's Got Game, stating that from our farms to their families, real dairy milk delivers the nutrition and strength to fuel athletes on the field and at home.</p><p>The Milk's Got Game campaign underscores the connection between family support, proper nutrition, and athletic achievement, demonstrating that success begins at home and extends to collegiate sports performance.
