<p>True Nutrition Technology (TNT), one of Germany's leading sports nutrition brands, announced that its premium line of evidence-based supplements will soon be available to U.S. consumers on <a href="https://www.amazon.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Amazon</a>. The expansion represents a significant milestone for the German company as it moves beyond European markets to reach American athletes and health-conscious individuals.</p><p>Founded by former professional athletes Michael Weigl and Markus Himmelstoss, TNT has built its reputation on formulating products that meet the highest standards of safety, efficacy, and transparency. At True Nutrition Technology, we only bring products to market that we can fully stand behind, said Michael Weigl, CEO and co-founder. Every ingredient, every label, and every test reflects our belief that supplements should deliver exactly what they promise—and nothing less.</p><p>All TNT products are manufactured and packaged in Germany under HACCP, IFS, and TÜVNORD quality standards and undergo independent laboratory testing for purity, nutritional accuracy, and microbiological safety. The company makes certificates verifying these analyses publicly available, reinforcing its commitment to complete transparency in an industry where quality standards can vary widely.</p><p>The company's product lineup includes several performance-driven innovations that will now be accessible to U.S. consumers. These include Creatine Monohydrate Creapure®, widely regarded as the world's purest creatine; Micronutrients, a multivitamin powder combining 24 essential vitamins and minerals with natural boosters like green tea extract, spirulina, and CoQ10; and Vegan Basics, a comprehensive vegan supplement that includes creatine for energy support.</p><p>Bringing TNT to Amazon is an exciting milestone in our journey to introduce our German-crafted supplements to a broader audience, added co-founder Markus Himmelstoss. We want every customer—from serious athletes to everyday individuals—to experience the difference that proven quality and honest formulation can make.</p><p>The expansion comes at a time when American consumers are increasingly seeking transparent, scientifically-backed supplement options. TNT's entry into the U.S. market through Amazon's extensive distribution network will provide American consumers with access to German-engineered nutritional products that have been trusted by more than 400,000 customers across Europe since the company's founding in 2012.</p><p>This market entry represents a significant development for the U.S. sports nutrition industry, which has faced scrutiny over quality control and transparency issues. TNT's rigorous manufacturing standards and independent testing protocols set a new benchmark for quality assurance that could influence industry practices. For business leaders and consumers alike, the availability of German-engineered supplements through Amazon's platform signals a shift toward higher quality standards and greater transparency in the nutritional supplement market.</p><p>The timing of this expansion aligns with growing consumer demand for evidence-based health products and increased scrutiny of supplement quality. TNT's proven track record in European markets, combined with Amazon's distribution capabilities, creates a powerful combination that could disrupt the U.S. sports nutrition landscape. This move may prompt domestic manufacturers to enhance their quality control measures and transparency practices to remain competitive.</p>
