<p>Swiss Quantum Technology SA has entered into a significant agreement with D-Wave Quantum Inc. to deploy a D-Wave Advantage2 annealing quantum computer in Europe, representing a €10 million multi-year quantum computing as a service commitment. The placement of this SQT-funded system will support Italy's newly formed Q-Alliance, an initiative focused on establishing the country's quantum leadership position in the global technology landscape.</p><p>The Advantage2 system features D-Wave's most advanced quantum processor with over 4,400 qubits, designed as a powerful and energy-efficient quantum computer capable of solving complex computational problems beyond the reach of classical computers. This technology will be accessible to customers through D-Wave's Leap real-time quantum cloud service, facilitating quantum and hybrid quantum applications for production deployment across various industries.</p><p>Dr. Alan Baratz, CEO of D-Wave, emphasized the importance of this agreement, stating that it represents a milestone in the company's ongoing effort to expand global access to their fleet of annealing quantum computers. As Europe extends its quantum leadership, we believe that D-Wave's production-grade annealing quantum computing technology will serve as a critical component, fueling quantum application development and adoption now, Baratz explained. The agreement includes an option for SQT to purchase the system outright, providing flexibility in their long-term quantum computing strategy.</p><p>This deployment marks a significant step in Europe's quantum computing infrastructure development, particularly through Italy's Q-Alliance initiative. The system's capability to handle computationally complex problems faster and more efficiently than traditional computing methods positions it as a valuable resource for organizations across multiple sectors. With over 200 million problems already submitted to D-Wave's quantum systems to date, the company has established itself as a trusted provider for addressing use cases spanning optimization, artificial intelligence, and research applications. More information about D-Wave's quantum computing capabilities can be found at <a href="https://www.dwavequantum.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.dwavequantum.com</a>.</p><p>The €10 million investment represents a substantial commitment to advancing Europe's quantum computing capabilities at a time when global competition in quantum technology is intensifying. For business leaders and technology executives, this development signals growing accessibility to production-ready quantum computing resources that can drive innovation in optimization, machine learning, and complex problem-solving applications. The deployment through Italy's Q-Alliance initiative positions European organizations to leverage quantum advantage in sectors including finance, logistics, pharmaceuticals, and materials science, potentially accelerating research and development timelines while creating new competitive advantages in global markets.</p>
