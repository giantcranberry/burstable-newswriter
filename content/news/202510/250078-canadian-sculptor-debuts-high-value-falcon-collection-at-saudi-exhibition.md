<p>Canadian sculptor Tom Hjortholfson is presenting an exclusive collection of falcon sculptures at the Saudi International Falconry and Hunting Exhibition 2025, marking his debut in Saudi Arabia. His participation represents a significant cultural exchange between Canadian artistry and Middle Eastern falconry traditions, with pieces valued up to SR300,000 attracting international attention from collectors and art enthusiasts.</p><p>Hjortholfson's artistic journey into falcon sculpture began through an invitation from fellow Canadian artist John Logon to create a piece named "Nona." This experience proved transformative, ultimately leading to his collaboration with the <a href="https://saudifalcons.sa" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Saudi Falcons Club</a> and his current exhibition participation. The sculptor explained that his work draws inspiration from wildlife beauty, a lifelong passion that finds expression through detailed and expressive craftsmanship.</p><p>The centerpiece of Hjortholfson's exhibition is a rare falcon sculpture carved from Canadian jade valued at SR300,000. Weighing more than 45 kilograms, the piece features intricate bronze detailing and agate-inlaid eyes that capture the falcon's intense gaze. Another notable work, crafted from solid bronze with an ivory-white finish, carries a value of SR150,000. Each artwork in the collection is limited to just 12 editions worldwide, ensuring exclusivity and collectibility for serious art investors.</p><p>"The response has been wonderful," Hjortholfson noted. "Visitors have shown great appreciation, even though these are high-value art pieces created from rare and luxurious materials. We believe that true collectors will recognize their artistic and emotional value." The exhibition's artisan pavilions complement Hjortholfson's work by showcasing handcrafted pieces inspired by Saudi Arabia's landscapes, wildlife, and falconry heritage.</p><p>Organized by the Saudi Falcons Club, the <a href="https://saudifalcons.sa" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Saudi International Falconry and Hunting Exhibition 2025</a> continues through October 11 at the Riyadh Exhibition and Convention Center in Malham. The event brings together more than 1,300 exhibitors and brands from 45 countries, demonstrating Saudi Arabia's commitment to preserving cultural heritage while promoting international artistic exchange and innovation.</p><p>This exhibition represents a growing trend of cross-cultural artistic collaborations in the luxury goods market, where traditional craftsmanship meets contemporary artistic expression. For business leaders and collectors, such high-value limited edition artworks present unique investment opportunities while supporting cultural preservation efforts. The international attention generated by exhibitions of this scale also signals Saudi Arabia's expanding role as a global hub for cultural exchange and luxury art markets.</p>
