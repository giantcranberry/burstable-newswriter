<p>Quantum BioPharma Ltd. has launched a public whistleblower policy offering cash rewards of up to $7 million for verifiable evidence of stock manipulation involving the company's shares. The biopharmaceutical company, which focuses on treatments for neurodegenerative, metabolic, and alcohol misuse disorders, will pay the reward from the net proceeds of its ongoing lawsuit if the submitted information materially contributes to a final judgment or binding settlement in the company's favor.</p><p>The program allows eligible participants to submit information directly to reward@quantumbiopharma.com or by calling 1-833-571-1811. The initiative was approved by the company's board and audit committee with input from multiple law firms, underscoring Quantum BioPharma's commitment to transparency, accountability, and market integrity. The program also encourages simultaneous reporting to the U.S. SEC and Canadian regulatory authorities.</p><p>Quantum BioPharma maintains a diverse portfolio of innovative assets and biotech solutions through its various subsidiaries. Through its wholly owned subsidiary, Lucid Psycheceuticals Inc., the company is focused on the research and development of its lead compound, Lucid-MS, a patented new chemical entity shown to prevent and reverse myelin degradation in preclinical models. Myelin degradation represents the underlying mechanism of multiple sclerosis.</p><p>The company also invented unbuzzd(TM) and spun out its OTC version to Unbuzzd Wellness Inc., with Quantum BioPharma retaining ownership of 20.11% of the company as of March 31, 2025. The agreement includes royalty payments of 7% of sales from unbuzzd(TM) until payments to Quantum BioPharma total $250 million, after which the royalty drops to 3% in perpetuity. Quantum BioPharma retains 100% of the rights to develop similar products or alternative formulations specifically for pharmaceutical and medical uses.</p><p>Additional corporate information and updates relating to Quantum BioPharma are available in the company's newsroom at <a href="https://ibn.fm/QNTM" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://ibn.fm/QNTM</a>. The whistleblower program represents a significant step in the company's efforts to maintain market integrity while pursuing legal remedies against potential stock manipulation activities affecting its publicly traded shares on both NASDAQ and the Canadian Securities Exchange.</p>
