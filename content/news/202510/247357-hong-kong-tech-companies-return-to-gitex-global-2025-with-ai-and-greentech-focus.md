The Hong Kong Tech Pavilions at GITEX Global in Dubai will connect promising Hong Kong innovation and technology enterprises with partners in the Middle East and beyond.

The HKSAR Environmental Protection Department will demonstrate AI applications for environmental assessment and planning, including development of the AI Environmental Air Nuisance Investigation Robot Dog and creation of AI systems for monitoring noise and wastewater. TradeMonday offers a vertical GenAI SaaS platform that automates retail analytics and workflows, transforming data into profit-driving decisions with pre-trained AI agents. The company is backed by venture capital funds from Hong Kong, Turkiye and the US.</p><p>Chain Technology Development Co. Limited will present its award-winning Digital Twin solution that brings together AI, IoT data and spatial intelligence to address needs in architecture, engineering, construction and operation industries.
