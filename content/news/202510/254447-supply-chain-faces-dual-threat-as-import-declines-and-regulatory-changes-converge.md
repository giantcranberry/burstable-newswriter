<p>The October ITS Logistics US Port/Rail Ramp Freight Index reveals a concerning convergence of declining import volumes and regulatory changes that threaten to remove significant trucking capacity from the supply chain ecosystem. While port and rail ramp operations currently face no major operational challenges, the combination of reduced container volumes and stricter enforcement of commercial driver licensing requirements represents what industry experts describe as storm clouds on the horizon for shippers and carriers alike.</p><p>Import volumes continue their downward trajectory, with September projections at 2.12 million TEUs representing a 6.8% year-over-year decrease from August's 2.28 million TEUs. The National Retail Federation anticipates further declines through year-end, attributing the trend to tariffs and frontloading activity earlier in 2025. In response to this container demand reduction, ocean carriers are strictly enforcing accessorial fee schedules to maintain profitability, placing additional pressure on shippers already navigating a soft freight market.</p><p>The more significant threat emerges from regulatory changes affecting trucking capacity. Following a nationwide audit of CDL licenses, the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration issued an emergency interim ruling on September 26 restricting eligibility for non-domiciled CDLs. Several states have since implemented enforcement efforts to verify CDL compliance and English language proficiency at weigh stations, ports of entry, and major transportation routes. Industry analysis indicates that non-domiciled CDL holders account for a substantial portion of the lower-cost capacity market, and regulatory crackdowns are expected to trigger increased bankruptcies among small and mid-size carriers.</p><p>Paul Brashier, Vice President of Global Supply Chain for ITS Logistics, warned that these developments compound existing challenges in the drayage market, where multiple major providers have closed their doors throughout 2025. The stricter enforcement of non-domiciled CDLs and ELP requirements will likely exacerbate financial challenges, ultimately impacting terminal and port operations as capacity diminishes. In the near term, these regulations will remove capacity and cause market disruption, while long-term consequences could drive additional carriers out of business as they struggle with both regulatory pressures and the ongoing freight recession that has pushed rates to or below operating levels.</p><p>Shippers face increased operational risks during this transitional period. ITS Logistics recommends companies review their supply chains for inefficiencies that could be exposed under the renewed focus on accessorial fee enforcement. Brashier advises shippers to confirm that accessorial dispute processes and documentation requirements are clearly defined in standard operating procedures. For supply chains utilizing rail for ocean container movement, understanding chassis pool flip policies and resolution protocols within free time becomes increasingly critical as market conditions tighten.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.its4logistics.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">ITS Logistics</a> US Port/Rail Ramp Freight Index forecasts port container and dray operations across Pacific, Atlantic, and Gulf regions, while also highlighting ocean and domestic container rail ramp operations in both West Inland and East Inland regions. As shippers prepare for late 2025 and early 2026 RFP activity, vetting service provider financial health becomes paramount in navigating the evolving regulatory landscape and its impact on transportation capacity.</p>
