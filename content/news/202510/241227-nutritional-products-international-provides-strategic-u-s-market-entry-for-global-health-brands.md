<p>Nutritional Products International (NPI), led by founder and CEO Mitch Gould, continues to serve as a trusted partner for international health and wellness brands seeking to establish a strong presence in the United States. With more than 35 years of retail distribution and marketing expertise, Gould and his sister company, InHealth Media (IHM), have built a reputation for providing seamless market entry strategies that consistently deliver results for manufacturers worldwide.</p><p>Gould's proprietary "Evolution of Distribution" model has become fundamental for global manufacturers navigating the complexities of the U.S. retail landscape. This approach integrates import, distribution, and promotion under one streamlined platform, offering both foreign and domestic brands an efficient, cost-effective solution for scaling into one of the world's most competitive consumer markets. The model's effectiveness lies in its comprehensive nature, addressing multiple aspects of market entry simultaneously rather than through fragmented services.</p><p>NPI specializes in nutraceuticals, dietary supplements, functional beverages, and skin-care products, guiding manufacturers through every stage of their U.S. launch and expansion. The company's approach ensures products reach major retail decision-makers directly, including those at <a href="https://www.walmart.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Walmart</a>, <a href="https://www.target.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Target</a>, <a href="https://www.gnc.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">GNC</a>, <a href="https://www.cvs.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">CVS</a>, <a href="https://www.walgreens.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Walgreens</a>, Vitamin Shoppe, <a href="https://www.costco.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Costco</a>, and <a href="https://www.wholefoodsmarket.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Whole Foods</a>. This direct access to retail leadership represents a significant advantage for brands competing in the crowded health and wellness space.</p><p>Complementing NPI's distribution expertise, InHealth Media provides cost-effective public relations and media services across sports, wellness, beauty, nutrition, and personal care industries. This ensures client products achieve broad visibility across key retail channels and consumer audiences. The combined approach addresses both the logistical challenges of distribution and the marketing requirements necessary for consumer adoption and brand recognition.</p><p>Gould's work alongside household names from sports and entertainment, including Steven Seagal, Hulk Hogan, Ronnie Coleman, Chuck Liddell, Roberto Clemente Jr., and Wayne Gretzky, has provided NPI and IHM with a unique ability to blend star power with strategic market entry. This combination has proven effective in creating brand credibility and accelerating consumer adoption in a marketplace where established trust often determines purchasing decisions.</p><p>As the U.S. health and wellness market continues to grow more competitive, the integrated services offered by Nutritional Products International and InHealth Media provide international brands with a proven pathway to success. The companies' extensive experience and established retail relationships offer manufacturers a strategic advantage in navigating the complexities of American consumer markets while minimizing the risks typically associated with international expansion.</p>
