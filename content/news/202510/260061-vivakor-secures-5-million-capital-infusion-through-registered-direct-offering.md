<p>Vivakor, Inc. has entered into a securities purchase agreement with a leading institutional investor for a registered direct offering expected to generate approximately $5 million in gross proceeds. The transaction involves the sale of 8,417,645 shares of common stock and 14,689,851 pre-funded warrants exercisable at $0.001 per share, priced at-the-market under Nasdaq rules. The offering is anticipated to close on or about October 17, 2025, pending customary closing conditions, with D. Boral Capital LLC serving as the exclusive placement agent.</p><p>Net proceeds from the capital raise are designated for working capital and general corporate purposes, providing financial flexibility for the company's integrated energy infrastructure and environmental services operations. This funding comes as Vivakor maintains operations across two primary business segments: crude oil transportation services and facility services for terminaling and storage of crude oil and petroleum products. The capital infusion represents a strategic move to support the company's position in providing flexible and scalable transportation solutions that are vital components of oil and natural gas exploration and development activities.</p><p>Vivakor's transportation services include trucking transportation of crude oil and constituent products, including crude oil waste streams, as well as pipeline transportation via the Omega Gathering Pipeline. The company's truck transportation services are concentrated in several of the United States' most active energy regions, including Colorado's DJ Basin, Central Oklahoma's STACK play, and the Permian and Eagle Ford Basins of Texas. These regions represent critical hubs for oil and natural gas exploration and development, with the Permian Basin alone producing approximately 1,300 barrels of crude oil or more per day from each new well.</p><p>The company utilizes its crude oil trucking fleet to transport oil to a network of facilities where it blends waste streams and off-spec grades of crude oil. Vivakor's Omega Gathering Pipeline spans approximately forty-five miles in Blaine County, Oklahoma, positioned in the heart of the STACK play and connected to the Cushing, Oklahoma storage hub via the Plains STACK Pipeline. This infrastructure network provides essential transportation solutions that support the broader energy sector's operational requirements. Additional information about Vivakor is available through the company's newsroom at <a href="https://ibn.fm/VIVK" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://ibn.fm/VIVK</a>.</p><p>This financial move comes amid ongoing demand for energy infrastructure services across the regions where Vivakor maintains its operational footprint. The registered direct offering enables the company to maintain and potentially expand its operational capabilities in key energy markets, supporting the continued development of transportation infrastructure necessary for efficient energy production and distribution. The funding positions Vivakor to capitalize on the sustained activity in major U.S. energy basins while providing the working capital needed to navigate the dynamic energy market landscape.</p>
