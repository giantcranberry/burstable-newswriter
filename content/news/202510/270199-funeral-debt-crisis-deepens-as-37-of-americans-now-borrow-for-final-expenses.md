<p>The financial burden of funeral expenses has escalated into a significant crisis, with new data showing 37% of Americans now incur debt to cover final expenses for loved ones. This represents a dramatic increase from just 14% in 2024, according to the annual Death and Debt survey conducted by <a href="https://www.debt.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Debt.com</a>. The survey of 1,000 Americans reveals that credit cards have become the primary funding method for funeral costs, used by 59% of those who borrowed money for end-of-life expenses.</p><p>Howard Dvorkin, CPA and Chairman of Debt.com, characterized the situation as a troubling trend. "Funeral costs have become a new financial crisis. Families want to honor their loved ones, but too often, compassion outweighs affordability â€” and credit becomes the only way to say a final goodbye." Beyond credit cards, the survey found that 38% of Americans relied on personal loans and 22% turned to funeral-specific financing to cover these expenses.</p><p>The financial vulnerability extends well beyond the immediate costs, with 57% of Americans reporting they could not afford a loved one's funeral today without incurring debt. The repercussions are both significant and long-lasting, as 36% of Americans said they would delay paying other essential bills such as rent, credit cards, or utilities to cover funeral costs. Following services, 25% reported feeling anxious due to funeral-related debt, 19% struggle to keep up with payments, and 17% had already postponed other bills to manage this debt.</p><p>The amount of debt Americans are taking on has increased substantially across all categories. Those borrowing less than $1,000 doubled from 6% in 2024 to 13% in 2025, while those taking on $1,000-$5,000 nearly tripled from 6% to 17%. The most concerning increase came in the highest debt category, with those borrowing more than $5,000 rising from 2% to 7% year-over-year.</p><p>Generation X appears to be bearing the heaviest burden, being most likely to have taken on debt after a loved one's death while also balancing children and aging parents. The survey revealed generational differences in borrowing methods, with Gen X most often using credit cards, Millennials leaning on personal loans, and Baby Boomers outpacing other generations in using funeral loans.</p><p>The data also reveals concerning gaps in financial planning, with half of all Americans not discussing how their debt or funeral expenses will be handled. While knowledge about what happens to someone's debt after they die has improved from 2023 levels, it decreased from 61% in 2024 to 55% in 2025, indicating a need for greater financial education around end-of-life planning.</p>
