<p>Lahontan Gold Corp. has submitted a Notice of Operations to the U.S. Bureau of Land Management for planned exploration drilling at its West Santa Fe Project, located 13 kilometers southwest of the company's flagship Santa Fe Mine Project. This regulatory submission represents a critical milestone in the company's Nevada exploration program, positioning West Santa Fe as a strategic satellite operation with significant exploration potential.</p><p>The submitted Notice covers multiple drill sites, access roads, and drilling sumps as Lahontan prepares to implement an aggressive drilling strategy. The program includes twinning historic holes, drilling down-dip extensions, and testing mineralization along strike. This comprehensive approach builds upon historical work that included 171 drill holes totaling over 13,000 meters, which previously outlined shallow, oxidized gold and silver mineralization near the historic Mindora underground mine.</p><p>Kimberly Ann, Lahontan Founder, Chair, CEO, and President, emphasized that once approved, the company will conduct its first drilling program at West Santa Fe. The primary objectives include validating the extensive historic drill hole database and expanding the footprint of disseminated gold and silver mineralization. This validation process is critical for converting historical data into compliant mineral resources that can support future economic assessments.</p><p>The West Santa Fe Project represents an important component of Lahontan's broader Nevada portfolio, which includes four top-tier gold and silver exploration properties in the mining-friendly Walker Lane region. The company's flagship Santa Fe Mine project has demonstrated substantial historical production, with 359,202 ounces of gold and 702,067 ounces of silver produced between 1988 and 1995 from open pit mines using heap-leach processing.</p><p>According to the company's technical disclosures, the Santa Fe Mine currently hosts a Canadian National Instrument 43-101 compliant Indicated Mineral Resource of 1,539,000 ounces gold equivalent and an Inferred Mineral Resource of 411,000 ounces gold equivalent. These resources are pit-constrained and based on comprehensive technical analysis detailed in the company's technical documentation available at https://lahontangoldcorp.com.</p><p>The timing of this regulatory submission aligns with Lahontan's broader corporate strategy for 2025, which includes advancing the Santa Fe Mine project toward production, updating the Santa Fe Preliminary Economic Assessment, and conducting drill testing at the West Santa Fe satellite project. The technical content of the company's disclosures has been reviewed and approved by Michael Lindholm, CPG, an Independent Consulting Geologist who serves as a Qualified Person as defined in National Instrument 43-101.</p><p>For investors seeking additional information, the latest news and updates are available through the company's newsroom at http://ibn.fm/LGCXF. The successful advancement of the West Santa Fe exploration program could significantly enhance Lahontan's overall resource base and strengthen its position in Nevada's prolific mining district, potentially creating substantial value for stakeholders in the competitive precious metals sector.</p>
