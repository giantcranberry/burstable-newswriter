<p>MDH Partners has closed $111.5 million in financing from Truist Bank, supporting nearly 800,000 square feet of the firm's recent industrial property acquisitions across Georgia, Nevada, and California. The Canyon Loan represents a significant capital infusion that enhances MDH's buying power as the firm continues pursuing high-quality assets in top-tier industrial markets.</p><p>Matthew Ludwig, Director of Debt Capital Markets at MDH who joined the firm in June 2025, secured the financing through Truist's Mark Hancock. Acknowledging the volatility within the capital markets, our disciplined underwriting, coupled with the high-performance of these assets, allowed us to secure competitive financing from our long-standing partner, Truist Bank, Ludwig stated. The financing strengthens Fund III's position as MDH pursues additional acquisitions in Texas and California markets.</p><p>The five-year, non-recourse Canyon Loan supports MDH's acquisitions of three key industrial properties: 3970 Johns Creek in Suwanee, Georgia, a 130,783-square-foot industrial property purchased in June 2025; Sunrise Buildings One and Two in Las Vegas, totaling 509,216 square feet at 4601 E Cheyenne Ave and 3101 N Marion Drive, acquired in February 2025; and Ontario Commerce Park in Ontario, California, a fully leased, four-building 133,400-square-foot industrial park at 720 â€“ 780 S. Miliken Ave, closed in September 2025.</p><p>Truist's Hancock emphasized the significance of the relationship, noting that The Canyon Portfolio marks Truist's fifth portfolio closing with MDH over the past five years and we greatly appreciate the full relationship we have formed with industry-leading MDH Partners. Hancock highlighted the geographic and tenant diversification within the Canyon Portfolio as key factors aligning with Truist's client and commercial real estate strategy.</p><p>MDH is currently investing its Fund III, a $1.2 billion discretionary fund, and has closed more than $1.3 billion in assets since the beginning of 2024. The firm maintains another $175 million of properties under control or recently closed that have yet to be financed, indicating continued expansion in the industrial real estate sector. MDH continues to actively pursue industrial investment opportunities across all risk profiles while currently owning or managing approximately 35 million square feet across 33 markets in 18 states.
