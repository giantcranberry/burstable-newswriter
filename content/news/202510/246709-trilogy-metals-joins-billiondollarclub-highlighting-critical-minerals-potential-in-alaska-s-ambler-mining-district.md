<p>Trilogy Metals Inc. has been added to the BillionDollarClub, an InvestorBrandNetwork platform that showcases innovative small- and mid-cap companies with billion-dollar potential. This recognition underscores Trilogy's strategic positioning in critical minerals development, particularly copper, zinc, lead, gold, and silver resources that are driving the global energy transition. The company's profile can be viewed at <a href="https://ibn.fm/vWsym" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://ibn.fm/vWsym</a>.</p><p>The company holds a 50 percent interest in Ambler Metals LLC, which maintains 100 percent ownership of the Upper Kobuk Mineral Projects in northwestern Alaska. This strategic position gives Trilogy significant exposure to one of the richest and most prospective copper-dominant districts globally. The region hosts world-class polymetallic volcanogenic massive sulphide deposits containing copper, zinc, lead, gold, and silver, positioning the company at the forefront of North American critical minerals development.</p><p>Trilogy formed a 50/50 joint venture with South32 on December 19, 2019, combining expertise and resources to advance development in the Ambler Mining District. This partnership brings together specialized knowledge and financial capacity to accelerate exploration and potential development activities. The collaboration represents a significant step forward in establishing the region as a premier North American copper producer capable of supplying essential materials for renewable energy infrastructure, electric vehicles, and advanced technologies.</p><p>The Ambler Mining District contains carbonate replacement deposits that have demonstrated high-grade copper and cobalt mineralization, adding another dimension to the region's resource potential. Exploration efforts have concentrated on two primary deposits: the Arctic VMS deposit and the Bornite carbonate replacement deposit. Both are situated within an extensive land package spanning approximately 190,929 hectares, providing substantial resource potential for future development and long-term value creation.</p><p>Ambler Metals has established a cooperative framework with NANA Regional Corporation, Inc., an Alaska Native Corporation, ensuring that exploration and potential development activities proceed in collaboration with local communities. This partnership reflects Trilogy's commitment to responsible resource development while respecting and protecting subsistence livelihoods in the region. The approach demonstrates how modern mining operations can integrate environmental and social considerations while delivering essential materials for the global energy transition.</p><p>The BillionDollarClub platform, part of IBN's Dynamic Brand Portfolio comprising over 70 specialized brands, provides comprehensive corporate communications services.
