<p>PetVivo Holdings, Inc. will present at the Spartan Capital Securities Second Annual Investor Conference on November 3, 2025, at the Marriott Marquis Hotel in New York City. The company's participation signals its emergence as an innovative player in the veterinary biomedical sector and provides an opportunity to connect with institutional investors seeking growth opportunities in animal healthcare.</p><p>John Lai, Chief Executive Officer of PetVivo Holdings, Inc., emphasized the significance of the conference platform for sharing the company's progress and strengthening relationships within the capital markets community. During his presentation, Lai will highlight the company's flagship products, SPRYNG with OsteoCushion Technology and PrecisePRP, both representing advancements in veterinary medical devices for joint health management.</p><p>SPRYNG with OsteoCushion Technology is an intra-articular injectable veterinary medical device consisting of sterilized, extra-cellular matrix microparticles. The technology works by having microparticles adsorb onto the joint synovial lining of animals and subsequently integrate with the animal's subsynovial tissue. This action promotes the restoration of proper joint mechanics, aiding in the management of noninfectious sources of joint pain such as joint instability, degenerative joint disease and osteoarthritis.</p><p>PrecisePRP represents a significant innovation as a first-in-class off-the-shelf platelet-rich plasma product designed for veterinary use. Unlike traditional PRP mechanical kits that require blood draws and centrifugation, PrecisePRP offers a leucoreduced, allogeneic, pooled, freeze-dried PRP that provides a species-specific source of concentrated platelets in plasma for intra-articular administration in dogs and horses. Each vial guarantees uniformity with a consistent dose of 4 billion platelets per vial at a concentration of 500,000 platelets per microliter and is leucoreduced with less than 1500 white blood cells per microliter.</p><p>John D. Lowry, Founder and Chief Executive Officer of Spartan Capital Securities, LLC, expressed enthusiasm about featuring PetVivo Holdings at the conference, noting Spartan Capital's reputation for helping growth companies access appropriate investors and resources. The conference, organized in partnership with B2i Digital, will showcase more than 60 carefully selected companies across various high-growth sectors, with over 500 institutional and high-net-worth investors expected to attend.</p><p>David Shapiro, CEO of B2i Digital, highlighted the broader commitment to connecting investors with diverse growth companies, combining digital marketing reach with face-to-face investor engagement. The event will feature main-stage presentations, expert panels, curated one-on-one meetings, and extensive networking sessions designed to foster meaningful dialogue between growth companies and the investment community.

The company's focus on leveraging human therapies for companion animal treatment represents a strategic approach to capital efficiency and accelerated market entry compared to more stringently regulated pharmaceuticals and biologics.</p>
