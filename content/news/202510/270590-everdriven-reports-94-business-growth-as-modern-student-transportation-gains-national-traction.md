<p>EverDriven, the nation's leader in Modern Student Transportation, announced a 94% year-over-year increase in new business growth for fiscal year 2025, signaling a nationwide shift toward alternative transportation solutions. This surge reflects growing commitment to modern, flexible systems that ensure every student can access education safely and reliably.</p><p>The charter school sector represents a notable area of impact for this transportation evolution. Across the country, charter school enrollment continues to climb, with 84% of states experiencing charter enrollment growth that exceeds school-aged population growth. EverDriven has witnessed this trend firsthand, with charter school partnerships increasing 31% from FY24 to FY25 and an astounding 173% over the past two years, highlighting how alternative transportation is becoming a critical enabler of access and equity.</p><p>Districts are facing a perfect storm of challenges, according to EverDriven CEO Mitch Bowling. From rising numbers of students experiencing housing instability or with special education requirements, to rapid charter school growth and new state regulations, schools are rethinking how they ensure every student's transportation needs are met.</p><p>Safety remains EverDriven's highest priority and key differentiator. According to the company's <a href="https://www.everdriven.com/future-of-modern-student-transportation-and-safety-report" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Future of Modern Student Transportation and Safety Report</a>, EverDriven safely transported more than 31,000 students over 33 million miles last year, achieving a 99.99 percent safety record. Since inception, the company has completed over 12 million trips spanning 180 million miles with 100 percent compliance with state and federal safety standards.</p><p>This safety focus guided EverDriven's early response to California's Senate Bill 88 (SB88). Rather than waiting for the July 2025 deadline, the company completed all necessary compliance work six months in advance, adhering to enhanced safety protocols, driver training requirements, and vehicle maintenance regulations. The systems developed for SB88 compliance have been integrated across EverDriven's national operations to ensure every district benefits from elevated safety standards.</p><p>Carlos Chicas, Executive Director of Maintenance, Operations, and Transportation at Capistrano Unified School District, noted that EverDriven took the guesswork out of SB88 compliance. Their expert team ensures drivers, vehicles, and reporting are fully aligned with the new regulations. Their proactive approach gave us confidence that we were fully compliant long before the deadline.</p><p>EverDriven now supports more than 800 school districts across 36 states, safely transporting 32,641 students to and from school. As demand continues to rise, the company is focused on scaling its impact, bringing modern, student-centered transportation to more communities nationwide and ensuring that every student, regardless of circumstance, has a safe and reliable way to access education.</p>
