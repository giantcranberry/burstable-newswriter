<p>Hybrid Power Solutions Inc. has secured an advance purchase order valued at $1,173,800 with LMDH Equipment Sales Inc., representing a significant commitment to clean energy adoption in industrial applications. The order includes twelve HPSS Spark units and one HPSS Terra unit, with deliveries scheduled to meet ongoing 2025 and 2026 customer forecasts. This agreement follows a successful long-term demonstration period between the companies.</p><p>CEO and Founder Francois Byrne stated that this landmark order highlights the growing demand for innovative, zero-emission and low emissions power solutions in the Canadian rental market. The advance purchase order prioritizes LMDH deliveries as the company commits to a significant order over the next year, reinforcing Hybrid Power Solutions' mission to drive sustainable energy adoption across industries.</p><p>Dustin Hubert, Chief Operating Officer of LMDH Equipment Sales Inc., explained that the partnership responds to customer demands for more resilient and sustainable power sources with increased fuel savings over traditional temporary power solutions. LMDH remains committed to supporting the construction and rental equipment industries through this collaboration.</p><p>The HPSS Spark system delivers up to 48,000W of peak power and 30kWh of energy storage, capable of handling demanding loads such as site trailers, welding equipment, or heavy-duty tools. The system offers both all-electric and hybrid modes, with the all-electric model providing net-zero emissions when paired with solar panels, while the hybrid model integrates with existing generators to reduce fuel costs by up to 75% during off-grid operations. The compact, towable design is engineered and assembled in Canada for reliability in extreme conditions, eliminating diesel exhaust, noise, and maintenance hassles while supporting sustainability goals.</p><p>The HPSS Terra system represents a scalable battery energy storage microgrid rated at 167kVA continuous output with expandable architecture for larger systems. It combines battery storage with seamless integration for solar, wind, or traditional generators, storing excess renewable energy for on-demand use even in low-light conditions. The mobile microgrid format supports on-grid, off-grid, and backup roles with advanced monitoring for remote control, engineered for harsh industrial environments with robust thermal management and safety protocols.</p><p>Recent deployments of these systems include trials with major Canadian transit agencies, where the technology has enabled extended work shifts by replacing noisy diesel units. A Canadian transit operator used Terra systems to gain an extra hour of daily productivity by switching from diesel generators. The systems are positioned for expansion into mining, rail, and marine sectors, demonstrating the broad applicability of clean power solutions across multiple industries.
