<p>CHARBONE Corporation has commenced civil construction work at its Sorel-Tracy site, signaling the concrete launch of Quebec's first clean ultra high purity hydrogen production module. The work began on October 27, 2025, aligning precisely with the timeline the company outlined in its October 22 press release available at <a href="https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases</a>. This construction phase involves comprehensive preparation of technical infrastructure and installation of foundations necessary for reassembling main equipment, which was successfully delivered earlier this month.</p><p>The project represents CHARBONE's initial step in establishing a distributed network of green hydrogen production plants across North America using its modular approach. Dave B. Gagnon, CEO of CHARBONE, expressed pride in the project's progression according to plan, attributing the success to the commitment of company teams and partners. The start of civil construction work brings the company's vision of local, decarbonized clean UHP hydrogen production in Quebec to tangible reality.</p><p>Each achieved milestone advances the project toward its anticipated November commissioning date. The company's modular production model aims to reduce risk while enhancing flexibility in hydrogen production, positioning CHARBONE as a key player in North America's transition to low-carbon energy solutions. As detailed in the company's corporate information at <a href="https://www.charbone.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.charbone.com</a>, CHARBONE specializes in clean UHP hydrogen and strategic industrial gas distribution across North America and Asia-Pacific regions.</p><p>This development comes as part of CHARBONE's broader strategy to diversify revenues through helium and specialty gas partnerships while building its hydrogen production infrastructure. The successful initiation of construction work demonstrates the company's ability to execute its announced timelines and brings Quebec closer to establishing local production capacity for clean hydrogen, an increasingly critical component in global decarbonization efforts. The modular approach could serve as a blueprint for rapid deployment of hydrogen infrastructure across multiple regions, potentially accelerating the adoption of clean energy alternatives in industrial and transportation sectors.</p><p>For business leaders and technology executives monitoring the energy transition, CHARBONE's progress signals the maturation of hydrogen as a viable clean energy solution. The company's ability to maintain construction timelines suggests that modular hydrogen production could overcome some of the scalability challenges that have historically hampered clean energy deployment. This development positions Quebec at the forefront of North America's hydrogen economy while demonstrating practical pathways for reducing industrial carbon emissions through localized clean energy production.</p>
