<p>Zonte Metals Inc. has reported significant exploration advancements at its Cross Hills Copper Project in Newfoundland and Labrador, including the discovery of copper and silver mineralization at the N Dunns target and the progression of multiple large-scale Iron Oxide Copper-Gold targets toward drill testing. After seven years of systematic exploration, the company has transformed the project from an early-stage property into a district-scale IOCG system featuring nine drill-ready targets.</p><p>Recent geophysical surveys, particularly high-resolution gravity data, have identified strong, deep-seated anomalies interpreted as potentially representing mineralized systems. These anomalies display substantial dimensions of up to 3,300 metres in length, 600 metres wide, and 1,000 metres in depth, with many remaining open along strike and at depth. The targets exhibit gravity anomalies ranging from 1 to 5 mGals, with volumes suggestive of significant tonnage potential.</p><p>The N Dunns target represents a major development, with copper-silver mineralization discovered at surface above a large geophysical anomaly. Fieldwork uncovered IOCG-style mineralization in narrow veins measuring 2-15 cm wide, traceable for up to 150 metres before disappearing under cover. A grab sample from one vein returned assay results of 0.5% copper, 14.3 g/t silver, trace gold with greater than 10% iron. The company cautions that grab samples are selective by nature and may not be representative of mineralization throughout the target area.</p><p>With approximately $5 million invested in systematic exploration including geophysics, geochemistry, and geological mapping, Cross Hills now positions as an advanced exploration-stage project with geological characteristics analogous to globally recognized IOCG systems such as Olympic Dam and Prominent Hill in Australia. The discovery of surface copper mineralization spatially above the N Dunns anomaly has prompted plans to advance this target to the drill stage, with additional exploration including infill and extensions to soil and gravity grids.</p><p>Terry Christopher, CEO of Zonte Metals, stated that years of exploration have delineated a large-scale, copper-fertile hydrothermal system at Cross Hills, with the N Dunns discovery providing key validation of the project's IOCG potential. More information on the Cross Hills Copper Project can be found at <a href="https://www.zontemetals.com/projects/cross-hills-copper-property" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.zontemetals.com/projects/cross-hills-copper-property</a>. The company's progress represents significant advancement in understanding the mineral potential of this underexplored district as it transitions into the drilling phase to test the identified targets.</p><p>For business and technology leaders, this development signals potential new sources of critical minerals essential for the global energy transition and technological advancement. The discovery of copper mineralization in an underexplored region could have significant implications for supply chain diversification and regional economic development. As the project moves toward drilling, it represents a critical test of the geological model that could either validate the district's potential or redirect exploration efforts.</p><p>The advancement of multiple targets simultaneously demonstrates the scale of the opportunity and the systematic approach taken by the exploration team. The transition from surface exploration to drilling represents a key inflection point in project development, where theoretical potential meets empirical testing. The results from upcoming drilling programs will be closely watched by industry participants and investors alike, as successful outcomes could establish a new copper district in a stable mining jurisdiction.</p>
