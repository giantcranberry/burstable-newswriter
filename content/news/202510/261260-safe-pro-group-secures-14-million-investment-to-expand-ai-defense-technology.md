<p>Safe Pro Group Inc. has completed a $14 million strategic investment led by Ondas Holdings Inc., marking a significant expansion of the company's artificial intelligence defense portfolio. The funding follows earlier investments by Ondas and Unusual Machines and will accelerate deployment of Safe Pro's SPOTD systems across defense and humanitarian applications worldwide.</p><p>The company's technology has demonstrated practical effectiveness through successful field evaluations in Ukraine, where the challenging security environment provided real-world testing grounds. Following these evaluations, Safe Pro launched its SPOTD NODE system, capable of generating high-resolution 2D and 3D mapping without requiring internet connectivity. This capability is particularly valuable in conflict zones and remote areas where reliable communications infrastructure may be unavailable or compromised.</p><p>On October 20, 2025, Safe Pro demonstrated its SpotlightAI OnSite and NODE technologies to multiple U.S. military departments, achieving key commercialization milestones. The company is advancing integration of its AI systems with suppliers in the U.S. Army's Short Range Reconnaissance Program, where the technology can help identify more than 150 explosive threat types in real time. This integration enhances situational awareness for soldiers and allies, potentially reducing casualties from improvised explosive devices and other battlefield threats.</p><p>Safe Pro Group operates as a mission-driven technology company delivering AI-enabled security and defense solutions through cutting-edge platforms like SPOTD. The company leverages commercially available off-the-shelf drones with proprietary machine learning and computer vision technology to enable rapid identification of explosives threats. This approach provides a safer and more efficient alternative to traditional human-based analysis methods, which often expose personnel to direct danger.</p><p>Built on a cloud-based ecosystem powered by Amazon Web Services, Safe Pro Group's scalable platform targets multiple markets including commercial, government, law enforcement and humanitarian sectors. The company's technology suite includes Safe Pro AI software, Safe-Pro USA protective gear and Airborne Response drone-based services, all designed to work in synergy to deliver safety and operational efficiency. Additional information about the company is available through its <a href="https://ibn.fm/SPAI" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">newsroom</a>.</p><p>The strategic investment comes at a time when defense technologies are increasingly incorporating artificial intelligence to enhance security capabilities while reducing risks to human operators. Safe Pro's approach of using commercially available drones with specialized AI processing represents a cost-effective solution that can be rapidly deployed across various operational environments. The company's progress in Ukraine and with U.S. military programs demonstrates the practical application of AI technologies in addressing complex security challenges facing defense and humanitarian organizations globally.</p>
