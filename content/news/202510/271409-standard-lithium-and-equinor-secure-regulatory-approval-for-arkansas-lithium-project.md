<p>The Arkansas Oil and Gas Commission has unanimously approved Standard Lithium Ltd.'s Integration Application for the Reynolds Brine Unit, marking a significant regulatory milestone for the company's joint venture with Equinor. The approval ensures access to the 20,854-acre brine production area while protecting mineral owners' rights and de-risking the project's resource base for the South West Arkansas Project.</p><p>This decision represents the latest in a series of regulatory successes for the Smackover Lithium joint venture, which previously received unanimous AOGC approval for unitization and established Arkansas' first lithium royalty at 2.5%. The project, developed through a 55:45 partnership between Standard Lithium and global energy leader Equinor, aims to produce 22,500 tonnes of battery-quality lithium carbonate annually beginning in 2028.</p><p>The regulatory clearance comes at a critical time for domestic lithium production as demand for electric vehicle batteries and energy storage systems continues to grow. The South West Arkansas Project's location in the Smackover Formation, recognized as a world-class lithium brine asset, positions it to become a significant contributor to the North American battery supply chain. Standard Lithium's approach focuses on sustainable development through scalable direct lithium extraction and purification processes applied to high-grade brine resources.</p><p>For additional information about Standard Lithium, investors can access the company's newsroom at <a href="https://ibn.fm/SLI" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://ibn.fm/SLI</a>. The full press release detailing the regulatory approval is available at <a href="https://ibn.fm/iYLV7" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://ibn.fm/iYLV7</a>. The joint venture's progress demonstrates how strategic partnerships between lithium developers and established energy companies can accelerate the development of critical mineral resources while navigating complex regulatory landscapes.</p><p>The successful integration approval represents more than just regulatory complianceâ€”it establishes a framework for responsible resource development that balances commercial objectives with stakeholder protections. As the project moves toward its 2028 production target, this regulatory foundation provides stability for future investment and development decisions in Arkansas' emerging lithium sector.</p>
