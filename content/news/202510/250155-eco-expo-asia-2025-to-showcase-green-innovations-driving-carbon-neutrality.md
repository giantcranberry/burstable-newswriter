<p>The 20th edition of Eco Expo Asia, themed Green Innovations for Carbon Neutrality, will gather over 300 exhibitors from 12 countries and regions at AsiaWorld-Expo from October 28 to 31, 2025. The event serves as a critical platform for advancing global carbon reduction efforts through the showcase of cutting-edge environmental technologies and solutions across three key areas: Circular Economy and Waste Management, Green & Smart Mobility, and ESG-related Services.</p><p>HKTDC Deputy Executive Director Jenny Koo emphasized the event's significance in light of China's commitment to reduce economy-wide net greenhouse gas emissions by 7-10% from peak levels by 2035. This ambitious target, announced by President Xi Jinping at the United Nations Climate Summit, creates substantial demand for environmental products and technologies. The expo's timing aligns with Hong Kong's renewed focus on green policy directions, including fostering low-carbon living environments and promoting green technology applications.</p><p>International participation highlights the global nature of the climate challenge, with Korea and Italy staging group participations for the first time. The Korea pavilion will feature solutions in air purification, deodorisation, water quality management and waste treatment. Returning participants include Norway, the Netherlands and Canada, while Chinese Mainland representation expands to include Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Guangxi, Hunan, Shanghai and Inner Mongolia. The ANSO Environmental Technology Industry Alliance, led by the Alliance of National and International Science Organizations for the Belt and Road Regions, makes its debut with 11 mainland enterprises showcasing water resources and atmospheric environment technologies.</p><p>Innovative solutions on display include Green AI Technology Limited's smart sorting bin powered by machine vision and AI algorithms, and China Everbright Environment Group Limited's waste-to-energy solutions that transform waste into resources. In the Green & Smart Mobility sector, CUHK-incubated start-up Luquos Energy Limited will showcase the world's first commercialised sulphur-based flow battery energy storage system, offering nearly half the cost of lithium batteries. First-time exhibitor Infore Enviro Technology Group Co., Ltd will display its electric compactor truck, representing the shift toward electrified urban services.</p><p>The expo addresses the growing demand for ESG-related services as industries seek low-carbon transformation. CECEP (Hong Kong) Investment Co. Ltd. will showcase EnvAI, an innovative tool providing businesses with one-stop ESG services including data collection, analysis and automated report generation. Llewellyn and Partners Company Limited will present AutoTwin, a patented AI-powered integrated management platform for the construction industry that optimizes energy efficiency and reduces carbon footprints.</p><p>The highlight Eco Asia Conference will bring together government representatives from the Chinese Mainland and Belt and Road countries alongside global industry leaders to share latest policies, projects and insights. Key sessions include the launch of the Hong Kong Circular Built Environment Guidebook and discussions on achieving net-zero built environments and future transportation systems. Additional events include the 6th Hydrogen Economy Forum featuring representatives from Towngas and experts from the Chinese Mainland and overseas, and the Experience Sharing Forum on Promoting Environmental Business in Overseas Markets.</p><p>To encourage public engagement, the final day on October 31 will be designated as Public Day with complimentary admission.
