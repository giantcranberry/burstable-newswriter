<p>D1 Training has expanded into Forsyth County with a new location at 2569 Peachtree Pkwy, continuing the fitness concept's national growth through franchising. The facility employs a sports-science backed training regimen led by certified trainers designed to help people of all ages achieve their sport and fitness goals. Adam and Mindy Pure, owners of D1 Training South Forsyth, represent the growing network of franchisees that includes professional athletes and notable partners.</p><p>For the Pures, opening the facility represented more than a business decision—it aligned with their family lifestyle and commitment to helping young athletes develop confidence both on and off the field. We've seen firsthand how sports and structured training build confidence, character, and resilience, said Adam Pure. Our goal is to create a space where families grow stronger together—where kids, teens, and adults are challenged, supported, and inspired every step of the way.</p><p>The Pures bring complementary backgrounds to their new venture. Adam developed his belief in team culture and purpose-driven organizations through years of business management, while Mindy's experience in retail leadership, education, and community involvement provides a foundation of empathy and youth development focus. Their combined approach aligns with D1 Training's core values of building strength through structured athletic development.</p><p>D1 Training offers four age-based programs including Rookie for ages 7-11, Developmental for ages 12-14, Prep for ages 15-18, and D1 Adult. Each program follows the five athletic-based tenets: dynamic warm-up, performance, strength program, core and conditioning, and cool down. Beyond group workouts, the facility provides group, semi-private, and one-on-one training with certified coaches.</p><p>Adam and Mindy are the ideal candidates to bring the D1 Training experience to the Cumming and Suwanee area, said Dan Murphy, the brand's Chief Operating Officer. We're confident in their ability to show the Forsyth area what they've been missing out on. D1 is a one-of-a-kind fitness experience that's built around the individual and meant to help people meet their athletic goals.</p><p>The expansion reflects D1 Training's strategic growth through franchising, with more than 100 performance centers currently open and over 100 additional locations in development nationwide. The brand continues seeking qualified business builders, former athletes, and entrepreneurs who share a passion for fitness and youth sports.
