<p>Ross Stores, operator of the largest off-price retail chain in the United States, will open four new Ross Dress for Less stores in the Detroit area on October 11th as part of a broader national expansion strategy. The expansion represents a significant investment in the Michigan retail market and will bring the company's statewide presence to 23 locations.</p><p>Richard Lietz, Executive Vice President of Property Development, stated that the company is excited to grow its presence in the Detroit area and reach more customers with high quality merchandise, great brands, and incredible savings. The expansion includes a community investment component, with the company planning to donate $20,000 to local Boys & Girls Clubs and The Carpenter Elementary School via First Book Marketplace.</p><p>The new stores will be located at 23647 Greenfield Rd. in Southfield, 3181 Fairlane Dr. in Allen Park, 8393 W. Grand River Ave. in Brighton, and 3675 Washtenaw Ave. in Ann Arbor. Each location will operate with varying hours, with most stores open until 10:00 p.m. or later throughout the week.</p><p>Each of the four new stores ranges from 22,000 to 23,500 square feet in size and is expected to create between 55-60 jobs per location, consisting of both full- and part-time positions. This translates to approximately 220-240 new employment opportunities across the Detroit metropolitan area.</p><p>In support of the grand openings, the company will make donations to multiple local charitable organizations including The Boys & Girls Clubs of Southeastern Michigan at both the Lloyd H. Diehl Club and Dick & Sandy Dauch Campus NFL/YET locations, The Boys & Girls Club of Greater Flint - Peak Extension, and The Carpenter Elementary School through First Book Marketplace.</p><p>Ross Stores, Inc. is an S&P 500, Fortune 500, and Nasdaq 100 company that operates Ross Dress for Less, the largest off-price apparel and home fashion chain in the United States with 1,873 locations nationwide. The company offers first-quality, in-season name brand and designer merchandise at savings of 20% to 60% off department and specialty store regular prices.
