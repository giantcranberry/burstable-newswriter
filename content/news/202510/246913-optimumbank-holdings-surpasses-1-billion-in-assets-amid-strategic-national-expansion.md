<p>OptimumBank Holdings Inc. (NYSE American: OPHC) reported second-quarter 2025 earnings of $3.6 million, achieving a significant financial milestone as the institution surpassed $1 billion in total assets. The bank holding company, which owns 100% of community bank OptimumBank, also revealed that deposits have been growing at a double-digit annualized pace, indicating strong customer acquisition and retention in the competitive Florida banking market.</p><p>The financial achievements come as OptimumBank prepares to step onto the national stage with scheduled appearances at two high-profile conferences in October. Chairman Moishe Gubin will present third-quarter highlights at the LD Micro Main Event XIX in San Diego from October 19-21, providing investors with direct access to the bank's leadership and strategic outlook. The conference engagements highlight OptimumBank's strategy of building visibility among investors, business leaders, and community stakeholders while reinforcing its recent financial progress according to company announcements available at <a href="https://ibn.fm/rRYiQ" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://ibn.fm/rRYiQ</a>.</p><p>Following the San Diego investor conference, OptimumBank will sponsor and attend the Jewish National Fund Global Conference in Hollywood, Florida, from October 23-26. This dual-conference approach demonstrates the bank's commitment to engaging with both investment communities and broader community stakeholders. The bank recently sponsored the 2025 Brokers Expo in New York, underscoring its ongoing outreach to small businesses and commercial clients.</p><p>Founded in 2000, OptimumBank has gradually expanded its reach as a community-focused financial institution headquartered in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. The bank is currently one of the few Florida-based community banks regularly featured on national investor stages, reflecting its growing prominence in the regional banking sector. The institution's participation in a diverse slate of events suggests a concerted effort to elevate its profile beyond traditional community banking boundaries while maintaining its local market focus.</p><p>The combination of strong financial performance and strategic national visibility initiatives positions OptimumBank for potential growth opportunities in both retail and commercial banking segments. The bank's ability to exceed $1 billion in assets represents a significant threshold in the banking industry, often associated with enhanced operational capabilities and competitive positioning. For business leaders and investors monitoring regional banking trends, OptimumBank's trajectory demonstrates how community banks can successfully scale while maintaining their core market focus through strategic national engagement.</p>
