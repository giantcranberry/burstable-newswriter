<p>Energy Fuels Inc. will host a conference call on Tuesday, November 4, 2025, at 9 a.m. Mountain Time to discuss its third quarter 2025 financial results. The company, recognized as a leading U.S. producer of uranium, rare earth elements, and other critical minerals, will issue a press release containing detailed results and operational highlights prior to the scheduled call. The conference will feature a management presentation followed by a question-and-answer session, providing investors and stakeholders with comprehensive insights into the company's performance and strategic direction.</p><p>This earnings discussion comes at a time when global demand for critical minerals continues to grow, particularly for applications in clean energy and advanced technologies. Energy Fuels has established itself as the leading U.S. producer of natural uranium concentrate over recent years, supplying nuclear utilities that process the material for carbon-free nuclear energy generation. The company's consistent production and strategic positioning in the critical minerals sector make these quarterly updates particularly significant for market observers and energy industry stakeholders.</p><p>The company's operations extend beyond uranium to include rare earth elements, heavy mineral sands, vanadium, and medical isotopes. Energy Fuels owns and operates the White Mesa Mill in Utah, which represents the only fully licensed and operating conventional uranium processing facility in the United States. At this facility, the company produces advanced rare earth element products and vanadium oxide when market conditions warrant. Additionally, Energy Fuels is evaluating the potential recovery of certain medical isotopes from existing uranium process streams, which could contribute to emerging Targeted Alpha Therapy cancer treatments.</p><p>Energy Fuels is also developing three heavy mineral sands projects internationally: the Toliara Project in Madagascar, the Bahia Project in Brazil, and the Donald Project in Australia. For the Donald Project, Energy Fuels has the right to earn up to a 49% interest in a joint venture with Astron Corporation Limited. These expansion efforts demonstrate the company's commitment to diversifying its critical minerals portfolio and strengthening its position in global markets. The upcoming earnings call will likely address progress on these development projects and their potential impact on the company's long-term growth strategy.
