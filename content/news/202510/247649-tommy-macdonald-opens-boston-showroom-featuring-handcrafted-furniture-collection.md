<p>Boston native Tommy MacDonald, former host of Rough Cut: Woodworking with Tommy Mac on PBS, has established his first public showroom at 155 Federal Street in Boston's Financial District. The new space serves as a comprehensive display for his signature collection of rockers, armchairs, kitchen stools, live edge tables, beds, and other furniture pieces, all handcrafted at his North End workshop using premium North American hardwoods.</p><p>With increasing consumer interest in locally manufactured, high-quality furniture, MacDonald recognized an opportunity to establish a physical location where customers could personally experience his craftsmanship. The showroom functions as more than a retail space, featuring not only MacDonald's work but also pieces from other Massachusetts-based artists and craftsmen, celebrating the state's design traditions. MacDonald emphasized the local connection, stating, "I was born and raised in Boston, and everything I make carries that spirit. It's real, built to last, and meant to be lived with."</p><p>The centerpiece of the collection is the luxury arts-and-crafts-inspired rocker named after MacDonald's mother, Millie, honoring her affection for rocking chairs. This distinctive piece combines aesthetic appeal with functional comfort, featuring sequentially matched boards that ensure each rocker maintains unique characteristics. Constructed using traditional joinery techniques including through-mortise wedged tenons and bent-laminated rockers, the rocker exemplifies MacDonald's commitment to quality craftsmanship. The seating incorporates a nine-spring, eight-tie foundation topped with plush down cushions, all upholstered in premium natural fabrics and leathers.</p><p>Michael Nichols, President of the Downtown Boston Alliance, welcomed MacDonald's addition to the downtown community, noting that "Tommy joins a community of makers who have chosen Downtown Boston as the place to showcase their workmanship to the millions of people who visit each month." The showroom's location in the Financial District positions it to reach both local residents and the substantial visitor population that frequents downtown Boston.</p><p>Beyond the signature rocker, the collection includes versatile armchairs with wide functional arms and multiple reclining settings, along with timeless kitchen stools crafted with single-board seats and wedged tenon joints for both comfort and durability. Each piece remains handmade in Massachusetts in limited quantities, ensuring authenticity and longevity.

This expansion represents MacDonald's continued commitment to Massachusetts craftsmanship while addressing consumer demand for furniture that combines artistic integrity with practical durability.</p>
