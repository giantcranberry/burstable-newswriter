<p>Critical Metals Corp has secured $50 million in funding through a private investment in public equity transaction with a fundamental institutional investor. The mining development company will use the net proceeds to advance development of its Tanbreez rare earth deposit in Greenland, which contains an estimated 4.7 billion metric tons of rare earth resources.</p><p>The financing transaction involves issuing 1.47 million ordinary shares and pre-funded warrants to purchase approximately 1.56 million additional shares. This capital infusion strengthens the company's balance sheet and demonstrates significant investor confidence as Critical Metals Corp advances its strategic portfolio of critical mineral assets. The securities being sold have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933 and may not be offered or sold in the United States without registration or an applicable exemption.</p><p>Tony Sage, CEO and Chairman of Critical Metals Corp, emphasized that the proceeds will support development efforts at Tanbreez, one of the world's largest rare earth deposits in Greenland. The project is expected to help address growing Western demand for heavy rare earths, which are essential components for defense applications, clean energy transition, and next-generation technologies.</p><p>The company's strategic positioning comes at a critical time as Western nations seek to reduce dependence on foreign sources of rare earth minerals. Critical Metals Corp's portfolio positions it to become a reliable supplier of these essential materials to Western markets. The Tanbreez project features year-round direct shipping access via deep water fjords leading to the North Atlantic Ocean, providing significant logistical advantages for global distribution.</p><p>Jett Capital Advisors, LLC and Cohen & Company Capital Markets acted as placement agents for the private placement, while White & Case LLP served as legal counsel to Critical Metals Corp. Beyond the Greenland project, the company's Wolfsberg Lithium Project in Austria represents another key asset, being the first fully permitted lithium mine in Europe with established infrastructure access.

The development of Tanbreez could significantly impact global rare earth markets by providing Western manufacturers and defense contractors with alternative sourcing options for materials crucial to electric vehicles, renewable energy systems, and advanced military technologies.</p>
