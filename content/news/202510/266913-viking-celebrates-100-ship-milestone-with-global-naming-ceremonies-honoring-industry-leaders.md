<p>Viking has reached a significant operational milestone by now managing more than 100 ships across its river, ocean, and expedition fleet. The company marked this achievement with a global naming celebration spanning six countries, officially welcoming nine new river vessels with ceremonies that emphasized Viking's commitment to cultural discovery and partnership with travel advisors.</p><p>One of the most notable honors went to Michele Saegesser, Viking's Vice President of Trade Development & Training, who was named Godmother of the new Viking Honir during ceremonies in Basel, Switzerland. The name Honir derives from Norse mythology, where the god Honir represented wisdom, reflection, and reason—attributes that align with Saegesser's decades of dedication to travel advisors. Her mentorship and educational leadership have been instrumental in shaping Viking's world-leading reputation through steadfast support for industry partners.</p><p>Heather Viking, a dedicated travel advisor at Club Cruise™, emphasized the significance of honoring internal leaders rather than relying on celebrity-driven marketing. She noted that celebrating the leaders who shape the guest experience demonstrates genuine loyalty and reflects why advisors honor leaders like Saegesser who believe strongly in Viking's mission.</p><p>The newly named river ships include Viking Annar with Godmother Michelle Patterson, Viking Dagur with Godmother Sara Conley, Viking Eldir with Godmother Yumi Kim, Viking Nerthus with Godmother Allison Becker, Viking Gyda with Godmother Chitra Goswami, Viking Tonle with Godmother Laura Perlman, Viking Thoth with Godfather Youssef Fouad Amin, and Viking Amun with Godfather Sherif El Banna. Guests at the ceremonies enjoyed cultural performances reflecting Viking's hallmark of enrichment experiences.</p><p>Amanda Huber, CEO of Club Cruise™ and an internationally recognized luxury cruise expert, highlighted how Saegesser's leadership ensures advisors are heard, respected, and supported, ultimately benefiting every Viking guest through knowledgeable care. She noted increasing demand for Viking World Cruises and immersive Asia itineraries across 2026–2027 travel planning. Later this week, Heather and Amanda will join Saegesser aboard the Viking Yi Dun for the Jewels of Japan & China Ocean Executive Training Retreat, designed to strengthen expertise and enhance media coverage for future travelers.</p><p>Viking's founding leadership, including Chairman Torstein Hagen and Karine Hagen, has maintained focus on culture, history, and genuine discovery, revolutionizing river experiences while evolving ocean and expedition travel. This consistent vision has contributed to Viking being recognized as the most awarded cruise line globally, holding top rankings from Condé Nast Traveler, Travel + Leisure, U.S. News & World Report, Forbes Travel Guide, and Cruise Critic.
