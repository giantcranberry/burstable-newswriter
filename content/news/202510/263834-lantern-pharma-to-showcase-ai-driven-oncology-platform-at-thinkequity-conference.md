<p>Lantern Pharma management will present at the ThinkEquity Conference on October 30, 2025, at the Mandarin Oriental in New York, highlighting the company's progress in using artificial intelligence to transform oncology drug discovery and development. The presentation will focus on the company's proprietary AI and machine learning platform, RADR®, which leverages over 200 billion oncology-focused data points and utilizes more than 200 advanced ML algorithms to address significant challenges in cancer drug development.</p><p>The RADR® platform represents a fundamental shift in how cancer therapies are discovered and developed, potentially reducing both the time and cost traditionally associated with bringing new oncology treatments to market. This technological approach could significantly accelerate the development timeline for cancer therapies while lowering the substantial financial investments typically required in pharmaceutical research. The company's growing pipeline includes multiple development programs spanning various cancer indications, including both solid tumors and blood cancers, along with an antibody-drug conjugate program.</p><p>Lantern Pharma currently has a Phase 2 clinical program and multiple Phase 1 clinical trials underway, demonstrating the practical application of its AI-driven approach. The full scope of the company's development activities and platform capabilities can be reviewed in their corporate newsroom at <a href="https://ibn.fm/LTRN" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://ibn.fm/LTRN</a>. The potential market impact of Lantern Pharma's AI-driven pipeline is substantial, with estimated combined annual market potential exceeding $15 billion across its development programs.</p><p>Beyond financial implications, the company's approach could provide life-changing therapies to hundreds of thousands of cancer patients worldwide by accelerating the development of targeted treatments. This acceleration addresses critical unmet medical needs in oncology, where traditional drug development timelines often span decades. The conference presentation will provide investors and industry observers with insights into how artificial intelligence is reshaping cancer drug development and creating new opportunities for addressing these medical challenges.</p><p>Additional details about the conference presentation and the company's broader strategic initiatives are available through the official press release at <a href="https://ibn.fm/QSF41" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://ibn.fm/QSF41</a>. The conference presentation represents an important opportunity for the company to demonstrate how its AI platform is advancing multiple therapeutic candidates through clinical development while potentially setting new standards for efficiency in oncology research. This demonstration comes at a time when the pharmaceutical industry increasingly recognizes the transformative potential of AI in drug discovery and development processes.</p>
