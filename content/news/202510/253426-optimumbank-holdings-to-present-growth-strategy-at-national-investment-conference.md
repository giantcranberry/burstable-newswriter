<p>OptimumBank Holdings, Inc. (NYSE American: OPHC) will present at the 19th Annual LD Micro Main Event on October 20, 2025, at the Hotel del Coronado in San Diego, California.

Gubin emphasized that the bank has reached a point where its growth story resonates well beyond Florida, stating that the LD Micro Main Event provides an ideal platform to showcase how disciplined execution, strong balance sheet management, and a community-first model are fueling sustainable expansion. This development reflects the increasing investor interest in community banking models that combine personalized service with growth strategies in an era dominated by large financial institutions.</p><p>The LD Micro Main Event brings together leading small-cap companies and investors for presentations and networking opportunities, providing OptimumBank with access to a broader investment community. The bank's participation comes as it maintains its commitment to traditional, in-person banking services while incorporating modern digital convenience, positioning itself as a hybrid model that appeals to both traditional banking customers and those seeking contemporary financial services.</p><p>Founded in 2000 in Ft. Lauderdale, Florida, by local Broward County businessmen, OptimumBank emerged as a response to the rise of out-of-state mega-banks, aiming to restore true community banking values. The bank's financial solutions include Business Banking, Business Lending, SBA Lending Solutions, Treasury Management, and Personal Banking, with particular expertise in real estate and commercial lending. This specialized focus has contributed to the bank's growth while maintaining its community-oriented approach.</p><p>For investors seeking additional information, the company maintains a newsroom at <a href="https://ibn.fm/OPHC" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://ibn.fm/OPHC</a> where they can access the latest updates.

This development has broader implications for the banking industry, suggesting that community banking models combining personalized service with sustainable growth strategies are gaining traction among investors seeking alternatives to large financial institutions.
