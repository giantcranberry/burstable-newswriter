<p>JETSET Pilates is expanding its Florida presence with a new studio opening in Dr. Phillips this November, marking the second Orlando-area location for franchise owners Austin and Vinitha Wolak. The 2,100-square-foot facility at 7940 Via Dellagio Way, Suite 112 represents continued growth for the modern Reformer Pilates franchise known for premium full-body workouts. The Dr. Phillips opening comes at a strategic time, with Orlando recently ranking as the healthiest city in Florida, creating ideal conditions for premium fitness offerings.</p><p>The Wolaks noted that community social gatherings and events in the area increasingly center around health and wellness, reflecting broader consumer trends toward prioritizing fitness and well-being. The studio will offer 50-minute high-end classes on custom reformers that combine strength, cardio, and Pilates-inspired movements set to DJ-curated music, designed to strengthen, lengthen, and energize both body and mind. This expansion demonstrates how fitness brands are targeting health-conscious markets where consumer demand for premium wellness experiences is growing.</p><p>Vinitha Wolak, who grew up in Orlando, discovered Pilates personally and was immediately drawn to the workout after her first class. Her extensive research into more than 15 different Pilates brands led her to JETSET Pilates, which she found offered an unmatched workout experience with strong quality control across locations. My deep family ties in the community made bringing JETSET Pilates to Orlando a natural fit, said Vinitha. Opening studios with JETSET Pilates allows me to bring something I'm deeply passionate about to the community that shaped me.</p><p>Austin Wolak, originally from Sarasota, was introduced to Pilates by his wife and quickly became a dedicated client himself. The couple's shared background as quality engineers in the medical device and pharmaceutical industries made them appreciate JETSET's model and high standards. Their Winter Park location has received fantastic community reception according to Tamara Galinsky, Founder and Brand President of JETSET Pilates, who expressed excitement about their continued expansion in Orlando. The new Dr. Phillips studio will celebrate with a grand opening celebration in early December featuring vendors, giveaways, food, a live DJ, and access to discounted Founding Memberships available for a limited time at $199 per month.

This expansion strategy highlights how fitness franchises are capitalizing on demographic trends and regional health rankings to drive growth. The move also reflects the increasing premiumization of the fitness industry, where consumers are willing to pay for specialized, high-quality workout experiences that combine physical conditioning with mental wellness benefits. As health-conscious communities continue to emerge as attractive markets for fitness brands, similar expansion patterns are likely to occur in other regions prioritizing wellness lifestyles.</p>
