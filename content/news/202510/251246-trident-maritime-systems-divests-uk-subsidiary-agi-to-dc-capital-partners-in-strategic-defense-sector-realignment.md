<p>Trident Maritime Systems, a portfolio company of investment affiliates of J.F. Lehman & Company, has completed the divestiture of Trident Maritime Systems UK Limited and its subsidiaries to DC Capital Partners. The transaction includes Aeronautical & General Instruments Limited (AGI), a significant player in naval electronics with a legacy dating back to 1915. This strategic move enables both companies to position themselves for future growth in the defense maritime sector while addressing specific market opportunities.</p><p>The acquisition by DC Capital Partners, a private equity firm specializing in middle market government and engineering companies, represents a strategic fit for AGI's defense-focused operations. AGI provides highly engineered systems that support landing, navigation, communications and other mission-critical applications for naval fleets worldwide. The company maintains strong technical expertise and relationships with U.S., U.K. and Allied naval forces globally, making it an attractive asset for DC Capital's portfolio, which can be viewed at <a href="http://www.dccp.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.dccp.com</a>.</p><p>Joe Mullen, Chief Executive Officer of Trident, emphasized the strategic rationale behind the divestiture, noting that it will enable Trident to sharpen its focus on serving core U.S. customers. This move comes at a critical time when the U.S. Navy is pursuing robust shipbuilding and sustainment plans, creating significant opportunities for specialized maritime systems providers. The timing aligns with increased defense spending and naval modernization initiatives across multiple allied nations.</p><p>David Hyde, AGI CEO, highlighted the successful partnership with JFLCO and Trident while expressing optimism about the company's future under DC Capital's ownership. The transition represents an opportunity for AGI to capitalize on emerging market opportunities and continue its legacy of technical excellence in naval systems. The acquisition aligns with DC Capital's focus on government and engineering companies, suggesting potential synergies and growth avenues for AGI's specialized capabilities.</p><p>The transaction involved KippsDeSanto & Co. as financial advisor to Trident, with Jones Day providing legal counsel. Trident Maritime Systems, headquartered in Arlington, VA, continues to operate as a comprehensive systems and solutions provider to government and commercial shipbuilders and operators worldwide. The company maintains strategic operating locations near major naval and commercial shipbuilders across the U.S. and internationally.</p><p>J.F. Lehman & Company, the private equity firm behind Trident, maintains its focus on aerospace, defense, maritime, government and environmental investments through its offices in New York and Washington, D.C.
