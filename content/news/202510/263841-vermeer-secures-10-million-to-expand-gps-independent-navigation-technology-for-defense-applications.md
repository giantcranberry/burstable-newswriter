<p>Vermeer, an American-Ukrainian startup specializing in vision navigation and autonomy technologies for defense applications, has closed a $10 million Series A funding round led by Draper Associates. The investment included participation from AeroX Ventures, Boscolo Intervest, High Point Ventures, Rockaway Ventures, and the U.S. Air Force Techstars accelerator program. This capital infusion will support the expansion of Vermeer's partnerships with U.S. military forces, NATO allies, and the Armed Forces of Ukraine while scaling its optical navigation technology for both defense and commercial sectors.</p><p>The company's Visual Positioning System technology offers a GPS-independent navigation solution critical for drones and other aerial vehicles operating in contested or GPS-denied environments. The VPS system employs multiple electro-optical or infrared cameras to interpret the surrounding environment by comparing live visuals against a database of landmarks and pre-existing maps, enhanced by AI processing via Nvidia chips. This approach allows drones to maintain precise location awareness even when GPS signals are jammed or spoofed, a vulnerability commonly exploited in modern conflicts.</p><p>Vermeer's technology is already deployed with over 30 customers including the U.S. Army, U.S. Air Force, Lockheed Martin, and Northrop Grumman, with active deployment by Ukrainian forces to maintain drone efficacy against adversarial electronic warfare. The company has grown from 10 to 40 employees within a year while maintaining operations in both New York and Kyiv. CEO Brian Streem emphasized that operating in a war zone has forced the company to iterate faster and focus on what actually works in combat situations.</p><p>The startup credits its early development phase to the U.S. Air Force's Techstars accelerator and significant non-dilutive Small Business Innovation Research funding through the AFWERX program. As geopolitical tensions and cyber-electronic warfare continue to intensify, navigation solutions resistant to jamming and spoofing represent a vital niche within drone and autonomous platform sectors. While Vermeer's funding round is modest compared to other defense tech startups, its focus on navigation resilience addresses a specific and critical capability gap in modern military operations.</p><p>The implications of this technology extend beyond immediate defense applications. As commercial drone operations expand into areas with potential signal interference, and as autonomous vehicle technology advances, reliable GPS-independent navigation becomes increasingly essential. Vermeer's approach demonstrates how real-world battlefield testing can accelerate technological innovation, potentially setting new standards for reliability in autonomous systems across multiple industries.</p>
