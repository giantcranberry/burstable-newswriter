<p>Standard Premium Finance, a Miami-based specialty finance company, has increased its credit facility to $115 million to support continued expansion and loan originations. The company, which provides collateralized loans for property and casualty insurance premiums, has built a portfolio exceeding $1.5 billion since its founding in 1991.</p><p>CEO and Chairman William Koppelmann emphasized that the expanded credit facility signals confidence from lending partners in the company's business model and financial discipline. Expanding our revolving credit facility provides the liquidity we need to fund more loan originations and support our growth strategy, Koppelmann stated. The company trades on the OTCQX market under the symbol SPFX.</p><p>The company's growth strategy includes geographic expansion, demonstrated by the recent hiring of industry veteran Renee Magness to cover the Midwest market. Koppelmann noted that the Midwest represents significant growth potential, and Magness brings extensive experience and customer relationships that will help the company expand its footprint beyond its Florida roots.</p><p>Financial performance has been strong, with the company reporting a 25% year-over-year revenue increase in 2024 and an 84% surge in net income compared to 2023. Loan originations have continued growing at double-digit rates during 2025, according to public filings available through the company's website at <a href="https://www.standardpremiumfinance.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.standardpremiumfinance.com</a>.</p><p>Despite rapid growth, Koppelmann emphasized maintaining underwriting discipline as fundamental to managing credit risk. The company combines decades of industry experience with proprietary data analytics to ensure consistent underwriting standards. Geographic diversification also helps distribute regulatory and market risk across multiple states.</p><p>Technology plays a central role in the company's competitive strategy, with proprietary systems enabling integration with agent and carrier management systems while providing customer portals for self-service and transparency. Koppelmann described technological capabilities as increasingly essential in the premium finance industry, where digital experiences and automated systems have become requirements rather than optional features.</p><p>Looking ahead, Standard Premium Finance aims to uplist to NASDAQ to increase shareholder liquidity and market visibility. The company is also exploring synergistic opportunities within the broader specialty finance space beyond insurance premium financing. Koppelmann identified service, transparency, technology, financial stability and partnership approach as key differentiators that separate top-tier premium finance providers from competitors.</p><p>The company maintains its headquarters in Miami, which Koppelmann described as a dynamic market with strong financial services presence and growing innovation ecosystem. Standard Premium Finance continues to balance expansion with risk management while focusing on providing payment flexibility for businesses and individuals needing insurance coverage.</p>
