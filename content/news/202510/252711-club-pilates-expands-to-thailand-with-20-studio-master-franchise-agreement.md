<p>Club Pilates, the world's largest Pilates brand, has executed a Master Franchise Agreement in Thailand with plans to establish 20 studios across Bangkok, the municipality, and Chonburi Province. This strategic move represents the brand's expansion into its 22nd international market, with the inaugural Thai studio scheduled to launch in Bangkok during the upcoming spring season.</p><p>The agreement was formalized with Me In Motion Co., Ltd., under the leadership of CEO Thanayous Kositsakul and his wife Varissara Kositsakul. The couple brings over thirty years of operational expertise from managing Toyota dealerships in Thailand, complemented by extensive experience in international retail and franchise management. Their previous venture, TAFF Co., Ltd., handled distribution for prominent global brands including Callaway Golf, Taylormade, Cobra-Puma Golf, Acushnet, Adidas, and Billabong, providing substantial background in both fitness and golf apparel sectors.</p><p>Bob Kaufman, President of International at Xponential Fitness, highlighted the strategic significance of the Thai market expansion, describing Thailand as a robust, trend-setting environment where Pilates is experiencing growing popularity. Kaufman emphasized that the Kositsakuls' demonstrated success in developing global brands, combined with their personal commitment to fitness and wellness, positions them as ideal partners to spearhead Club Pilates' growth throughout Thailand.</p><p>Thanayous Kositsakul expressed strong enthusiasm for introducing Club Pilates to Thai communities, characterizing the brand as the industry gold standard and noting its alignment with evolving wellness and lifestyle preferences in Thailand. This expansion occurs amid Club Pilates' continued rapid international growth, fueled by increasing consumer demand for Pilates as a low-impact, comprehensive workout that enhances strength, flexibility, and long-term health.</p><p>Currently operating 475 locations outside the United States and Canada across Europe, Asia-Pacific, and Latin America, Club Pilates focuses on making Pilates more accessible, approachable, and inclusive through premium instruction, advanced equipment, and community-oriented environments.
