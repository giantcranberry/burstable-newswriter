<p>The Nordex Group has revised its full-year 2025 EBITDA margin guidance upward, now projecting profitability in the range of 7.5 to 8.5%, compared to the previous guidance of 5.0 to 7.0%. This adjustment follows a review of preliminary third-quarter 2025 financial results and reflects improved operational performance across both project and service business segments.</p><p>Preliminary third-quarter 2025 results showed substantial improvement, with EBITDA reaching EUR 136 million at an 8.0% margin, nearly double the EUR 72 million and 4.3% margin recorded in the same period last year. Quarterly revenues are expected to be approximately EUR 1,706 million, broadly consistent with the prior year's EUR 1,671 million, despite seasonal dynamics and temporary supplier-related delays in Türkiye.</p><p>The company's financial position strengthened considerably during the period, with cash reserves increasing to EUR 1,378 million at the end of the third quarter, up from EUR 1,151 million at the end of 2024. Nordex generated free cash flow of EUR 298 million in the first nine months of 2025, compared to nil during the same period in 2024. Management expects positive free cash flow generation to continue in the fourth quarter, driven by additional profits, strong order intake momentum, and continued working capital improvement.</p><p>Jose Luis Blanco, CEO of Nordex Group, attributed the improved outlook to exceptional team performance. Our teams have delivered exceptionally well in Q3, and the results reflect the strength of our execution in the projects and service segments, Blanco stated. For the remainder of the year, we remain confident that we will be able to deliver a significant step up in profitability compared to 2024 levels.</p><p>Other elements of the full-year guidance remain unchanged, including sales expectations of EUR 7.4 to EUR 7.9 billion, working capital ratio below -9%, and capital expenditures of approximately EUR 200 million. The company will release its complete third-quarter 2025 results on November 4, 2025, following an analyst and investor call scheduled for October 28, 2025, to discuss the preliminary results and the rationale behind the upgraded outlook.

For business leaders and investors, Nordex's improved financial performance demonstrates that wind energy companies can achieve substantial profitability improvements even in challenging market conditions. The doubling of EBITDA margin year-over-year suggests operational efficiencies and cost management strategies are yielding significant results.</p><p>The implications extend beyond Nordex's immediate financial performance. The company's strengthened cash position and positive free cash flow generation indicate improved financial resilience, which could support further investment in technology development and market expansion. For the broader renewable energy industry, Nordex's success provides a positive indicator that wind turbine manufacturers can achieve sustainable profitability while contributing to global energy transition goals.</p><p>Industry observers will be watching how Nordex's improved performance influences competitor strategies and investor confidence in the renewable energy sector. The company's ability to maintain revenue levels while significantly improving profitability suggests effective management of both operational costs and pricing strategies in a competitive market environment.</p>
