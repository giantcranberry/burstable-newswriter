<p>Skiptown, a technology-enabled pet care facility offering dog daycare, boarding, grooming, and dog walking services, has launched franchising to expand its national footprint. The company is building on its corporate-owned locations in Charlotte, Atlanta, and Denver by inviting entrepreneurs to join its premium pet care concept. This strategic shift represents a significant evolution in the company's growth strategy as it moves beyond corporate-owned locations to establish a nationwide presence.</p><p>The timing aligns with substantial industry trends that underscore the market opportunity. According to the American Veterinary Medical Association, nearly half of U.S. households have a dog—approximately 90 million in total—making dogs the dominant household pet and fueling demand for specialized care services. This substantial market size creates significant expansion opportunities for pet service providers and positions Skiptown's franchising initiative to capitalize on growing consumer spending in the pet care sector.</p><p>Mike Rotondo, CEO of Skiptown, stated the company is proud to announce that Skiptown is now open for franchising, marking an exciting new chapter in their growth as they expand to meet the rising demand for personalized pet care. The company emphasizes its proprietary technology that enables convenient in-car drop-off and pick-up, as well as easy customization of appointments through their platform available at <a href="https://skiptown.io" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://skiptown.io</a>.</p><p>As part of its franchise launch, Skiptown is introducing new facility prototypes designed to deliver its signature services. The company is initially targeting growth in Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Kansas, Ohio, Tennessee, Texas, North Carolina, and South Carolina. Chief Development Officer Patti Rother, who brings extensive experience in scaling franchise brands, is leading the company's expansion strategy. Rother noted that Skiptown has demonstrated strong unit and growth performance and is entering franchising with proven programs and technology that set them apart in the industry.</p><p>The company has already welcomed more than 50,000 dogs across its three corporate locations, demonstrating the concept's viability and customer appeal. This established track record provides franchise candidates with confidence in the business model's potential for success. Skiptown is already seeing strong early interest in its franchising opportunity, with the company set to host its initial Meet the Team Day in Atlanta on October 22. Prospective franchise candidates can learn more about franchising opportunities at <a href="https://skiptown.io/franchising/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://skiptown.io/franchising/</a>.</p><p>This franchising initiative represents a pivotal moment for the pet care industry, where technology integration and premium service experiences are becoming increasingly important differentiators. The company's focus on technology-enabled services and premium pet care experiences distinguishes it in the competitive pet services market, which continues to grow alongside increasing pet ownership rates and consumer spending on pet care services. For business leaders and entrepreneurs, Skiptown's franchising model offers an opportunity to enter a growing market with an established brand and proven operational systems.</p>
