<p>Redcare Pharmacy N.V. reported preliminary third-quarter sales figures showing sustained growth momentum across both prescription and non-prescription segments, leading the company to reaffirm its full-year guidance. Total sales increased 25.2% to EUR 719 million in the third quarter, building on year-to-date growth of 27% to EUR 2.15 billion. This consistent performance signals the company's successful execution of its digital pharmacy strategy across European markets.</p><p>The company's prescription medication business showed particularly strong performance, with total Rx sales growing 42.3% to EUR 272 million. In Germany specifically, Rx sales surged 82.1% to EUR 126 million, demonstrating accelerating adoption of the company's prescription services. CEO Olaf Heinrich noted the company is delivering strong Q3 momentum, especially in German Rx where we grew double-digits quarter over quarter, and confirm full-year guidance. This German market acceleration represents a significant competitive advantage as digital healthcare adoption increases across Europe.</p><p>Non-prescription sales maintained steady growth, increasing 16.7% to EUR 448 million in the third quarter. Year-to-date non-Rx sales reached EUR 1.4 billion, representing 18% growth. The company's customer base expanded to 13.7 million active customers, while customer satisfaction metrics showed significant improvement with the net promoter score rising to well over 70 from 64 in the first half of the year. This combination of customer growth and satisfaction improvement indicates sustainable business momentum.</p><p>Both geographic segments contributed to the strong performance. The DACH segment (Germany, Austria and Switzerland) saw sales increase 25.2% to EUR 587 million, while the International segment (Belgium, Italy, France and the Netherlands) maintained a fast pace of growth with sales increasing 25.4% to EUR 132 million. Management confirmed that financial steering remains fully stable throughout the current transition period, with continuity ensured until the appointment of a new CFO. The balanced growth across regions suggests the company's business model translates effectively across different European healthcare markets.</p><p>The company's growth remains profitable and cash generative, with a solid Q3 EBITDA lifting the year-to-date margin already to the full-year guidance range of 2 to 2.5%. Entering the fourth quarter with accelerated Rx growth in Germany and the customary seasonal uplift in order volumes, the Group remains on track to achieve at least EUR 500 million Rx sales for the year. Redcare Pharmacy will release the full interim report for the third quarter of 2025 on October 29, 2025, available through their investor relations platform at <a href="https://www.redcare-pharmacy.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.redcare-pharmacy.com</a>. For business leaders and investors, these results demonstrate the growing market acceptance of digital pharmacy solutions and the potential for continued disruption in traditional healthcare delivery models across Europe.</p>
