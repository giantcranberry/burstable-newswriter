<p>Angkor Resources Corp. has received preliminary data from its seismic program in Cambodia's Block VIII, identifying what appears to be a substantial geological structure in the South Bokor Basin. The structure, named the South Bokor Lead, is an anticline with approximately 48 square kilometers of closure located between 900-1500 meters from the surface. Keith Edwards, Technical Manager of EnerCam, the company's Cambodian subsidiary, stated that the preliminary view shows a significant structure in the most southerly South Bokor Basin.</p><p>The company anticipates confirmation of internal structures upon completion of seismic processing and integrated geological and geophysical interpretation in November. Management has confirmed the South Bokor Lead as the first drill target identified from the seismic program. The anticline represents the first of four subbasins covered by the seismic program on Block VIII. The remaining data from other seismic areas is expected in segments by late October, with interpretation to follow.</p><p>The seismic program included 24 lines across three provinces, employing 38 Khmer residents and 15 contractors from Thailand using EnviroSeis equipment. Anticlines contribute to the majority of oil and gas discoveries globally, according to geological references from sources such as <a href="https://geowhy.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://geowhy.com</a>. However, trapping hydrocarbons requires an impermeable layer of rock on the top surface of the dome, which only drilling can confirm.</p><p>The mission for EnerCam is to discover Cambodia's first commercial onshore oil and gas, as the country currently imports all its hydrocarbon-based energy products, spending several billion dollars annually according to trade data from <a href="https://oec.world/en/profile/country/khm" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://oec.world/en/profile/country/khm</a>. Mike Weeks, President of EnerCam, emphasized that proving commercial oil and gas in Cambodia begins with seismic data providing sufficient information to determine drill targets. He noted that with no history of onshore drilling in Cambodia, the process of determining the best targets takes longer.</p><p>By year-end, the company expects to know if it can plan a multi-hole exploratory drill program for next year after covering the remaining three subbasins. Professional geologist Justin Snelling provided additional analysis, noting that preliminary views of seismic reflections across the top of the structure show mostly sub-parallel bedding with features suggesting a potential thick sealing mudstone band that could form an effective seal. Reflections within the anticline appear discontinuous, structurally complex, and display higher amplitudes, indicating possible significant reservoir rock development.</p><p>Additional processing and interpretation continues across all 24 lines of completed seismic data as the company works toward determining the viability of Cambodia's first onshore oil and gas resources. The successful development of domestic energy resources could significantly impact Cambodia's economy by reducing its dependence on imported energy and creating new revenue streams for the developing nation.</p>
