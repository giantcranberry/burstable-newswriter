<p>ESGold Corp. has confirmed that metallurgical work at its fully permitted Montauban Gold-Silver Project in Quebec has validated the company's processing strategy, establishing the Merrill Crowe closed circuit as the optimal processing path for all site feedstock, including railway tailings. The confirmation comes after gravity separation tests showed concentrate grades were insufficient for direct gold and silver pouring, leading to the determination that all material will be processed through the Merrill Crowe system during the final construction phase.</p><p>The results, supervised by Edmond St-Jean, P.Eng., and analyzed by ALS Global in Val-d'Or, represent a significant step forward in de-risking equipment procurement while supporting the ongoing mill construction, which the company reports is progressing ahead of schedule. This validation of the processing methodology provides greater certainty for the project's development timeline and operational planning. The full details of these findings are available in the company's official press release at <a href="https://ibn.fm/2WICY" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://ibn.fm/2WICY</a>.</p><p>ESGold also reported continued infrastructure expansion at the Montauban site, including progress on the gold room and laboratory facilities. These developments complement the completion of advanced 3D geological modeling that will guide an expanded exploration program. The comprehensive approach to project development demonstrates ESGold's systematic advancement toward production readiness at the Quebec-based operation.</p><p>The Montauban property, located 80 kilometers west of Quebec City, represents ESGold's flagship project and serves as a model for responsible mining practices according to company statements. The validation of the Merrill Crowe processing method provides critical technical confirmation for the project's operational framework, potentially accelerating the timeline toward production while reducing technical uncertainties that often challenge mining developments in their advanced stages. This development signals important progress for the mining sector in Quebec and provides investors with increased confidence in the project's technical viability and execution timeline.</p>
