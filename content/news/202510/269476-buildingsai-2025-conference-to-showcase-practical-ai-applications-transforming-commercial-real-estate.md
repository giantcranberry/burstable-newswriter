<p>The commercial real estate industry is undergoing a fundamental transformation as artificial intelligence reshapes how buildings are operated, secured, and optimized. Realcomm Conference Group will host the BuildingsAI 2025 conference on November 11 at the Paramount Club in New York City, providing practical insights into AI breakthroughs and proven applications currently transforming the built environment. This full-day event represents a critical opportunity for industry leaders to understand how AI is moving from theoretical concept to practical implementation across commercial properties.</p><p>The conference will feature comprehensive programming with technology leaders Microsoft and Google sharing their respective AI visions for the built environment. These sessions will provide attendees with strategic perspectives on how major technology companies are approaching AI integration in commercial real estate. The event will also showcase case studies from prominent real estate organizations including Related, Silverstein Properties, The RMR Group, QuadReal, Phillips Edison & Company, Boxer Property, Empire State Realty Trust, and Primaris REIT. These real-world examples will demonstrate how AI is actively transforming building operations and elevating tenant experiences through actual implementations rather than theoretical concepts.</p><p>Interactive discussions will focus on scaling AI across portfolios and connecting information technology with operational technology systems to achieve measurable results. This integration represents a significant challenge for many organizations, and the conference aims to provide practical solutions for bridging these traditionally separate domains. The event will also address the growing need for ethical implementation frameworks through guidance on responsible AI adoption and governance strategies. According to Jim Young, co-founder and CEO of Realcomm, the organization has been leading the AI conversation in commercial and corporate real estate for nearly a decade, long before it became an industry buzzword.</p><p>Young emphasized that since first exploring AI's potential in 2016, Realcomm has focused on turning artificial intelligence into practical solutions that make buildings smarter and more efficient. The BuildingsAI conference aims to cut through industry hype by providing real-world insights and proven approaches shared directly by leaders currently driving AI adoption.
