<p>D-Wave Quantum Inc. is expanding its European presence through a significant initiative in Italy that includes a €10 million contract for quantum computing infrastructure and educational programs. The company announced it is hosting a series of seminars in Italy aimed at advancing annealing quantum computing awareness and adoption among leading universities in the region as part of the newly formed Q-Alliance.</p><p>The Q-Alliance, revealed at last week's Digital Innovation Forum in Como, Italy, has been created to support the Italian government's strategic framework for digital and quantum technologies. As part of this collaboration, D-Wave announced a €10 million contract for a D-Wave Advantage2 annealing quantum computer in the region, ensuring accessibility for Italy's scientific community, academia, and industry. The agreement includes acquisition of 50% capacity of an Advantage2 system for five years with the option to purchase the full system.</p><p>Dr. Alan Baratz, CEO of D-Wave, emphasized the company's commitment to establishing Italy as a global hub of quantum innovation. As a founding member of the Q-Alliance, D-Wave is providing access to its commercial-grade quantum technologies and team of experts through the placement of a D-Wave system in the region along with ongoing hands-on workshops and training for Italy's researchers and academic community. The initial workshops are being held at the Università dell'Insubria and the Università della Svizzera Italiana.</p><p>The seminars are designed to accelerate education and awareness of quantum computing among Italy's growing ecosystem of young researchers through scholarships, internships, and training programs. This initiative represents a significant step in building Italy's quantum computing capabilities and positioning the country as a leader in quantum technology development. More information about D-Wave's quantum computing systems and services can be found at <a href="https://www.dwavequantum.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.dwavequantum.com</a>.</p><p>This expansion into Italy marks an important development in Europe's quantum computing landscape, providing Italian researchers and institutions with direct access to advanced quantum computing resources that were previously limited to select global locations. The partnership between D-Wave, the Italian government, and academic institutions through the Q-Alliance framework demonstrates how public-private collaborations can accelerate technological adoption and build national expertise in emerging fields.</p><p>For business and technology leaders, this development signals the accelerating globalization of quantum computing capabilities beyond traditional technology hubs. The €10 million investment represents a substantial commitment to building quantum infrastructure in Southern Europe, potentially creating new competitive dynamics in the European technology sector. The educational component through scholarships and training programs indicates a strategic approach to workforce development that could position Italy as a significant player in the quantum economy.</p><p>The placement of D-Wave's Advantage2 system in Italy provides regional access to commercial-grade quantum computing that was previously concentrated in North America and select European locations. This democratization of quantum access could accelerate research and development across multiple industries, from pharmaceuticals to finance, by reducing barriers to entry for Italian companies and research institutions. The five-year agreement structure suggests a long-term commitment to building sustainable quantum capabilities rather than short-term experimentation.</p>
