<p>The Phoenix office of JLL has completed the sale of a 13,547-square-foot industrial building in Gilbert, Arizona to owner-user buyer BAM Elite LLC on behalf of ViaWest Group. The $3,589,955 transaction represents a strategic divestiture from ViaWest's six-building industrial portfolio acquired in February 2024 and underscores a growing preference among operators to own rather than lease industrial space in the rapidly expanding metro Phoenix market.</p><p>Located at 2020 W. Guadalupe Rd., between Country Club Drive and McQueen Road, the flex industrial building features approximately 9,500 square feet of office space and a 4,000-square-foot evaporative cooled warehouse with grade-level loading and 16-foot clear height. The property sits in southwestern Gilbert, less than two miles from the US 60 Superstition Freeway, positioning it within one of metro Phoenix's most dynamic industrial corridors.</p><p>ViaWest Group Senior Vice President Alex Hondros noted that the sale enables a successful owner-user to continue their growth trajectory in the East Valley, mirroring ViaWest's own expansion strategy. The transaction allowed ViaWest to achieve an opportunistic return for investors by strategically exiting a portion of their 428,427-square-foot portfolio while meeting immediate market demand for owner-user properties.</p><p>JLL Vice Chairman Steve Larsen and Managing Director Jason Moore represented ViaWest Group in the transaction, while Lee & Associates Principal Conner Lee represented the buyer. Moore observed that stand-alone flex buildings in the sub-50,000-square-foot category face limited supply in metro Phoenix, with market interest consistently favoring purchase over lease options. Both parties recognized long-term value in the East Valley's industrial market, known for its quality of life and vigorous expansion in technology, advanced manufacturing, and aerospace sectors.</p><p>The remaining ViaWest East Valley portfolio maintains nearly 100% occupancy across five properties located at 955, 1171 and 1191 N. Fiesta Blvd., and 2075 and 2135 W. Obispo Ave. Only one building at 2135 W. Obispo Ave. offers 69,000 square feet available for sale or lease, with Larsen and Moore serving as exclusive brokers.

The firm managed approximately 18 million square feet of space and directed 36 projects through its Project and Development Services division, reinforcing its position as a dominant force in the region's commercial real estate landscape.</p>
