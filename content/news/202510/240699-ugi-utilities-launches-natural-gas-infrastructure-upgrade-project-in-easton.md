<p>UGI Utilities, Inc. has launched a natural gas main replacement initiative in Easton this week, representing another phase in the company's comprehensive infrastructure improvement program. The system upgrades demonstrate UGI's commitment to maintaining safe and reliable natural gas service for existing customers while simultaneously creating opportunities for additional properties to connect to the natural gas network.</p><p>The construction work will concentrate on several key streets in the Easton area, including West Wilkes Barre Street between Packer Street and Iron Street, Packer Street between Glendon Avenue and Hoyt Street, and McKeen Street between West Wilkes Barre Street and Hoyt Street. These underground improvements are scheduled to occur Monday through Friday from 7:00am to 5:00pm, with completion of the new natural gas main installation expected by the end of December, though weather and working conditions may impact this timeline.</p><p>Residents and business owners in the affected areas should anticipate significant disruptions, including road closures, detours, and parking restrictions throughout the project duration. The work will also require temporary interruptions to natural gas service, necessitating UGI technicians to access properties for equipment inspection and relighting procedures. Final paving and restoration activities will follow the main installation work.</p><p>Beyond infrastructure improvements, this project presents a valuable opportunity for properties along the construction route to convert to natural gas service. The timing allows for efficient connection to the upgraded system, potentially offering economic and environmental benefits to new customers. Additional information about UGI Utilities, Inc. and its services is available at <a href="https://www.ugi.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.ugi.com</a>.</p><p>The Easton project reflects UGI's broader strategy to modernize aging infrastructure across its service territory, which serves more than 760,000 customers. Such systematic upgrades help prevent service disruptions, enhance safety standards, and support community development by expanding access to reliable energy sources. The company's proactive approach to infrastructure investment demonstrates the utility sector's ongoing efforts to balance operational improvements with minimal community impact during construction phases.</p>
