<p>Allied Universal has promoted Taylor Carr to president of Allied Universal Technology Services, placing him at the helm of one of the largest security systems integrators in the United States. Carr brings more than 25 years of executive leadership and operational expertise in the security and technology services industry to this critical role, having previously served as executive vice president following the company's acquisition of Securadyne Systems.</p><p>The leadership transition comes as Carey Boethel departs to pursue new opportunities outside the security industry, though he will maintain his relationship with Allied Universal as an advocate and investor. Carr's extensive background includes a significant tenure as president of Vision Technologies, where he demonstrated transformational leadership by driving substantial revenue growth, implementing enterprise resource planning modernization, restructuring operations, and expanding service offerings to deliver improved profitability and long-term value.</p><p>Allied Universal Global Chairman and CEO Steve Jones emphasized Carr's qualifications, stating that throughout his career, Carr has consistently shown himself to be a strategic, solutions-driven leader who excels in operational management, M&A integration, and the development of high-performing teams. Jones noted that Carr's track record uniquely positions him to lead the company into its next chapter of growth and innovation.</p><p>This leadership appointment carries significant implications for the security technology industry, particularly given Allied Universal's massive scale as the third-largest private employer in North America and seventh in the world, with annual revenue of approximately $23 billion. The company serves as trusted partner to more than 400 of the Fortune 500 companies, delivering unparalleled customer relationships, innovative solutions, cutting-edge smart technologies and tailored services through its operations in over 100 countries and territories.</p><p>Carr's professional affiliations include membership in SIA (Security Industry Association) and ASIS International, organizations that represent the security industry's leading professionals and companies. His educational background includes a bachelor's degree in criminology and criminal justice from the University of Maryland.

As businesses worldwide face evolving security challenges, Carr's appointment positions Allied Universal Technology Services to drive innovation in an industry where technological advancement is becoming increasingly critical for protecting assets, data, and people across global operations.</p>
