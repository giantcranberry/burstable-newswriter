<p>Aditxt Inc. (NASDAQ: ADTX) will implement a 1-for-113 reverse stock split of its common stock effective at the opening of trading on November 3, 2025. The biotechnology company will see every 113 shares of issued and outstanding common stock convert into one share, with fractional shares being rounded up. The stock will continue trading under the symbol ADTX following this corporate action.</p><p>The reverse stock split received stockholder approval on September 23, 2025, and represents a strategic move to help the company regain compliance with Nasdaq's minimum bid price requirement. Maintaining compliance with exchange listing standards is crucial for publicly traded companies to ensure continued market access and investor confidence. Failure to meet these requirements can result in delisting, which typically reduces liquidity and makes it more challenging for companies to raise capital. The full details of the reverse stock split announcement are available in the official press release at <a href="https://ibn.fm/KgRGL" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://ibn.fm/KgRGL</a>.</p><p>Aditxt operates through a unique innovation platform that serves as the cornerstone of its strategy, where multiple disciplines drive disruptive growth and address significant societal challenges. The company's model democratizes innovation by ensuring every stakeholder's voice is heard and valued while empowering collective progress. Additional information about the company's developments can be found in their newsroom at <a href="https://ibn.fm/ADTX" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://ibn.fm/ADTX</a>.</p><p>Currently, Aditxt operates four distinct programs focused on autoimmunity, cancer and early disease detection, infectious diseases, and women's health. The company's mission to "Make Promising Innovations Possible Together" is supported by an ecosystem of research institutions, industry partners, and shareholders who collaboratively drive health innovation forward.</p><p>Reverse stock splits are commonly employed by companies facing challenges with their stock price falling below exchange minimum requirements. While such corporate actions don't fundamentally change the company's market capitalization, they can help restore compliance with listing standards and potentially improve the stock's perception among institutional investors who may have policies against investing in low-priced securities. For Aditxt, maintaining its Nasdaq listing is particularly important given its focus on advancing multiple health innovation programs that require sustained funding and market visibility.</p><p>The implications of this corporate action extend beyond mere compliance. For business leaders and technology investors, Aditxt's situation highlights the critical balance between innovation funding and market requirements. Biotechnology companies often face extended development timelines and significant capital requirements, making stable market access essential for long-term success. The reverse split represents a necessary step to preserve the company's ability to continue its work across multiple health domains while maintaining the investor confidence needed to support future growth initiatives.</p>
