<p>The CoLAB Method, founded by Thomas and Daniella Adisi, is launching its online acting training system in 2025, offering a pathway into the entertainment industry for students outside traditional coastal power centers. This program represents a significant shift in acting education accessibility, particularly for those from underrepresented regions and backgrounds. Neither founder came from Hollywood connections or industry privilege, having navigated what they describe as plenty of failures and learning the hard way what many dreamers face.</p><p>The CoLAB story originated in Milwaukee between 2016-2018, where Thomas ran acting classes alongside three seasons with the Milwaukee Repertory Theater. By 2018, they launched CoLAB Studio on Milwaukee's Upper East Side, attracting theater students and working adults seeking practical screen acting training. The program has now evolved into a comprehensive online system accessible through <a href="https://www.thecolabmethod.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.thecolabmethod.com</a>.</p><p>At the core of CoLAB's approach is the proprietary 3Ms framework: Mindset for developing confidence and resilience against rejection, Mastery for sharpening on-camera technique, and Marketplace for navigating branding and the business aspects of acting. The Adisis describe this framework as a time and opportunity multiplier that helps students progress with clarity and speed. This structured methodology addresses the comprehensive needs of modern actors beyond just performance skills.</p><p>The timing coincides with significant industry shifts following COVID-19, where digital auditions and self-tapes have become standard practice. Hollywood doesn't just live on the coasts anymore, says Daniella Adisi. It lives wherever you have a camera, a story, and the courage to show up. This transformation has created new opportunities for actors from small towns and rural areas who can now pursue careers without relocating to traditional entertainment hubs, potentially diversifying the talent pool and storytelling perspectives in the industry.</p><p>While designed primarily for actors, CoLAB's impact extends to other creative professionals and entrepreneurs seeking enhanced self-expression. The founders are developing their first book, blending their personal resilience story with the CoLAB framework to offer what they describe as a roadmap from being locked up to living in creative freedom. This expansion into broader creative development suggests applications beyond traditional acting careers.</p><p>The flagship program, 10XACTIVATE, includes 50 video lessons with live coaching and community masterminds. Students receive lifetime community access and a year of guided content, providing comprehensive training at a fraction of traditional program costs. The approach has proven effective for diverse students ranging from college actors to corporate professionals seeking creative development, indicating potential for cross-industry skill transfer and professional growth beyond entertainment.</p>
