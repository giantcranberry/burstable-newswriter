<p>Lahontan Gold Corp. has received C$4,316,948 from the exercise of warrants and stock options between July 4 and October 23, 2025, resulting in 334,420,221 common shares outstanding. The substantial capital infusion represents a significant vote of confidence from shareholders and positions the company for accelerated exploration activities in Nevada's prolific gold districts.</p><p>The proceeds will fund exploration and mine development at the company's Nevada projects, including the Santa Fe and West Santa Fe sites located in the Walker Lane gold belt. CEO Kimberly Ann stated that the exercises demonstrate strong shareholder confidence and leave Lahontan fully financed for its fall drilling programs while tightening the company's share structure for future growth. This financing approach through warrant and option exercises rather than traditional equity financing indicates existing shareholder commitment to the company's development strategy while minimizing dilution.</p><p>Lahontan's flagship property, the 26.4 kmÂ² Santa Fe Mine project, had past production of 359,202 ounces of gold and 702,067 ounces of silver between 1988 and 1995 from open pit mines utilizing heap-leach processing. The Santa Fe Mine currently holds a Canadian National Instrument 43-101 compliant Indicated Mineral Resource of 1,539,000 oz Au Eq and an Inferred Mineral Resource of 411,000 oz Au Eq, all pit constrained.

This financing milestone comes at a critical time for the company's development timeline in one of North America's most productive gold districts. The technical content of the company's disclosures has been reviewed and approved by Michael Lindholm, CPG, Independent Consulting Geologist to Lahontan Gold Corp., who is a Qualified Person as defined in National Instrument 43-101.

This approach strengthens the company's financial position while maintaining shareholder value through reduced dilution, positioning Lahontan Gold for potential growth in the competitive gold mining sector.</p>
