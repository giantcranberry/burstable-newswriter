<p>Tax Appeal Plus, the first purpose-built software for high-volume property tax professionals, has launched publicly to help firms simplify and scale their operations without spreadsheets or chaos. Created in 2005 by Erik Wind, the former President of GeoData Plus, the platform has quietly powered firms handling hundreds to thousands of property tax appeals annually for nearly two decades.</p><p>Erik Wind, Founder and CEO of Tax Appeal Plus, explained the industry challenge from personal experience. Having done the work myself from the ground up, I know how bogged down the best firms are by chasing signatures, piecing together documents, and doing what I call arts and crafts, Wind said. I knew there was a better way to help high-volume firms simplify and scale.</p><p>For decades, high-volume property tax appeal firms have faced an uphill battle of time-consuming administrative work. Many are drowning in spreadsheets or piecing together ad-hoc systems that dont integrate with tax assessor data or synchronize data across platforms. Tax Appeal Plus directly addresses these pain points with an all-in-one, cloud-based platform to manage the entire appeals process, streamlining the end-to-end lifecycle from intake to invoicing.</p><p>The platform has already demonstrated significant impact in the industry. Adam Heller, President of Heller & Consultants Tax Grievance, reported that Tax Appeal Plus completely changed the game for my tax grievance business. Prior to Tax Appeal Plus, we were manually drafting legal forms, invoices, and more. Now, at the push of a button, it handles my entire business and has catapulted our firm to one of the largest in New York State.</p><p>Marsha Held, President at Property Tax Adjusters, LTD, echoed this sentiment, stating that Tax Appeal Plus has allowed our company to grow at a rapid rate. Erik has an incredible grasp of our industry. His knowledge and experience are unparalleled. The software has filed over 200,000 appeals for high-volume firms, demonstrating its capacity to handle significant caseloads efficiently.</p><p>Wind brings substantial industry credibility to the venture, having spent almost three decades in property tax before launching Tax Appeal Plus. His previous company, GeoData Plus, was acquired by ATTOM Data Solutions, one of the largest property data firms in the country, in a multi-million dollar private sale in 2021. This background informs the platforms design, which was developed over nearly 20 years with deep domain expertise to meet the real-world needs of property tax professionals.</p><p>Tax Appeal Plus is available immediately for property tax firms throughout the United States through their website at <a href="https://www.taxappealplus.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.taxappealplus.com</a>. Instead of hopping between separate billing systems, document managers, and filing tools, professionals can now manage the entire property tax grievance lifecycle in one secure, cloud-based system, representing a significant advancement for an industry long hampered by administrative inefficiencies.</p>
