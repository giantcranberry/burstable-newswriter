<p>Quantum Computing Inc. (NASDAQ: QUBT) has entered into securities purchase agreements with institutional investors for the sale of 37,183,937 shares of common stock in an oversubscribed private placement priced at the market under Nasdaq rules. The offering, for expected gross proceeds of $750 million, is scheduled to close on or about Oct. 8, 2025, subject to customary conditions. Titan Partners Group, a division of American Capital Partners, acted as sole placement agent for the transaction.</p><p>The company plans to use the proceeds to accelerate commercialization, pursue strategic acquisitions, establish volume production capabilities, expand sales and engineering teams, and for working capital and general corporate purposes. This substantial funding represents a significant milestone for the integrated photonics and quantum optics technology company as it scales operations and expands market presence.</p><p>CEO and Chairman Dr. Yuping Huang emphasized that this financing increases total capital raised since November 2024 to $1.64 billion, positioning QCi with one of the strongest balance sheets in the quantum sector. This financial strength supports the company's strategic transition from a technology innovator to a leading quantum hardware manufacturer, enabling accelerated growth and market penetration.</p><p>Quantum Computing Inc. provides accessible and affordable quantum machines and foundry services for the production of photonic chips based on thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN). The company's products are designed to operate at room temperature and low power at an affordable cost, addressing key barriers to quantum computing adoption. The company's portfolio of core technologies and products offer unique capabilities in the areas of high-performance computing, artificial intelligence, and cybersecurity, as well as remote sensing applications.</p><p>The oversubscribed nature of this private placement indicates strong investor confidence in QCi's technology roadmap and commercial prospects. This funding comes at a critical time as the quantum computing industry continues to mature and move toward practical applications. The ability to raise substantial capital positions QCi to compete effectively in the rapidly evolving quantum technology landscape while advancing the commercialization of integrated photonics solutions.
