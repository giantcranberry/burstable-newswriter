<p>Phoenix-based retail brokerage specialist Western Retail Advisors has secured new location deals that will expand the popular fast casual Mexican restaurant chain Someburros to three additional Arizona communities. This expansion will grow the hometown Arizona business to 20 restaurants statewide, with new locations planned for Surprise, Peoria and Maricopa.</p><p>The latest Someburros restaurant location was announced following the company's acquisition of 1.21 acres at 42618 W. Maricopa-Casa Grande Highway, at the northwest corner of Maricopa-Casa Grande Highway and Stonegate Road in Maricopa. The new Someburros will sit within Stonegate, an emerging retail center anchored by Home Depot and Starbucks. The restaurant will total 3,519 square feet and include a main dining room, drive-thru and covered patio, and will offer both online ordering and third-party delivery.</p><p>Alberto Caballero and Dave Uhles of Western Retail Advisors represented Someburros in the Maricopa land acquisition. This marks the third new restaurant site that WRA has helped Someburros complete this year. The other locations include an outparcel pad within Sycamore Farms, a Barclay-owned retail center located at the southwest corner of Cactus and Sarival roads in Surprise, with a grand opening slated for the first quarter of 2026. Additionally, the company acquired 1.15 acres within the Shops at Lake Pleasant, a Vestar development located near the southwest corner of Yearling Road and Lake Pleasant Parkway in Peoria, establishing its second Someburros location in that city with an expected opening in summer 2026.</p><p>Tim Vasquez, owner and third-generation restaurateur of Someburros, emphasized the company's commitment to maintaining its community-focused approach while expanding. The expansion represents a significant acceleration in Someburros' growth strategy. In recent years, we've moved from opening one new location every three or so years to now opening one or two locations every year, said Vasquez. It is an exciting time for our family, and we are grateful for all those who have helped us succeed in this effort.</p><p>The company has also just signed agreements with the Arizona Cardinals and Arizona Diamondbacks for locations within both State Farm Stadium and Chase Field. Someburros opened its first restaurant location in Tempe, Arizona in 1986 and has grown to 17 locations across Arizona, all offering made-from-scratch, Sonoran-style dishes based on family recipes.</p><p>Cabellero explained that the site selection process focuses not only on the real estate but also on opportunities to truly become part of the neighborhood. Every new site is chosen with these aspirations in mind, aligning with the company's desire to help strengthen the fabric of the communities it serves. The new restaurant announcements follow the June 2025 Someburros grand opening within SimonCRE's Roosevelt Commons retail center, located at Verrado Way and Roosevelt Street in Buckeye.
