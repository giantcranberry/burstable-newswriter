<p>HeartBeam has scheduled a conference call for November 13, 2025, to discuss its third quarter results for the period ended September 30, 2025. The call, scheduled for 4:30 p.m. ET, will include updates on regulatory progress, commercial-readiness activities, and upcoming milestones for the company's innovative cardiac monitoring technology. This development represents a significant advancement in remote patient monitoring capabilities that could reshape cardiac care delivery.</p><p>The company is developing what it describes as the first-ever cable-free device capable of collecting ECG signals in three dimensions from three non-coplanar directions and synthesizing these signals into a 12-lead ECG. This platform technology is designed for portable devices that can be used wherever patients are located, potentially delivering actionable heart intelligence outside traditional medical facilities. The technology enables physicians to potentially identify cardiac health trends and acute conditions while directing patients to appropriate care without requiring hospital or clinic visits.</p><p>HeartBeam's 3D ECG technology received FDA clearance for arrhythmia assessment in December 2024, marking an important regulatory milestone. The company's 12-Lead ECG synthesis software remains under FDA review, representing a critical next step in the technology's development pathway. The company holds over 20 issued patents related to technology enablement, providing intellectual property protection for its innovative approach to cardiac monitoring. Additional details about the company's progress are available through its <a href="https://ibn.fm/BEAT" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">newsroom</a>.</p><p>The ability to monitor cardiac conditions remotely could significantly impact how cardiovascular diseases are detected and managed, potentially reducing healthcare costs and improving patient outcomes through earlier intervention and continuous monitoring capabilities. This technology addresses the growing need for accessible cardiac monitoring solutions as cardiovascular disease remains a leading cause of mortality worldwide. The development of portable, cable-free ECG technology represents an important evolution in cardiac care, potentially enabling more accessible and continuous monitoring for patients at risk of cardiovascular events.</p><p>As the company moves toward commercialization, regulatory approvals and market readiness will be critical factors in determining the technology's potential impact on cardiac care delivery and patient outcomes. The upcoming conference call will provide investors and stakeholders with important updates on the company's progress toward commercializing this potentially transformative technology. A detailed press release containing the company's third quarter financial results will be issued prior to the conference call, according to the announcement available at <a href="https://ibn.fm/5mXsb" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://ibn.fm/5mXsb</a>.</p>
