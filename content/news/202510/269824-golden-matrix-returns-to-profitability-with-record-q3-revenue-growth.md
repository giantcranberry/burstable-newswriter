<p>Golden Matrix Group Inc. reported third quarter financial results showing a substantial turnaround as the online gaming technology company returned to profitability while achieving record revenue growth. The company posted $47.3 million in revenue for the quarter ended September 30, 2025, representing a 15% increase compared to the same period last year.</p><p>The improved financial performance was driven by broad-based growth across both business-to-business and business-to-consumer divisions. Gross profit reached $26.4 million, an 18% year-over-year increase, while adjusted EBITDA grew 32% to $5.7 million. Most notably, Golden Matrix reported net income of $0.4 million, marking a dramatic improvement from the $3.3 million net loss recorded in the third quarter of 2024.</p><p>Financial discipline has been a key focus for the company, with total debt declining by $25.9 million since December 31, 2024, representing a 37% reduction. This deleveraging effort has strengthened the balance sheet, with net debt leverage standing at 1.2 times annual adjusted EBITDA. The company ended the quarter with $22 million in cash and $45.1 million in total debt.</p><p>Segment performance showed particular strength in the Meridianbet division, which saw revenue increase 26% year-over-year to $32.5 million. Online casino gross gaming revenue grew 30% to $14.6 million, while sports betting revenue advanced 25% to $13.3 million. The player base expanded significantly, with depositors increasing 25% and new registrations up 70% compared to the prior year period.</p><p>Other business units also contributed to the strong performance. RKings delivered record revenue of $7.4 million, representing 14% growth, while advancing its new customer relationship management system rollout. Classics for a Cause demonstrated strong sequential growth, with registrations increasing 72% and new VIPs up 82%. The division's August Holden Torana campaign broke company records, generating $776,000 in sales from 10,000 packages and 1,700 new customers.</p><p>Looking ahead, Golden Matrix has tightened its full-year 2025 revenue guidance to between $186 million and $187 million, representing 23-24% growth over 2024. The company expects fourth quarter revenue between $52.7 million and $53.7 million, an increase of 15-17% year-over-year.

The company noted steady momentum across key markets, particularly in Latin America, supported by product innovation and operational efficiency improvements. This performance signals a potential shift in the competitive landscape of online gaming technology, where disciplined financial management combined with strategic market expansion can drive sustainable profitability even in challenging economic conditions.</p>
