<p>D1 Training will open a new location in Rancho Santa Margarita at 29851 Aventura on October 25, expanding the fitness concept's national footprint. The facility employs a sports-science backed training regimen led by certified trainers to help people of all ages achieve their sport and fitness goals. Franchise owners Giang Ma and Merrick Miranda, longtime friends and former chemical engineers, will operate the new facility.</p><p>Both entrepreneurs began their careers in the oil and gas industry as consultants before moving into leadership roles, with Ma transitioning into pharmaceuticals and Miranda into business development and sales within the construction industry. As parents of young athletes, they were immediately drawn to D1's structured, goal-oriented training model and its focus on building character through athletics. They appreciate how D1 combines a team environment with individualized coaching, creating a space where people of all ages can train like athletes.</p><p>We see D1 as a place where hard work meets purpose, said Miranda. It's not just about physical trainingâ€”it's about helping people push past limits, stay accountable, and become the best version of themselves. That's what makes this so meaningful to us. The pair join a roster of impressive existing franchisees, including professional athletes like Kylie Fitts and Jordan Gay. Additional D1 partners include NBA star Chris Paul and Heisman Trophy winner Tim Tebow.</p><p>D1 Training offers four age-based programs including Rookie (ages 7-11), Developmental (ages 12-14), Prep (ages 15-18) and D1 Adult. Each fitness program is based on the five athletic-based tenets: dynamic warm-up, performance, strength program, core and conditioning, and cool down. Outside of group workouts, D1 Training offers group, semi-private, and one-on-one training with world-class coaches. The goal is to continue training athletes who are dedicated to their sport or fitness goals, regardless of age or athletic background.</p><p>Giang and Merrick are the ideal candidates to bring the D1 Training experience to Rancho Santa Margarita, said the brand's Chief Operating Officer, Dan Murphy. We're thrilled to welcome them to the D1 family and are confident in their ability to show the Rancho Santa Margarita area what they've been missing out on.

The brand is currently seeking financially qualified business builders, former athletes, and entrepreneurs who share a passion for fitness and youth sports and are ready to make a positive impact on their community. Founded in 2001 by former NFL player Will Bartholomew and based in Nashville, D1 Training is positively impacting the lives of 30,000 athletes of all ages nationwide.</p>
