<p>Seedium, a global software engineering company, is sharing its proven framework for building and scaling software products in response to the growing impact of artificial intelligence on the software industry. The framework addresses both the opportunities and risks presented by the proliferation of no-code and low-code AI solutions that enable accelerated development but often produce poorly structured software if foundational architecture considerations are neglected.</p><p>Mykhailo Kopyl, CEO of Seedium, emphasized the dual nature of AI tools for startup founders. "AI brings startups unique opportunities to create as many prototypes as possible even without having technical skills," Kopyl stated. "Many of such vibe-coded products successfully find product-market fit. But another side of these products is that they are not scalable enough." This scalability challenge becomes critical when successful prototypes need to evolve into enterprise-ready solutions capable of handling increased user loads and global expansion.</p><p>Seedium's approach combines intelligent automation of repetitive tasks through custom templates and setups with experienced software engineers overseeing the process, making final decisions, and validating the quality of AI-generated outcomes. This human-AI collaboration model serves as a key driver for accelerating success in software development, shortening development cycles, accelerating time-to-market, and ultimately delivering higher return on investment for startups and small to medium businesses.</p><p>The effectiveness of this framework was demonstrated in a recent case where Seedium rebuilt the back end of a large platform with legacy code within three months. "Before AI, building something similar would probably have taken a year," Kopyl noted, highlighting the significant time savings achievable through proper implementation of AI tools within a structured engineering framework.</p><p>Seedium's methodology helps businesses build quickly while maintaining readiness for growth and global expansion by combining the latest technologies with years of engineering expertise. The company has established itself as a trusted development partner since 2017, having delivered more than 200 successful products across various industries including SaaS, HRTech, and HealthTech.
