<p>Datavault AI Inc. has launched two new data unions focused on the insurance and accounting industries, representing a significant advancement in how professional services sectors can commercialize their data assets. The Insurance Data Union was established in partnership with the Independent Insurance Agents & Brokers of America and independent agents nationwide, while the Accounting Data Union is collaborating with leading accounting firms across all 50 states.</p><p>These initiatives utilize Datavault AI's patented technologies and Information Data Exchange to tokenize anonymized insurance and accounting data, enabling secure and scalable monetization of high-value industry information. Tim Varone, a longtime advisor to Datavault AI, emphasized the significance of these markets, stating that few industries possess the data assets found in insurance and accounting sectors. The data unions represent a fundamental shift in how industry data can be commercialized, leveraging smart contracts and high-performance computing to create new possibilities for data valuation and exchange.</p><p>Participants in both unions will receive compensation for qualified assets that are scored through Datavault AI's patented DataScore, DataValue, and Data Vault Bank systems. The technology infrastructure supporting these data unions includes Datavault AI's comprehensive cloud-based platform, which provides solutions across multiple industries including sports & entertainment, biotech, education, fintech, real estate, healthcare, and energy. The company's Information Data Exchange enables Digital Twins and licensing of name, image, and likeness by securely attaching physical real-world objects to immutable metadata objects.</p><p>This development marks a significant advancement in the Web 3.0 environment, where data valuation and secure monetization are becoming increasingly critical for businesses across sectors.
