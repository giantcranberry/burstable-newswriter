<p>Urtopia, the carbon fiber eBike brand known for its advanced material technology, will introduce four new models during this year's Black Friday season, expanding its lineup to 11 total models designed to serve a wider range of riders. The expansion represents a significant step in making premium carbon fiber eBikes more accessible to everyday cyclists while maintaining the brand's signature design and performance standards.</p><p>The Carbon Classic and Carbon Classic ST models will debut on November 1st, both featuring the signature design DNA of Urtopia's best-selling Carbon 1 Pro and Carbon 1 ST models. Designed by former BMW designer Mathis Heller, these new models weigh just 38 pounds thanks to their racing-grade Toray carbon fiber frames. The new Carbon Classic series introduces several key upgrades based on customer and market feedback, including a throttle option for more flexible riding experiences and a user-friendly color display with simplified start interface.</p><p>Perhaps most significantly, the Carbon Classic models achieve a more accessible price point of $1,999 by removing the AI-powered Smart Box feature. This strategic pricing adjustment makes the Carbon Classic series Urtopia's most approachable carbon eBike lineup yet, offering lightweight, beautifully designed bikes ideal for everyday riders. Later in November, Urtopia will launch two additional models: the Joy Ultra and Fold ST. Both build on the success of the popular Joy Carbon eBike, offering lighter weight and enhanced performance while maintaining the brand's modern, minimalist design aesthetic.</p><p>The Fold ST, a step-through folding eBike, follows the success of the Carbon Fold 1, which received widespread praise for its portability and design. This expansion comes during a period of rapid growth for Urtopia, which introduced seven new models in 2025 and expanded its dealer network to over 750 locations worldwide. The company's growing product portfolio reinforces its position as one of the fastest-growing innovators in the premium eBike market. Urtopia now maintains a thriving community of over 200,000 members and more than 750 partner shops across the United States.</p><p>With its expanded product lineup, Urtopia continues its mission to deliver cutting-edge design, advanced carbon fiber craftsmanship, and smarter mobility solutions for riders around the world. The new models represent the brand's commitment to making high-performance carbon fiber eBikes more accessible while maintaining the quality and innovation that has defined the company's approach to sustainable transportation.
