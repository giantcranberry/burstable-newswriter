<p>Strawberry Fields REIT Inc. (NYSE AMERICAN: STRW) is aggressively expanding its portfolio to position itself for substantial growth in the elderly care sector, which is projected to increase from $49.29 billion in 2024 to $98.19 billion by 2032. The self-administered real estate investment trust currently maintains long-term leasehold interests in 142 healthcare facilities with over 15,500 licensed beds, establishing a significant foothold in the skilled nursing and healthcare services market.</p><p>The company's expansion strategy aligns with the elderly care market's expected compound annual growth rate of 9% between 2025 and 2032. This growth trajectory represents a substantial opportunity for real estate investment trusts specializing in healthcare properties. Strawberry Fields REIT's business model focuses exclusively on property ownership and leasing, while third-party operators manage day-to-day healthcare services at its facilities, creating a specialized approach to capitalizing on healthcare real estate demands.</p><p>The primary driver behind this market expansion is the aging baby boomer population in the United States. According to U.S. Census Bureau data, there were approximately 76.4 million baby boomers in the country as of 2020. The demographic shift is accelerating significantly, with every baby boomer expected to reach age 65 or older by 2030, creating unprecedented demand for skilled nursing and healthcare facilities across the nation.</p><p>Strawberry Fields REIT recognizes the substantial untapped opportunity in this sector and is actively working to increase its market presence. The company's specialized business model enables it to benefit from growing demand for elderly care services without directly operating healthcare facilities. This approach provides stable, long-term lease income while transferring operational responsibilities to experienced healthcare providers, creating a balanced risk profile for investors.</p><p>The projected market growth to $98.19 billion by 2032 underscores the strategic importance of Strawberry Fields REIT's expansion efforts.
