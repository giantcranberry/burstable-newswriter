<p>Inter, a financial super app serving over 40 million customers globally, is redefining financial services by integrating banking, payments, rewards, shopping, and social networking into one seamless platform. According to Ray Chalub, Chief Operating Officer at Inter, the company's approach focuses on experiences rather than just transactions, connecting financial moments across borders, cultures, and lifestyles in a single accessible experience.</p><p>The company's expansion strategy leverages its Brazilian roots to build a borderless financial ecosystem that addresses fragmentation in traditional financial services. Chalub emphasized that operating in complex markets has provided Inter with the skills to scale, adapt, and earn consumer trust, which now fuels their global expansion. The U.S. market represents a key validation point for Inter's approach, with the company addressing gaps in cross-border payment strategies that many large corporations still lack.</p><p>Inter's innovation in payments centers on three core principles: localization that scales to adapt to local behaviors and needs, simplicity and speed that make payments as easy as sending a text, and maintaining trust through safe, compliant, and accessible solutions. The company is making payments instant, affordable, and seamless whether money moves across the street or across the world.</p><p>A significant component of Inter's growth strategy is Forum, the company's creator-driven social platform available exclusively through the Inter App. Forum has already surpassed 15 million registered users and is becoming one of Inter's strongest organic growth engines. The platform combines content, community, and commerce in one place where users can bank, shop, learn, and be inspired.</p><p>Inter is redirecting up to $10 million over the next few years to reward creators who bring their communities to Forum through its Loop Points system. Creators earn rewards based on engagement, which are redeemable for cash, products, or perks across Inter. This creates a growth cycle where creators, their communities, and Inter all benefit simultaneously.</p><p>Creators play a crucial role in Inter's U.S. expansion strategy because they connect with people in real time, shape culture, build trust, and localize stories in ways traditional media cannot. In diverse and multicultural markets, creators help translate Inter's products like the Inter Passport Credit Card or cross-border tools into everyday relevance for consumers.</p><p>Looking toward 2025 and beyond, Inter aims to build the most useful app in users' lives, evolving beyond traditional banking into a hub for living, transacting, discovering, and growing. The company plans to continue expanding U.S. offerings, simplifying cross-border financial experiences, and scaling Forum into one of the most vibrant creator ecosystems across the Americas.
