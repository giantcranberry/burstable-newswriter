<p>The partnership between Corsha and Dragos represents a significant advancement in operational technology security by integrating automated machine identity protection with industrial threat detection capabilities. As operational networks become increasingly complex and connected, the collaboration addresses fundamental security gaps in machine-to-machine communication that have traditionally been vulnerable to exploitation.</p><p>Operational technology environments face escalating security challenges as new machines, sensors, and autonomous systems expand the attack surface, often communicating without proper authentication or accountability. Adversaries increasingly exploit these unverified machine connections to move laterally through networks and evade detection. The Corsha and Dragos integration directly confronts these vulnerabilities by combining continuous machine identity verification with comprehensive threat monitoring.</p><p>Anusha Iyer, CEO and Founder of Corsha, emphasized the critical nature of this integration, stating that machine-to-machine communication forms the backbone of modern operational systems while remaining one of the least protected layers of OT environments. The partnership enables organizations to continuously verify every connection and act on identity-driven intelligence in real time, bringing Zero Trust principles to operational technology.</p><p>The integrated solution provides multiple security benefits, including prevention of unauthorized machine communications through identity-driven microsegmentation. Dragos provides deep visibility to detect anomalies and threats across ICS/OT networks, while Corsha ensures only verified machines can initiate or maintain connections. This combined approach reduces risks associated with lateral movement, ransomware, and supply chain compromise.</p><p>The joint solution strengthens Zero Trust implementation in OT environments by combining Dragos' real-time asset visibility and threat detection with Corsha's dynamic machine identity with policy-based microsegmentation and access controls. This moves organizations beyond mere detection to active enforcement of trusted communications, particularly for non-human connections that dominate industrial environments.</p><p>Incident response efficiency improves significantly through automated enforcement capabilities. By adding machine identity context to Dragos high-fidelity detections, Corsha enhances intelligence around trusted communications, streamlining triage and response processes. Security teams gain clearer, more actionable insights that accelerate investigation and response across OT environments.</p><p>The integration also advances compliance with industry security standards, specifically supporting the Defensible Architecture guidelines within the SANS Five ICS Critical Controls. By continuously verifying and authenticating machine-to-machine communications, the joint solution enforces strict boundaries across industrial networks and builds layered defenses that are resilient, auditable, and aligned with industry best practices.</p><p>Dan Dorchinsky, VP Public Sector at Dragos Inc., highlighted how the integration provides customers with both deep visibility into threats and confidence in every machine connection, enabling faster and more confident decision-making. The combination of Corsha's machine identity platform with Dragos's industrial monitoring, asset discovery, risk-based vulnerability management, and threat detection capabilities helps organizations strengthen their defenses and operational resilience.
