<p>Datavault AI Inc. has entered a strategic partnership with Max International AG to launch and manage a Switzerland-based Swiss Digital RWA Exchange. The collaboration leverages Switzerland's advanced digital regulatory environment, home to SIX Digital Exchange, NASDAQ's technological ally, to drive institutional adoption of Real World Assets by addressing regulatory, scalability, and fiduciary challenges.</p><p>The exchange will serve as the foundation for Datavault AI's International Elements and NIL Exchanges, enabling tokenization of commodities and rights, supported by the company's global patent portfolio for secure data tokenization and automated compliance. This partnership represents a significant step forward in the institutional adoption of digital asset technology, particularly for real world assets that have traditionally faced barriers in digital markets.</p><p>Datavault AI's technology platform provides comprehensive solutions with a collaborative focus in its Acoustic Science and Data Science Divisions. The company's cloud-based platform serves multiple industries, including HPC software licensing for sports & entertainment, events & venues, biotech, education, fintech, real estate, healthcare, energy and more. The Information Data Exchange enables Digital Twins and licensing of name, image, and likeness by securely attaching physical real-world objects to immutable metadata objects.</p><p>The Swiss Digital RWA Exchange initiative builds on Switzerland's reputation as a hub for digital finance innovation. The country's regulatory framework has been particularly welcoming to blockchain and digital asset technologies, making it an ideal location for institutional-grade digital asset exchanges. This strategic positioning could accelerate mainstream adoption of tokenized real world assets across global financial markets.</p><p>For more information about Datavault AI, visit <a href="https://www.datavaultsite.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.datavaultsite.com</a>.
