<p>REPLOID Group AG shareholders have approved all agenda items during the extraordinary general meeting held on October 6, 2025, resulting in unanimous support for several key governance changes that will shape the company's leadership structure and compensation policies. The approved resolutions included formal acknowledgement of the resignation of Supervisory Board member MMag. Mario Ahrer, LL.M., marking a significant change in the company's oversight leadership. This departure creates an opportunity for fresh perspectives while maintaining the company's governance integrity.</p><p>Shareholders voted to increase the number of Supervisory Board members from six to eight, expanding the governance body to accommodate broader expertise and perspectives in the company's strategic direction. This expansion represents a strategic move to enhance oversight capabilities as the company navigates complex business challenges in the Austrian market and beyond. The board enlargement allows for more diverse skill sets and industry knowledge to guide REPLOID Group AG's future initiatives and market positioning.</p><p>Three new Supervisory Board members were elected during the meeting, with their terms extending until the Annual General Meeting that decides on the discharge for the 2029 financial year. This long-term appointment structure provides stability and continuity in the company's governance framework while allowing for fresh perspectives on the expanded board. The extended tenure ensures that new members can develop deep understanding of the company's operations and strategic objectives.</p><p>Shareholders also approved the determination of remuneration for Supervisory Board members, effective from the fourth quarter of 2025 and continuing through the 2026 financial year. The compensation structure reflects the company's commitment to attracting and retaining qualified oversight leadership while maintaining alignment with shareholder interests. This balanced approach to compensation helps ensure that board members are adequately incentivized while remaining focused on long-term value creation.</p><p>All proposed resolutions received the required majority support from shareholders, demonstrating strong alignment between management proposals and investor expectations. The complete documentation related to these resolutions remains available for inspection at the company's registered office, providing transparency regarding the governance changes. The company maintains its corporate presence at Maria-Theresia-Stra√üe 53/2 OG in Wels, Austria, with additional information available through their official website at <a href="https://reploid.eu/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://reploid.eu/</a>.</p><p>The approved changes represent a significant evolution in REPLOID Group AG's corporate governance structure, potentially enhancing oversight capabilities and strategic guidance as the company navigates future business challenges and opportunities. For business leaders and investors, these governance improvements signal the company's commitment to robust oversight mechanisms and strategic planning. The board expansion and new member elections provide increased capacity for monitoring management decisions and ensuring alignment with shareholder interests, which could translate to more stable long-term performance and reduced governance risks in competitive markets.</p>
