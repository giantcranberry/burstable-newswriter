<p>Foremost Clean Energy Ltd. has secured a three-year exploration permit from the Saskatchewan Ministry of Environment for its Hatchet Lake Uranium Project in the Athabasca Basin region. The permit authorizes up to 50 drill holes through December 2028, providing significant operational flexibility for the company's exploration activities in one of the world's most prospective uranium districts.</p><p>The company has planned a 3,000-metre Phase 2 drill program for winter 2025â€“2026 that will follow up on the Tuning Fork discovery and test additional high-priority targets advanced through historic work by Denison Mines. This systematic approach builds upon previous exploration efforts and represents a strategic advancement in the project's development timeline.</p><p>CEO Jason Barnard emphasized the broader significance of this development, highlighting uranium's critical role in meeting growing global clean energy demand as nations worldwide transition toward carbon-free energy sources. The timing of this permit approval coincides with increasing recognition of uranium's importance in the global energy transition. As demand for carbon-free energy continues to accelerate, domestically mined uranium is positioned for dynamic growth, playing an important role in the future of clean energy infrastructure.</p><p>Foremost Clean Energy holds an option to earn up to a 51% interest in the Hatchet Lake property, which is part of the company's broader portfolio of 10 prospective uranium properties spanning over 330,000 acres in the Athabasca Basin region. The Athabasca Basin region of northern Saskatchewan remains one of the world's premier uranium districts, hosting some of the highest-grade uranium deposits globally. The company's mission focuses on making significant discoveries alongside and in collaboration with Denison through systematic and disciplined exploration programs. Additional information about the company's developments can be found at <a href="https://ibn.fm/FMST" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://ibn.fm/FMST</a>.</p><p>Beyond its uranium portfolio, Foremost Clean Energy maintains lithium projects across 55,000+ acres in Manitoba and Quebec, positioning the company across multiple critical minerals essential for clean energy technologies. The company's diversified approach reflects the comprehensive nature of the energy transition, where both nuclear power through uranium and battery storage through lithium represent complementary components of a low-carbon future. This strategic positioning across multiple critical minerals provides investors with exposure to complementary clean energy technologies while mitigating single-commodity risk.</p><p>The exploration permit approval represents a significant milestone in advancing North American uranium resources at a time when global energy security concerns and decarbonization goals are driving renewed interest in nuclear power. With countries worldwide accelerating their transition away from fossil fuels, reliable domestic sources of uranium become increasingly vital for energy independence and meeting climate targets. The company's systematic exploration approach in a proven uranium district positions it to potentially contribute to North America's critical mineral supply chain while supporting the broader clean energy transition.</p>
