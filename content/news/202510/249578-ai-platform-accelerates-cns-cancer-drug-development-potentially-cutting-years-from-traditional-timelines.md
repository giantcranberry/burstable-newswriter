<p>Artificial intelligence is positioned to dramatically reshape how central nervous system cancer drugs are developed, potentially reducing the traditional decade-long timelines and hundreds of millions in costs associated with bringing new treatments to patients. Lantern Pharma Inc. CEO Panna Sharma and new board member Dr. Lee Schalop recently discussed how the company's RADR AI platform is helping identify optimal indications and pathways for precision cancer therapies.</p><p>The conversation highlighted lessons from Dr. Schalop's experience developing ONC201, which was approved for H3K27M-mutant glioma after a 16-year journey. Both leaders emphasized the potential for AI to accelerate regulatory reviews and clinical trial design, ultimately improving patient access to new treatments. This approach could significantly impact how quickly innovative therapies reach those battling CNS cancers.</p><p>Lantern Pharma, a clinical-stage biotechnology company leveraging artificial intelligence and machine learning, aims to challenge the conventional oncology drug development timeline through its technology platform. The discussion titled "From Discovery to Clinical Trials to Patients: Key Decisions Shaping Novel CNS Oncology Medicines" explored how data-driven insights can optimize drug development strategies.</p><p>The company's new CNS cancer drug candidate, STAR-001, stands to benefit from these AI-driven insights. By using advanced computational methods to analyze biological data, the RADR platform can identify the most promising therapeutic targets and patient populations, potentially reducing both the time and financial resources required to bring new treatments to market. Additional information about the company's progress is available at https://ibn.fm/LTRN.</p><p>This AI-driven approach represents a significant shift in how pharmaceutical companies approach drug development, particularly in the challenging field of central nervous system oncology. The technology's ability to process vast amounts of biological data and identify patterns invisible to traditional research methods could lead to more efficient clinical trials and better outcomes for patients facing these difficult-to-treat cancers.</p><p>The application of artificial intelligence in drug development continues to gain momentum across the pharmaceutical industry, with companies like Lantern Pharma demonstrating how these technologies can address longstanding challenges in bringing new treatments to patients more efficiently. For CNS cancer patients who have historically faced limited treatment options and long development cycles, this technological advancement could mean faster access to potentially life-saving therapies.</p>
