<p>The DuPont de Nemours board has approved the separation of its electronics segment into Qnity Electronics, creating a new publicly traded company that completes the materials giant's multiyear portfolio streamlining effort. This strategic move represents the final step in DuPont's transformation toward focusing on specialty industrial businesses while establishing Qnity as an independent entity targeting high-growth technology markets.</p><p>Under the approved plan, DuPont will distribute all outstanding Qnity common stock to shareholders through a pro rata dividend, with the transaction scheduled to close on November 1. Investors of record as of October 22 will receive one share of Qnity stock for every two DuPont shares they own, with fractional shares settled in cash. The separation includes a $4.12 billion cash dividend payment to DuPont from Qnity, along with additional financial arrangements totaling approximately $66 million in pre-funded interest deposits and escrow returns.</p><p>Qnity common stock will begin trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol "Q," with when-issued trading commencing October 27 under the temporary symbol "Q WI" through October 31. Regular trading is scheduled to start November 3. During this transitional period, DuPont shares will trade in two separate markets: regular-way trading under the DD symbol, which includes rights to receive Qnity shares, and ex-distribution trading under DD WI, which excludes these rights. The company emphasized that investors selling DuPont stock in the regular market before the distribution date will forfeit their entitlement to Qnity shares.</p><p>This spin-off completes DuPont's strategic pivot toward its core industrial and specialty materials portfolio, which encompasses water solutions, safety protection, and advanced polymers segments. Meanwhile, Qnity emerges as a standalone electronics-focused company positioned to capitalize on the rapidly expanding semiconductor, display, and advanced materials markets. The separation represents the culmination of DuPont's broader restructuring initiative that began following its 2017 merger and subsequent breakup with Dow and Corteva, part of a multiyear effort to enhance operational focus and unlock shareholder value.</p><p>Qnity inherits DuPont's established electronics technologies, including critical materials used in semiconductor fabrication and flexible display manufacturing. These sectors are expected to experience significant growth driven by increasing global demand for artificial intelligence systems, electric vehicles, and advanced computing infrastructure. The spin-off enables both companies to pursue more focused growth strategies, with DuPont concentrating on industrial applications while Qnity targets opportunities in the global technology supply chain. The transaction requires no action from shareholders to receive Qnity stock, though investors are advised to consult financial and tax professionals regarding potential implications of the separation.</p>
