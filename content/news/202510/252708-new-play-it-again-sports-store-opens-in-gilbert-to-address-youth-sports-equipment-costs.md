<p>The recent opening of Play It Again Sports in Gilbert at 3143 E Williams Field, STE 101 provides East Valley families with access to affordable used sports and fitness equipment, addressing the significant financial challenges many households face when outfitting multiple children for athletic activities. The store offers a comprehensive selection including football equipment, baseball gloves and bats, hockey gear, golf clubs, soccer gear, lacrosse equipment, treadmills, and weights, creating a one-stop destination for families seeking quality gear without premium pricing.</p><p>Owned by husband-and-wife team Dean and Katie Sanchez, the business model resonated with them as parents of five children actively involved in sports. Dean serves as a captain in the Golder Ranch Fire District while Katie teaches at ASU Prep, giving them firsthand experience with the financial pressures of youth sports participation. We know how challenging it can be to keep up with sports equipment, especially when each child plays multiple sports, said Katie Sanchez. It can get financially overwhelming, and our goal is to create a community hub where families know they can find quality gear without breaking the bank.</p><p>The store operates differently from traditional consignment models by purchasing equipment directly from customers without requiring appointments and providing immediate payment. This streamlined approach enhances convenience for sellers while supporting the company's sustainability mission by keeping sports equipment out of landfills. The store accepts both new and quality used equipment, creating a circular economy where community members can sell items they no longer need while providing affordable options for other families.</p><p>The Gilbert location is part of the larger Play It Again Sports network, which includes over 300 franchised stores across the United States and Canada along with an e-commerce shop available at https://playitagainsports.com. The brand is franchised by Winmark â€“ the Resale Company, which operates several other resale concepts including Plato's Closet, Once Upon A Child, Style Encore, and Music Go Round. Winmark currently oversees 1,371 franchises in operation with 77 additional franchises awarded but not yet open, demonstrating the growing consumer demand for resale retail options across multiple sectors.</p><p>For business and technology leaders, this expansion reflects broader trends in the retail industry toward circular economy models and sustainable consumption. The resale market's growth, evidenced by Winmark's expanding franchise portfolio, indicates shifting consumer preferences toward value-driven purchasing and environmental consciousness. Local residents can find additional store information at https://playitagainsports.com/locations/gilbert-az/. The opening represents both an entrepreneurial opportunity for the Sanchez family and a practical solution for Gilbert families managing youth sports costs while supporting environmental sustainability through equipment reuse.</p>
