<p>Healthcare Triangle, Inc. has executed warrant exercise agreements with existing accredited and institutional investors that will generate approximately $478,000 in gross proceeds for the digital healthcare solutions company. The transaction involves the immediate exercise of outstanding warrants to purchase 239,051 shares of common stock, with the exercising holders receiving new warrants in a private placement arrangement.</p><p>The financial restructuring includes significant changes to the warrant terms that reflect the company's current market position. In connection with the exercise of the existing warrants, Healthcare Triangle agreed to reduce the exercise price from $20.92 to $2.00 per share, representing a substantial adjustment that facilitated the transaction. The new warrants issued to investors carry an exercise price of $3.00 per share and are immediately exercisable upon issuance, with a five-year expiration term from the date of issuance.</p><p>The warrant inducement transaction, which closed on October 8, 2025, provides Healthcare Triangle with immediate capital infusion while maintaining investor participation through the new warrant structure. The company specializes in digital transformation solutions for healthcare and life sciences organizations, supporting hospitals, health systems, payers, and pharmaceutical companies in improving health outcomes through better utilization of data and information technologies.</p><p>WallachBeth Capital served as financial advisor for the warrant inducement transaction, facilitating the agreement between Healthcare Triangle and its investors. The gross proceeds of approximately $478,000 represent immediate funding before accounting for financial advisor fees and other transaction expenses, with additional potential funding available through future exercises of the new warrants.</p><p>This capital raise occurs as Healthcare Triangle continues to serve the highly regulated healthcare and life sciences industries with expertise in cloud solutions, security and compliance, data lifecycle management, and healthcare interoperability. The company has achieved HITRUST Certification for its Cloud and Data Platform, marketed as <a href="https://www.healthcaretriangle.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">CloudEz and DataEz</a>, demonstrating adherence to high standards for data protection and information security in the healthcare sector. This funding positions the company to expand its digital healthcare solutions at a time when the industry faces increasing pressure to modernize infrastructure while maintaining strict compliance with healthcare regulations.</p>
