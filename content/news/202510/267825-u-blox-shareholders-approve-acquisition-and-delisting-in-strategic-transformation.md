<p>Shareholders of u-blox have unanimously approved all motions proposed by the Board of Directors during the Extraordinary General Meeting 2025, representing a crucial milestone in the company's corporate transformation and pending acquisition by private equity firm Advent International. The comprehensive approval signals strong support for the company's strategic direction and the proposed acquisition, which will fundamentally alter u-blox's operational framework and strategic flexibility in the competitive technology landscape.</p><p>The meeting resulted in significant leadership changes, with shareholders electing Claudio Simao as both member and Chairman of the Board of Directors, while Ronald Ayles and Bernhard Spetsmann were elected as additional board members. All appointments are effective until the conclusion of the next ordinary general meeting. Shareholders also approved the election of both Claudio Simao and Ronald Ayles to serve on the company's Nomination, Compensation and Sustainability Committee, establishing new governance structures for the technology firm.</p><p>These leadership changes are contingent upon the completion of the public tender offer launched by Advent International through its indirect subsidiary ZI Zenith S.a r.l. for all publicly held registered shares in u-blox. The tender offer, announced earlier this year, represents a significant shift in the company's ownership structure and strategic direction as it moves from public to private ownership. This transition could provide u-blox with greater operational flexibility and long-term strategic focus without the quarterly pressures of public markets.</p><p>In a decisive move, shareholders approved the delisting of u-blox registered shares from the SIX Swiss Exchange, subject to the successful completion of the public tender offer. The Board of Directors received authorization to implement this resolution following the completion of the acquisition process. This delisting marks the end of u-blox's public trading status and transitions the company to private ownership under Advent International's control, potentially allowing for more aggressive investment in research and development.</p><p>The company confirmed that minutes from the Extraordinary General Meeting 2025 will be made available on the official u-blox website at https://www.u-blox.com in the coming days, providing full transparency regarding the proceedings and decisions made during the meeting. u-blox maintains its position as a global technology leader serving automotive, industrial, and consumer markets with its innovative positioning and wireless communication solutions.</p><p>For the broader technology industry, this acquisition represents another example of private equity firms targeting established technology companies with strong market positions and growth potential. The move to private ownership could accelerate u-blox's innovation in positioning and short-range communication technologies, potentially strengthening its competitive position against larger players in the automotive and industrial technology sectors. The changes in board composition and planned delisting represent fundamental shifts in u-blox's corporate governance and market positioning as it prepares for its next phase of growth under private ownership.</p>
