<p>The technology markets are undergoing rapid change, driven by the convergence of artificial intelligence, machine learning, cloud computing and other technologies. Companies that fail to embrace these innovations risk falling behind, while those that adopt them face implementation challenges that align with business objectives and growth strategies. Asael Meir, Partner and Technology Industry Leader at CohnReznick, stated that technology markets are evolving at breakneck speed, and companies that fail to embrace AI, cloud and other innovations risk falling behind.</p><p>CohnReznick helps technology leaders navigate this complexity and align transformation with business growth through its accounting, risk management and digital transformation services. The company is helping tech companies optimize their business performances, manage risk and maximize value through the use of AI and other cutting-edge technology. CohnReznick professionals have decades of extensive technology industry experience, serving sectors including software, cloud, mobility and data analytics across the industry spectrum from startups to established companies.</p><p>The company provides full life cycle support from early-stage strategy to transaction readiness. In one case study, CohnReznick helped a portfolio company assess the investment thesis behind acquiring a startup to overhaul its legacy software business. Through due diligence and deep analysis, CohnReznick discovered the startup's platform lacked necessary systems to scale, requiring substantial investment to reach the buyer's offering level. This information enabled the client to negotiate an offer price that was one-fifth of the original estimated price.</p><p>While product agnostic in implementing technology for clients, CohnReznick also develops its own products and services, including the <a href="https://www.cohnreznick.com/digital-forensics-lab" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Digital Forensics Lab</a> launched last year. This lab serves as the central hub for cyber incident response solutions, enabling professionals to assess the full scope of cyber incidents, gather and secure digital evidence, and establish protections against future cyber threats. Through advanced tools, the lab works to quickly uncover the nature and extent of incidents whether data breaches, malware infections, or unauthorized access attempts.</p><p>CohnReznick's Digital Forensics Lab outside Washington, D.C. enables the company to stand with clients throughout the cyber incident process, including providing expert witness testimony if breaches result in litigation. The company helps clients comply with breach notification mandates and regulations and recover lost or compromised data. Professionals in the Digital Forensics Lab also provide security assessments to identify vulnerabilities, monitor networks for threats, and prepare companies for cyberattacks through trial runs and test plans.</p><p>As an early adopter of AI, CohnReznick leverages artificial intelligence to help clients streamline operations. Clients seek guidance on how to use AI in their businesses and what processes and procedures they need to implement. CohnReznick advises a measured approach, implementing AI only where it will improve the business. Whether helping companies stop cyberattacks or rolling out AI that boosts productivity, CohnReznick's tech-first approach is changing how consulting works for the 21st century and beyond.</p>
