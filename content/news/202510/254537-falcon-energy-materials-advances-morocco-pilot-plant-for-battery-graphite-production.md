<p>Falcon Energy Materials plc has reported significant construction progress on its pilot plant at Jorf Lasfar, Morocco, with completion and commissioning scheduled for Q4 2025. The facility represents a strategic move to establish large-scale production of coated spherical purified graphite for the global battery industry outside of China, with three potential customers already initiating qualification processes using initial samples.</p><p>The pilot plant construction is advancing under Open Steel Structure Maroc S.A.R.L, the Moroccan subsidiary of Open Building Systems of China, leveraging extensive industrial infrastructure expertise. Structural steel fabrication has been completed, with delivery to the site scheduled for late October. All major processing equipment has been installed at Hensen Graphite & Carbon Corporation in China, with shipment to Morocco expected in November 2025.</p><p>First CSPG samples have been produced for three potential customers to initiate large-scale qualification programs. The pilot plant has been fully commissioned and tested at Hensen's facility in China to ensure optimized performance before shipment. Two distinct specifications tailored to customer requirements have been produced, with 50kg sample batches currently under evaluation by major potential customers.</p><p>The strategic location within Fluoralpha S.A.'s industrial complex at Jorf Lasfar offers direct access to world-class port infrastructure, competitive operating costs, and proximity to European and North American markets. This positions Falcon to become a key player in the global battery supply chain while reducing dependence on Chinese production. For additional information about the company's progress, visit <a href="https://www.falconem.net" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.falconem.net</a>.</p><p>Matthieu Bos, CEO of Falcon, stated that the pilot plant represents a pivotal milestone not just for producing CSPG samples but for advancing toward establishing a major anode production facility outside China. The company is confident in global availability of premium graphite feedstock and is actively testing several high-quality sources to ensure scalable, reliable supply for growing operations.</p><p>The pilot plant development marks a key step toward securing long-term offtake agreements for Falcon's proposed 25,000 tonnes per annum commercial scale anode facility. The company aims to become a fully integrated supplier of battery anode materials through its mine-to-market business model, which includes developing a high-purity graphite production mine in Guinea and a CSPG conversion facility in Morocco.</p><p>With attractive operating costs, proximity to European end-markets, and strong ESG credentials, Falcon is positioned to become a reliable supplier while promoting sustainability and supply chain transparency. The strategic partnerships with Hensen and Fluoralpha extend beyond construction, representing the development of a comprehensive, resilient industrial value chain designed to lead the global battery market for decades.</p>
