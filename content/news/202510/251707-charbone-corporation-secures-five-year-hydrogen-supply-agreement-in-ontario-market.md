<p>CHARBONE Corporation has signed a five-year hydrogen supply agreement with an Ontario-based independent distributor for regular deliveries of clean Ultra High Purity hydrogen. This long-term contract provides stable and recurring demand for CHARBONE's specialized hydrogen products while establishing the company's presence in the Ontario market for the first time. The agreement represents a significant commercial milestone that positions CHARBONE for further expansion in the clean energy sector.</p><p>The agreement calls for initial deliveries to commence in November 2025, utilizing a newly commissioned Type 1 hydrogen tube trailer that has achieved full certification from Transport Canada and the Technical Standards and Safety Authority for operation in Ontario. This regulatory achievement represents a crucial operational milestone for the company's transportation subsidiary, CHARBONE Systems Inc., which completed all necessary engineering, regulatory, and safety processes within an eight-month timeframe to meet Canada's strict hydrogen handling standards.</p><p>Dave B. Gagnon, CEO of CHARBONE, emphasized the strategic importance of this development, stating that the contract demonstrates the company's ability to build a trusted, compliant, and secure hydrogen supply network. Ontario represents a rapidly growing region for clean UHP hydrogen demand, and this agreement reinforces CHARBONE's presence in Eastern Canada. The company's approach prioritizes safety and operational excellence throughout its logistics chain, ensuring reliable commercial deliveries under the new agreement.</p><p>This contract represents more than just a commercial transactionâ€”it signifies CHARBONE's successful navigation of complex regulatory requirements and its ability to establish a foothold in key North American markets. The company's achievement of full regulatory compliance within eight months underscores its operational capabilities and commitment to safety standards, which are critical factors in the hydrogen distribution industry. As CHARBONE continues to build its distributed network of green hydrogen production plants, this Ontario agreement provides a template for future market expansion and demonstrates the company's growing role in North America's transition to cleaner energy sources.
