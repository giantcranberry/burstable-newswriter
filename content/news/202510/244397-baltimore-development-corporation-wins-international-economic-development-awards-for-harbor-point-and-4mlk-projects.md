<p>The Baltimore Development Corporation has received two prestigious 2025 Excellence in Economic Development Awards from the International Economic Development Council for cities with populations exceeding 500,000. The organization earned Gold in Innovative Financing for the Harbor Point development and Silver in Real Estate Development & Reuse for the 4MLK project, highlighting Baltimore's growing prominence in transformative urban development.</p><p>Nathan Ohle, IEDC president and CEO, emphasized the significance of Baltimore's achievements, stating that the city continues to demonstrate what it means to deliver transformative projects at scale. The International Economic Development Council's annual Excellence Awards program recognizes initiatives that drive community revitalization and advance the practice of economic development, showcasing models that have lasting, transformative impact on communities worldwide.</p><p>Baltimore Mayor Brandon M. Scott expressed pride in the international recognition, noting that BDC and their partners are driving Baltimore's Renaissance forward. The mayor highlighted how these projects represent more than just good business moves, serving as sources of opportunity for all residents while transforming the waterfront and revitalizing the gateway to the city's Westside. This recognition signals Baltimore's emergence as a model for urban redevelopment strategies that balance economic growth with community benefits.</p><p>The Harbor Point project has successfully retained major employers including T. Rowe Price, Morgan Stanley, and Exelon while adding a new five-acre public waterfront park for community use. This innovative approach to mixed-use development demonstrates how cities can maintain corporate presence while enhancing public access and recreational opportunities. The project's financing model, which earned the Gold award, provides a blueprint for other municipalities seeking to fund large-scale urban redevelopment without burdening taxpayers.</p><p>Meanwhile, the 4MLK development serves as a new gateway connecting the University of Maryland BioPark, the University of Maryland, Baltimore, and the University of Maryland Medical Center, delivering much-needed life sciences expansion space along with public amenities. This strategic positioning creates a cohesive innovation district that strengthens Baltimore's position in the competitive life sciences sector while improving connectivity between major institutional anchors.</p><p>Otis Rolley, president and CEO of BDC, attributed the awards to the power of collaboration, emphasizing the team's work to build an accessible Baltimore where inclusive and sustainable economic growth becomes reality. The recognition on an international stage represents an incredible honor for creating lasting, positive change in the city. BDC shares this recognition with key partners including Beatty Development, Wexford Science & Technology, and the University of Maryland BioPark, along with their design and development teams.</p><p>The awards were presented at the IEDC 2025 Annual Conference in Detroit, Michigan.
