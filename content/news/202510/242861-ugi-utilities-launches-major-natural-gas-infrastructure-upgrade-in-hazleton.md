<p>UGI Utilities, Inc. will begin a significant natural gas main replacement project in Hazleton starting Monday, October 6, representing a substantial infrastructure investment in the community. The project forms part of the company's ongoing commitment to maintaining safe and reliable service infrastructure while providing an opportunity for properties along the construction route to convert to natural gas service.</p><p>The underground work will focus on several key streets including North James Street between West 17th Street and West 11th Street, West 15th Street between Hanover Court and North Penn Court, West 14th Street between North James Street and North Penn Court, West 13th Street between Hanover Court and North James Street, and West 12th Street between Hanover Court and North James Street. Construction activities are scheduled Monday through Friday from 7:00am to 5:00pm, with completion of the new natural gas main installation expected by the end of December.</p><p>Local residents and businesses should anticipate temporary disruptions including road closures, detours, and parking restrictions during the construction period. The project will also require some interruptions to natural gas service, necessitating UGI personnel to access properties for equipment inspection and relighting procedures. These infrastructure improvements are critical for maintaining the long-term reliability and safety of the natural gas distribution system that serves the community.</p><p>Following completion of the underground work, temporary restoration of affected areas will occur immediately, with final paving scheduled for a later date. The project aligns with UGI's broader mission to enhance service quality across its customer base. Additional information about UGI Utilities, Inc. and its services is available at <a href="https://www.ugi.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.ugi.com</a>.</p><p>The timing of this infrastructure project allows property owners along the construction route to consider converting to natural gas service, potentially benefiting from the energy efficiency and cost advantages associated with natural gas. UGI Utilities serves more than 760,000 customers throughout its service territory, making these system upgrades part of a larger strategic initiative to modernize aging infrastructure and improve service delivery standards across the region.</p>
