<p>Lee's Famous Recipe Chicken gathered more than 280 franchise owners, corporate leaders and business partners at its annual Lee's Family Reunion conference to celebrate record-breaking growth and announce ambitious expansion plans. The event highlighted a brand experiencing significant momentum across multiple performance metrics.</p><p>CEO Ryan Weaver opened the reunion by spotlighting a system that continues to surge, with 2024 system sales climbing to $235 million and 2025 tracking ahead of that milestone. The brand now boasts an average unit volume of $1.85 million and is pushing toward a $2 million goal. Lee's announced development goals to more than double the current unit count by 2030 while investing in rebranding initiatives that modernize existing restaurants.</p><p>Conference attendees saw the impact of these modernization efforts firsthand when visiting the recently remodeled St. Charles location, which has seen an 8% sales lift and 7% traffic growth since its renovation. The success of this location demonstrates how strategic investments in restaurant updates can drive measurable business improvements, providing a blueprint for franchisees considering similar upgrades.</p><p>The reunion centered on connection, inspiration, and shared purpose beyond financial metrics. Guest speakers Danny Klein, VP Editorial Director of QSR Magazine, and Scott Greenberg, author and management trainer, challenged attendees to think bigger, delivering powerful insights on leadership, industry trends, and how to thrive in a competitive business landscape.</p><p>One of the reunion's most memorable moments was the gathering of Jack Omer and Katie Bennett, grandchildren of Lee's founders. Their presence brought nearly 60 years of Lee's history to life, serving as a powerful testament to the family spirit, tradition, and vision that continue to shape the brand's future direction.</p><p>The event culminated in the Awards Dinner, where Lee's recognized outstanding operators who embody the brand's values of service, quality, and growth. Emmett and Jenny Gamache from St. Louis, Missouri received the Legacy Award for their decades of commitment to the Lee's brand and their local community. NLM Enterprises LLC earned Operator of the Year for demonstrating exceptional sales performance and operational excellence in the Detroit, Michigan market. Henry Loving of HTL Inc. received the Pacesetter Award for the unit with the highest sales across the entire system, with his Richmond, Virginia store topping more than $6 million in annual sales.</p><p>For business leaders and potential franchisees, Lee's expansion strategy represents significant opportunities in the competitive restaurant industry. The company's proven track record of modernization success, combined with its ambitious growth targets, positions it as a compelling investment opportunity.
