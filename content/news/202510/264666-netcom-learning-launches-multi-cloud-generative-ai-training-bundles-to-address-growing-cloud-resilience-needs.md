<p>NetCom Learning has announced new Multi-Cloud Generative AI Bundles that package authorized trainings from AWS, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, and AI CERTs into outcome-driven learning paths. The bundles are designed to help organizations upskill teams comprehensively from AI strategy and governance to hands-on building and day-to-day productivity, supported by NetCom Learning's multi-modal delivery and advisory services.</p><p>The training packages include three distinct bundles targeting different organizational needs. The AWS GenAI + Google Gemini Bundle provides a strategy-to-productivity path pairing foundational Gen AI training for business leaders with hands-on Gemini enablement for daily work. The Generative AI + AWS Cloud Practitioner Essentials bundle builds GenAI foundations on AWS while covering cloud core services and Cloud Practitioner exam readiness. The Multi-Cloud Fundamentals bundle offers AI Cloud Mastery plus any two hyperscaler tracks from AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud, establishing cross-cloud and AI literacy for broad teams.</p><p>Recent events, such as the October 2025 AWS outage that temporarily disrupted major websites and enterprise services, have underscored the growing need for multi-cloud resilience. Organizations are increasingly recognizing that reliance on a single cloud provider creates operational risks, particularly as AI workloads expand. NetCom Learning's Multi-Cloud Generative AI Bundles equip teams to design, deploy, and manage AI solutions seamlessly across AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud, ensuring business continuity, operational agility, and optimized workload distribution.</p><p>The training programs target four key audience segments: executives and business leaders shaping AI strategy, governance, and value realization; developers, data and AI practitioners building and deploying multi-cloud Gen AI solutions; IT, security and compliance professionals establishing controls and responsible AI practices; and knowledge workers and project management offices adopting everyday AI tools to improve productivity. Organizations can expect outcomes including strategy-to-execution alignment, multi-cloud fluency across major platforms, responsible AI and governance implementation, and measurable impact aligned to key performance indicators.</p><p>Delivery options include live virtual training to accommodate global teams and schedules, authorized instruction through leading vendor partnerships, and program management portals to streamline enrollments, track progress, and report outcomes. NetCom Learning offers free consultations and tailored Gen AI plans to align programs to each organization's specific goals. All bundles are available at discounted pricing until December 31, 2025, with flexible scheduling, global delivery, and volume pricing options.
