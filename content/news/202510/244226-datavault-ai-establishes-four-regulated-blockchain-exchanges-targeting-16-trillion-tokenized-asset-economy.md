<p>Datavault AI Inc. has incorporated four Delaware corporations to establish regulated, blockchain-based marketplaces across multiple sectors, representing a significant expansion into the emerging tokenized asset economy. The newly formed subsidiaries—International Elements Exchange Inc., International NIL Exchange Inc., Information Data Exchange Inc., and American Political Exchange Inc.—will focus on real-world assets, sports and entertainment, corporate data, and political donations respectively.</p><p>Each exchange will undergo independent regulatory review managed by Houlihan Lokey, with technology infrastructure provided by NYIAX and Nasdaq. This combination of regulatory oversight and established technology partnerships aims to create compliant marketplaces for tokenizing various asset classes. The company expects to launch its first exchanges before year-end 2025, targeting leadership in the emerging $16 trillion global tokenized asset economy.</p><p>The initiative is supported by Datavault AI's strengthened patent portfolio exceeding 70 assets and funding from Scilex's $150 million strategic investment. The company's technology foundation includes IBM-partnered AI engines and patent-backed tokenization frameworks designed to securely convert physical assets into digital tokens. Additional information about the company's developments is available at <a href="https://ibn.fm/DVLT" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://ibn.fm/DVLT</a>.</p><p>Datavault AI's cloud-based platform serves multiple industries including sports & entertainment, biotech, education, fintech, real estate, healthcare, and energy. The Information Data Exchange enables Digital Twins and licensing of name, image, and likeness by securely attaching physical real-world objects to immutable metadata objects. This approach supports responsible AI implementation with integrity while facilitating secure data monetization.</p><p>The company's technology suite offers AI and Machine Learning automation, third-party integration, detailed analytics, marketing automation, and advertising monitoring capabilities. These features position the exchanges to handle complex valuation and transaction requirements across diverse asset classes. More details about Datavault AI's comprehensive solutions can be found at <a href="https://www.datavaultsite.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.datavaultsite.com</a>.</p><p>This strategic expansion represents a significant move toward mainstream adoption of blockchain technology for traditional asset classes. By establishing regulated exchanges across multiple sectors, Datavault AI aims to create standardized frameworks for asset tokenization that could transform how value is transferred and recorded across global markets. The regulatory compliance focus addresses one of the major barriers to blockchain adoption in traditional finance, potentially accelerating institutional participation in digital asset markets.</p><p>The timing coincides with growing institutional interest in tokenization as a means to improve liquidity, reduce transaction costs, and create new investment opportunities. For business leaders, these developments signal the maturation of blockchain infrastructure capable of handling complex financial instruments and real-world assets. The multi-sector approach also demonstrates how tokenization technology can be applied beyond cryptocurrency to transform traditional business operations and asset management practices.</p>
