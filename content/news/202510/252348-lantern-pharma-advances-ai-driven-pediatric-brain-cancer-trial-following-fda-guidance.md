<p>Lantern Pharma Inc. is advancing toward a clinical trial targeting rare pediatric brain cancers using its proprietary artificial intelligence platform and drug candidates. The company is preparing for the launch of a trial targeting a rare pediatric disease, planned for Q1 2026, following an optimistic meeting with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration that provided critical guidance on trial design and regulatory pathways.</p><p>The company is developing its clinical trial to demonstrate the efficacy of its investigational therapy LP-184/STAR-001 in combatting central nervous system cancers, including Atypical Teratoid Rhabdoid Tumor. The LP-184/STAR-001 therapy is designed to work synergistically with diuretic spironolactone and other potential combination regimens in treating childhood brain cancers. Lantern's program for ATRT has received Rare Pediatric Disease Designation and Orphan Drug Designation from the FDA, and the company is preparing to submit an investigational new drug amendment.</p><p>Lantern President and CEO Panna Sharma stated that the constructive dialogue and positive feedback from their Type C meeting with the FDA reinforces their trial design and highlights the potential of their AI platform, RADR, in identifying and optimizing combination regimens like spironolactone for devastating pediatric CNS cancers. The company's proprietary AI and machine learning platform, RADR, leverages over 200 billion oncology-focused data points and a library of 200+ advanced ML algorithms to help solve real-world problems in oncology drug development.</p><p>By harnessing the power of AI and with input from world-class scientific advisors and collaborators, Lantern has accelerated the development of its growing pipeline of therapies that span multiple cancer indications, including both solid tumors and blood cancers. On average, Lantern's newly developed drug programs have been advanced from initial AI insights to first-in-human clinical trials in 2-3 years and at approximately $2.5 million per program. This represents a significant acceleration compared to traditional drug development timelines and costs, potentially transforming how pharmaceutical companies approach oncology research. The latest news and updates relating to LTRN are available in the company's newsroom at <a href="https://ibn.fm/LTRN" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://ibn.fm/LTRN</a>.</p><p>The implications of Lantern Pharma's approach extend beyond pediatric brain cancer treatment. The company's demonstrated ability to reduce drug development timelines to 2-3 years and costs to approximately $2.5 million per program could disrupt traditional pharmaceutical development models. For business leaders and investors, this represents a potential paradigm shift in biotech efficiency and scalability. The successful application of AI in identifying combination therapies like spironolactone with LP-184/STAR-001 suggests broader applications across oncology and other therapeutic areas, potentially accelerating treatment development for various rare and common diseases while significantly reducing research and development expenditures.</p>
