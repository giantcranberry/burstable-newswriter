<p>FTI Consulting, Inc. has significantly expanded its global Financial Services practice with the addition of 15 new Senior Managing Directors and Managing Directors in 2025, while appointing Stella Mendes and Jean-Werner de T'Serclaes as Global Practice Leaders. This strategic expansion comes as financial institutions confront multiple complex challenges including rapidly evolving regulations, sophisticated criminal activity, and economic uncertainty according to Ms. Mendes.</p><p>The firm's Financial Services practice now brings together more than 200 financial services professionals who partner with clients across diverse issues, from high-stakes risk, performance issues and restructuring challenges to growth and transformation opportunities. Ms. Mendes leads the Company's financial services regulatory and compliance offerings globally, while Mr. de T'Serclaes leads the business transformation offerings for financial services clients.</p><p>Recent senior appointments include Alma Angotti, Chris Allen, Michael Herde, Michael Peters and Julien Wallen, joining a team that includes highly respected bankers, restructuring and turnaround professionals, specialists in business transformation, forensic specialists, CPAs, CFAs, attorneys, economists, technology professionals, strategic communications experts, former operators, policymakers, and former bank and securities regulators.</p><p>A 2024 Economist Impact study sponsored by FTI Consulting revealed that 29% of financial services general counsel believed regulatory and compliance crisis events posed the greatest risk to their business. An equal percentage believed that technology crisis events, such as unforeseen effects from the use of AI or data failures, posed the greatest risk, followed by operational crisis events such as equipment or systems breakdowns, logistical delays or labor shortages at 28%.</p><p>From sudden disruption to planned transformation, financial services leaders around the globe trust our experts to guide them through their most complex challenges, Mendes stated. We are committed to continuing to invest in our global platform to bring end-to-end solutions that enable our clients to mitigate risk and ensure their freedom to operate.</p><p>The seismic geopolitical shifts in 2025 will continue to present opportunities for financial services leaders as they assess risks and seize innovations to stay ahead of the competition, Mr. de T'serclaes said. The multidisciplinary financial services team at FTI Consulting leverages a diverse group of industry experts to help our clients identify and maximize those growth opportunities.
