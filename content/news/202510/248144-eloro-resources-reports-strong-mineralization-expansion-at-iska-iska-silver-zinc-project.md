<p>Eloro Resources Ltd. has reported additional assay results from step-out holes DSB-88 and DSB-89 in the Silver-Zinc-Polymetallic Domain of its Santa Barbara starter pit area at the Iska Iska Project, confirming continued mineralization open to the east. The results include 1.72% Zn over 456m in hole DSB-88 and 1.27% Zn, 24.51 g/t Ag, and 0.54% Pb over 154.50m in hole DSB-89, representing among the strongest intersections to date at the property.</p><p>CEO Tom Larsen stated that the drilling is expanding and upgrading resources ahead of the Preliminary Economic Assessment, indicating significant progress toward economic evaluation of the deposit. Executive VP Dr. Osvaldo Arce noted that the Iska Iska property hosts two near-surface deposits potentially mineable from one large starter pit with a low stripping ratio, which could enhance the project's economic viability.</p><p>The Iska Iska Property can be classified as a polymetallic epithermal-porphyry complex, a significant mineral deposit type in the Potosi Department in southern Bolivia. Eloro has an option to acquire a 100% interest in this highly prospective property, which is road-accessible and royalty-free. A recent NI 43-101 technical report on Iska Iska, completed by Micon International Limited, is available on Eloro's website at <a href="https://www.EloroResources.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.EloroResources.com</a> and under its filings on SEDAR.</p><p>These latest results from the Santa Barbara area demonstrate the continued expansion potential of the mineralization system. The substantial zinc intersections, particularly the 456-meter interval in DSB-88, suggest significant continuity of mineralization that remains open for further expansion. The silver and lead values in DSB-89 add to the polymetallic nature of the deposit, potentially enhancing the economic profile of any future mining operation.</p><p>The confirmation of mineralization extending to the east provides important guidance for future drilling campaigns and resource definition. The company's progress at Iska Iska comes as it also maintains an 82% interest in the La Victoria Gold/Silver Project in Peru, located approximately 50 kilometers south of the Lagunas Norte Gold Mine and the La Arena Gold Mine.
