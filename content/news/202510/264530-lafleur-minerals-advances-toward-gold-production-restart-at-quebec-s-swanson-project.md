<p>LaFleur Minerals Inc. is advancing toward restarting gold production operations at its Swanson Gold Project located within Quebec's globally recognized Abitibi Greenstone Belt. The company's progress represents a significant step in bringing new gold production to one of Canada's most prolific mining regions, with production launch targeted for early next year.</p><p>The company is currently conducting a 7,500-meter drill program that has already yielded assay results showing multiple mineralized zones and favorable conditions for a near-surface, open-pit operation. These results include high-grade, near-surface intercepts that support the company's strategy for initial production through a de-risked bulk sample from the Swanson site. The technical information gathered from this drilling operation will guide dig operations and inform the Preliminary Economic Assessment currently underway.</p><p>LaFleur's position is significantly de-risked by its ownership of a fully permitted tailings storage facility and gold mill capable of processing over 750 metric tons per day. This infrastructure, known as the Beacon Gold Mill, is located just 60 kilometers from the Swanson Gold Deposit, providing substantial logistical advantages and cost efficiencies for the planned production restart. The proximity of existing processing infrastructure to the primary source of mineralized material represents a key competitive advantage for the company.</p><p>The company has consolidated claims around its now district-scale 18,304-hectare (45,230-acre) Swanson site, creating a substantial land package with exploration potential beyond the initial production areas. Further expansion following mineral structures across the site remains a potential option as the company advances its understanding of the property's geology. The strategic location within the Abitibi Greenstone Belt, one of the world's most productive gold regions, adds significant long-term potential to the project.</p><p>All scientific and technical information has been reviewed and approved by Louis Martin, P.Geo. (OGQ), Exploration Manager and Technical Advisor of the company, who is considered a Qualified Person for the purposes of NI 43-101. Investors can access the latest news and updates relating to LFLRF through the company's newsroom at <a href="https://ibn.fm/LFLRF" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://ibn.fm/LFLRF</a>. The company's progress toward production restart represents an important development in Quebec's mining sector, potentially bringing new gold production to a region with established mining infrastructure and expertise.</p><p>The implications of this development extend beyond LaFleur Minerals to the broader mining industry and investment community. The successful restart of gold production at Swanson could demonstrate the viability of leveraging existing infrastructure to bring dormant mining assets back into production, potentially serving as a model for similar projects across Canada's mining sector. For investors, the combination of de-risked infrastructure, favorable drilling results, and strategic positioning within a proven gold district represents a compelling investment thesis in the precious metals space.</p><p>From an industry perspective, the project's advancement highlights the ongoing potential of established mining regions like the Abitibi Greenstone Belt, where existing infrastructure and geological knowledge can significantly reduce development timelines and capital requirements. The successful implementation of LaFleur's production strategy could encourage further investment in similar brownfield projects across Canada's mining landscape, potentially unlocking additional gold production capacity in regions with established mining expertise and regulatory frameworks.</p>
