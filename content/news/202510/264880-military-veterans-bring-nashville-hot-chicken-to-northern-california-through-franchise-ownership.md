<p>The newest The Red Chickz franchise location in Woodland will be owned by husband-and-wife duo Danny and Kathy Lisath, both military veterans who met during their army service. The couple identified franchising as their pathway to business ownership and generational wealth creation after extensive research into various opportunities. When evaluating franchise concepts, they sought something exciting, high-quality, and community-driven, ultimately selecting The Red Chickz for its exceptional food quality, energetic atmosphere, and family-oriented brand values.</p><p>The Lisaths acknowledged that franchising initially felt overwhelming due to the numerous steps involved, including financing, construction, and permitting processes. However, they recognized there would never be a perfect time to begin and decided to take the leap into entrepreneurship after years of contemplation. Their military background provided crucial preparation for business ownership, having taught them discipline, teamwork, and resilienceâ€”skills they consider directly transferable to restaurant management. The Army experience prepared them to lead with structure while maintaining flexibility when circumstances change unexpectedly.</p><p>Beyond financial objectives, the couple views their business venture as an opportunity to demonstrate the values of hard work, faith, and perseverance to their children while creating meaningful community impact. They plan to generate employment opportunities, provide growth pathways for their team members, and build lasting relationships within the Woodland area. The Lisaths have already joined the Woodland Chamber of Commerce and intend to partner with local schools and sports teams as part of their community engagement strategy.</p><p>Looking toward future expansion, the couple expressed interest in opening additional locations in surrounding Sacramento-area communities such as Davis, Vacaville, or Roseville once their Woodland establishment becomes fully operational. Their expansion philosophy emphasizes building a strong foundational business before pursuing additional growth opportunities. The most rewarding aspect of their entrepreneurial journey so far has been witnessing the business come together from construction through team training and observing customers' positive reactions to their food offerings.</p><p>The Lisaths aim to create a welcoming, family-friendly environment that brings Nashville-style hot chicken flavors to Northern California while fostering community connections. They plan to host community events including Friends & Family Nights and grand opening celebrations to establish their restaurant as a local gathering place. Their approach reflects a broader trend of veterans transitioning from military service to business ownership, leveraging their leadership experience and discipline to build successful enterprises that serve both their families and their communities.</p>
