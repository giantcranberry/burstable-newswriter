<p>Vermeer, an American-Ukrainian startup specializing in vision navigation and autonomy technologies for defense applications, has closed a $10 million Series A funding round led by Draper Associates with participation from AeroX Ventures and other investors. This capital infusion will support the expansion of Vermeer's partnerships with U.S. military forces, NATO allies, and the Armed Forces of Ukraine while scaling its optical navigation technology for both defense and commercial sectors.</p><p>The company's Visual Positioning System technology offers a GPS-independent navigation solution critical for drones and other aerial vehicles operating in contested or GPS-denied environments. The VPS system employs multiple electro-optical or infrared cameras to interpret the surrounding environment by comparing live visuals against a database of landmarks and pre-existing maps, enhanced by AI processing via Nvidia chips. This approach allows drones to maintain precise location awareness even when GPS signals are jammed or spoofed, a vulnerability commonly exploited in modern conflicts.</p><p>Vermeer CEO Brian Streem emphasized the company's unique development environment, stating that operating in a war zone has forced rapid iteration and focus on combat-effective solutions. The startup has grown from 10 to 40 employees within a year while maintaining operations in both New York and Kyiv. Vermeer's technology is already deployed with over 30 customers including the U.S. Army, U.S. Air Force, Lockheed Martin, and Northrop Grumman, with active use by Ukrainian forces to maintain drone efficacy against adversarial electronic warfare.</p><p>The funding round included participation from Boscolo Intervest, High Point Ventures, Rockaway Ventures, and the U.S. Air Force Techstars accelerator program. Vermeer credits its early development phase to the U.S. Air Force's Techstars accelerator and significant non-dilutive Small Business Innovation Research funding through the <a href="https://www.afwerx.af.mil/sbir.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">AFWERX program</a>. The company's growth trajectory reflects increasing demand for resilient navigation solutions as geopolitical tensions and cyber-electronic warfare intensify worldwide.</p><p>This development represents a significant advancement in autonomous navigation technology with broad implications for defense operations and commercial drone applications. The ability to operate independently of GPS signals addresses a critical vulnerability in modern warfare and autonomous systems, potentially reshaping how military and commercial entities approach navigation in contested environments. As electronic warfare capabilities continue to evolve globally, technologies like Vermeer's VPS system become increasingly essential for maintaining operational effectiveness and strategic advantage.</p>
