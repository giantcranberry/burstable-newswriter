<p>Balfour Senior Living, a Kisco collection, in partnership with the University of Colorado Anschutz Multidisciplinary Center on Aging, has launched a research community living lab at the Balfour Louisville campus. This initiative brings together CU Anschutz's pioneering research with Balfour communities' expertise in resident care to create an interactive environment where academic studies directly engage with older adults in their living spaces.</p><p>Residents will have opportunities to participate in studies, serve in advisory roles and contribute to shaping meaningful advancements in aging and healthcare. The living lab offers a variety of studies that residents may qualify for, including research on hearing and hypertension, neurophysiology related to walking and more efficient ways for nurses and associates to support skilled nursing residents.</p><p>Dr. Cari Levy, Head in the division of Geriatrics at CU Anschutz, described the initiative as transformative. By partnering with Balfour, we are creating a collaborative space where research and real-life experiences come together to drive innovation, Levy said. The program enhances services by fostering empathy, strengthening engagement, and providing associates with tools to better support residents and their families.</p><p>Residents expressed enthusiasm for their involvement in the program. It keeps us informed about what has happening with the research, said resident Mary Stamp. It's so interesting to be part of one of the first communities doing this. Even if our generation doesn't benefit from the study now, we are contributing to research that will help improve the health of others in the future.</p><p>Jean Bedell, another resident participant, emphasized the value of resident input in the research process. We get to have input instead of just being told what has been decided, Bedell said. Here, we're seen as real people and get to share our insights. A lot of older adults struggle to find a sense of purpose, and this helps give them one.</p><p>Michael Sell, business development director at Balfour Senior Living, highlighted how the partnership aligns with the organization's mission. At Balfour, our mission has always been to provide exceptional care while fostering meaningful experiences for our residents, Sell said. The partnership with CU Anschutz allows us to take that commitment even further by bringing cutting-edge research into our communities and empowering residents to help shape the future.</p><p>The partnership between Balfour communities and CU Anschutz represents a significant advancement in how aging research is conducted, moving beyond traditional laboratory settings to incorporate the lived experiences of older adults directly into the research process. This collaborative approach not only generates more relevant findings but also provides residents with meaningful engagement opportunities that enhance their sense of purpose and community involvement.</p>
