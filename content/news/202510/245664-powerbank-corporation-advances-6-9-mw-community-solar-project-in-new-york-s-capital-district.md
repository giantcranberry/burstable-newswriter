<p>PowerBank Corporation has executed a lease agreement for its 6.9 MW DC NY-Crawford Rd ground-mount solar project located in New York's Capital District. The project is expected to qualify for incentives under NYSERDA's NY-Sun Program and will deliver clean, cost-saving power to local residents through a community solar model. This development represents a significant step in expanding renewable energy infrastructure while supporting New York's ambitious climate objectives.</p><p>The company is currently advancing interconnection and permitting steps while securing project financing for the development. PowerBank brings substantial experience to this initiative, having completed over 100 MW of solar projects and maintaining a 1 GW development pipeline. This project directly supports New York's ambitious 6 GW solar capacity goal established under the state's Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act, positioning the company as a key contributor to the state's renewable energy transition.</p><p>Community solar projects like NY-Crawford Rd enable residents who cannot install solar panels on their own properties to benefit from renewable energy through subscription models. This approach expands access to clean energy while providing financial savings to participants who receive credits on their electricity bills. The model addresses a critical barrier in renewable energy adoption by allowing renters, homeowners with unsuitable roofs, and low-income households to participate in the clean energy economy.</p><p>PowerBank's development strategy leverages its diverse portfolio across multiple North American markets, including projects with utilities, host off-takers, community solar, and virtual net metering arrangements. The company's track record positions it to effectively navigate the complex regulatory and development landscape of New York's renewable energy market.

As New York continues its transition toward a cleaner energy grid, projects like this serve as critical building blocks for achieving both environmental and economic objectives. The community solar model particularly benefits from its ability to democratize access to renewable energy while creating local economic opportunities during construction and operation phases.</p><p>Detailed information about forward-looking statements and risk factors can be found at <a href="https://ibn.fm/OJgw0" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://ibn.fm/OJgw0</a> and comprehensive terms of use are available at <a href="http://IBN.fm/Disclaimer" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://IBN.fm/Disclaimer</a>. The successful development of this project could establish a replicable model for similar community solar initiatives across New York and other states with comparable renewable energy targets.</p>
