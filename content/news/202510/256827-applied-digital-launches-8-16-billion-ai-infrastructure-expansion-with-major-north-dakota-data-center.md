<p>Applied Digital Corporation has launched a comprehensive expansion strategy that solidifies its position as a major builder of AI-ready infrastructure in the United States. The company has begun construction on Polaris Forge 2, a $3 billion, 280-megawatt data center in Harwood, North Dakota, marking its second large-scale AI facility in the state. The new campus, scheduled to commence operations in 2026, will feature advanced waterless cooling systems, renewable energy integration, and is expected to create more than 200 permanent jobs.</p><p>The company's expansion is supported by substantial financial backing, including a new $5 billion equity facility with Macquarie Asset Management. This financing arrangement is structured to support Applied Digital's high-performance computing expansion and strengthen liquidity across upcoming construction projects. The preferred-equity deal represents one of the largest such facilities in the data center industry and provides the capital necessary for the company's aggressive growth strategy.</p><p>Applied Digital's approach focuses on developing sustainable, liquid-cooled, GPU-optimized data centers specifically designed for next-generation AI workloads. The company's proprietary waterless cooling technology and rapid deployment capabilities are central to its strategy of delivering secure, scalable compute infrastructure at industry-leading speed and efficiency. These technical innovations address the growing demand for energy-efficient computing solutions in the AI sector.</p><p>The combined investments totaling approximately $8.16 billion, including the $5 billion equity facility, $160 million in strategic financing, and the $3 billion campus development, position Applied Digital as a significant player in the U.S. AI infrastructure landscape. The company's expansion comes at a critical time when demand for AI computing power continues to outpace available infrastructure capacity nationwide.</p><p>Applied Digital's focus on underserved communities through its Polaris Forge AI Factory model represents an additional dimension to its expansion strategy. The company's approach combines hyperscale expertise with economic development initiatives, creating both technological infrastructure and employment opportunities in regions that have traditionally been overlooked by major technology investments.
