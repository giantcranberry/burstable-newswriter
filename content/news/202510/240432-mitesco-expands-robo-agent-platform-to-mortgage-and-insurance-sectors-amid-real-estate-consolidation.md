<p>Mitesco, Inc. has initiated development of specialized Robo Agent applications tailored for the residential mortgage and insurance industries, responding directly to consolidation trends reshaping the real estate sector. The company identified the growing movement toward vertical integration among residential real estate agencies that now incorporate financial products like mortgage and insurance services into their offerings.</p><p>Mack Leath, Chairman and CEO, pointed to recent industry developments including the merger between Compass and Anywhere and compensation changes stemming from the NAR settlement as key drivers creating demand for improved operational efficiency across the residential real estate ecosystem. He emphasized that both mortgage and homeowners' insurance represent longer-term products with extended profit opportunities beyond immediate sales commissions, making them strategically valuable additions to real estate businesses seeking sustainable revenue streams.</p><p>The expansion will leverage client data collected through the existing real estate agent version of Robo Agent, making this information more accessible to mortgage and insurance providers. This development aligns with industry trends toward combinations like the Rocket and Redfin transaction, which Leath believes will become essential for real estate businesses to survive and grow in the current market environment.</p><p>Brian Valania, General Manager for Centcore, explained that the Robo Agent sales force automation solution enhances the value proposition of the Centcore data center compared to larger metacenter providers. He noted that Centcore's size enables rapid customization of solutions for clients operating in highly competitive sectors including residential real estate, mortgage provision, and insurance agencies, delivering significant savings for processing and backup requirements.</p><p>The company plans to release the first version of Robo Agent for Realtors in Q4 FY2025, with the Mortgage version following in Q1 FY2026. Both applications will be available exclusively through the Centcore Data Center, which operates from Melbourne, Florida and maintains eight backup sites worldwide. This expansion targets a substantial market comprising over 6,000 mortgage companies operating in the United States and more than 3 million real estate agents, including 1.5 million affiliated with the National Association of Realtors.</p><p>Leath stated these strategic moves demonstrate Mitesco's commitment to shareholders and investors, with the company maintaining focus on building a successful growth-oriented business centered on digital markets. The company will continue its acquisition strategy, targeting complementary businesses in software, data center services, and emerging tech verticals that enhance scale and support long-term margin expansion. Mitesco anticipates moving its share listing to a senior exchange, and potentially an international exchange, during FY2026, subject to growth capital availability and market acceptance of their offerings.</p>
