<p>CHARBONE Corporation has confirmed the safe arrival of all major production equipment components at its Sorel-Tracy hydrogen facility, representing a significant advancement in the company's development schedule. This equipment delivery enables the official start of civil works scheduled for October 27, 2025, initiating the first operational phase toward equipment reinstallation, connection, and commissioning planned for November 2025.</p><p>The milestone follows the strategic transaction announced on October 7, 2025, through which CHARBONE secured hydrogen production assets. This acquisition has positioned the company to substantially reduce capital expenditures while accelerating time to market through integration of proven, efficient equipment. Site team mobilization continues this week to prepare for the civil works commencement, demonstrating the company's operational momentum.</p><p>As a North American producer and distributor specializing in clean Ultra High Purity hydrogen and strategic industrial gases, CHARBONE is constructing a distributed network of green hydrogen production plants using a modular approach. The company's business model includes diversifying revenues through helium and specialty gas partnerships while maintaining focus on the transition to low-carbon energy solutions. Additional corporate information is available through the company's website at <a href="https://www.charbone.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.charbone.com</a> and regulatory filings accessible via SEDAR at <a href="https://www.sedar.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.sedar.com</a>.</p><p>The progress at Sorel-Tracy demonstrates CHARBONE's execution capability in the competitive clean hydrogen sector, where timing and cost efficiency are critical factors for market success. The company's approach of integrating existing production assets rather than building entirely new infrastructure provides strategic advantages in capital management and project timeline optimization. This methodology could set a precedent for other companies in the hydrogen industry seeking to accelerate deployment while controlling costs.</p><p>For business leaders and investors monitoring the clean energy transition, CHARBONE's progress signals the maturation of hydrogen infrastructure development in North America. The successful equipment delivery and upcoming civil works represent tangible steps toward operational hydrogen production capacity, which could influence regional energy markets and supply chain development. As hydrogen gains prominence in decarbonization strategies across industrial and transportation sectors, efficient project execution like CHARBONE's becomes increasingly valuable for meeting growing demand for clean energy solutions.</p>
