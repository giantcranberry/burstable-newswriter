<p>Trilogy Metals has secured two major federal advancements that will accelerate development of critical mineral resources in Alaska, positioning the company as a crucial contributor to America's domestic minerals strategy. The company received a $35.6 million strategic investment from the U.S. Department of War and obtained presidential approval for the Ambler Access Project, marking substantial progress toward developing the Upper Kobuk Mineral Projects in northwestern Alaska.</p><p>The Department of War investment, facilitated through the Office of the Undersecretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment, will grant the federal government a 10% interest in Trilogy Metals. This funding is specifically designated to accelerate exploration and development activities at the Upper Kobuk Mineral Projects, which contain substantial deposits of copper, zinc, lead, silver, and gold. The strategic nature of this investment underscores the national security importance of developing domestic sources for critical minerals essential to defense applications and clean energy technologies.</p><p>Simultaneously, President Donald Trump issued permits for the Ambler Access Project, a crucial 211-mile industrial-use-only road that will connect Alaska's Dalton Highway to the remote Ambler Mining District. This infrastructure development is essential for accessing the mineral-rich region and represents a significant step toward establishing a reliable domestic supply chain for minerals critical to national security and economic stability. The road project has been a longstanding priority for both industry and government stakeholders seeking to reduce dependence on foreign mineral sources.</p><p>These developments highlight Trilogy Metals' growing role in supporting America's minerals strategy while balancing environmental protection and community empowerment objectives. The company's progress aligns with broader federal initiatives to strengthen domestic critical mineral production capacity.

This advancement comes at a time when global competition for critical minerals intensifies, and nations worldwide are seeking to secure stable supplies for technological and defense applications. The Upper Kobuk Mineral Projects represent one of North America's most significant undeveloped mineral districts, with potential to substantially contribute to domestic mineral production for decades, reducing reliance on foreign sources and strengthening national security interests.</p>
