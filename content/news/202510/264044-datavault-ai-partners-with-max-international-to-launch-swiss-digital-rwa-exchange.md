Management has provided 2026 revenue guidance of $40 million to $50 million, with growth accelerated by the recent CompuSystems acquisition that is expected to contribute up to $20 million in annual revenue.

These technologies cover intellectual property related to audio timing, synchronization and multi-channel interference cancellation.</p><p>The Data Science Division leverages Web 3.0 infrastructure and high-performance computing to deliver solutions for experiential data perception, valuation and secure monetization. The company's Information Data Exchange enables Digital Twins and facilitates licensing of name, image and likeness by securely connecting physical real-world objects to immutable metadata objects. This approach supports responsible AI implementation with built-in integrity safeguards.</p><p>Datavault AI's cloud-based platform serves multiple industries through customizable solutions that include HPC software licensing for sports and entertainment, events and venues, biotech, education, fintech, real estate, healthcare and energy sectors. The technology suite offers AI and machine learning automation, third-party integration capabilities, detailed analytics, marketing automation and advertising monitoring features.
