<p>2G Energy AG has revised its sales revenue forecast for the 2025 financial year downward to EUR 380 to 400 million, representing a significant reduction from the previous projection of EUR 430 to 440 million. Despite this adjustment, the company still anticipates achieving revenue growth of up to 7% compared to the previous year. The temporary slowdown primarily stems from delays in incoming orders from Eastern Europe and a temporary decline in service volume resulting from the company's ongoing ERP system changeover in Germany.</p><p>The company now expects a reduced EBIT margin of 6.5 to 8.0%, down from the previous forecast of 8.5 to 9.5%. This margin compression is attributed to lower sales volumes and one-off expenses associated with the ERP project implementation. CEO Pablo Hofelich explained that the company had planned to manage both the ERP implementation and ambitious growth simultaneously by filling production with large-volume, low-variant orders in the fourth quarter.</p><p>Despite these challenges, the company reported strong performance in other markets. Incoming orders in the third quarter outside Ukraine exceeded the previous year's quarter by 30%, reaching EUR 57.1 million compared to EUR 44.1 million in the same period last year. The German market showed particularly robust performance, with incoming orders in Q3 2025 growing 91% above the previous year's level, driven by the newly launched biomass package subsidy program. The rest of Europe excluding Ukraine achieved year-on-year growth of 38%.</p><p>The Management Board maintains its optimistic outlook for 2026, keeping the growth forecast unchanged at sales revenues of EUR 440 to 490 million and an EBIT margin of 9.0 to 11.0%. CFO Friedrich Pehle stated that while the current year's growth of up to 7% won't be sufficient to maintain previous EBIT margins, the company remains convinced it will expand this trend in coming years through modernization of the IT landscape and associated efficiency gains.</p><p>Looking further ahead, specific projects in the newly targeted data center market in Europe and North America, along with the German biomass package, are expected to secure growth for 2027 and subsequent years. The Management Board considers the potential of Germany's biomass package particularly significant, as it provides for the construction of additional CHP units totaling 2.8 GW by 2033, increasing current installed output by 42%. The company expects to participate substantially in this capacity expansion.</p><p>The North American market continues to develop positively, with the Management Board convinced that the data center market and newly established JV rental business will more than double sales in the USA over the medium term. The company benefits from key macroeconomic energy trends in G20 countries, including increasing grid congestion, expansion of data centers with independent energy supply, growing importance of large heat pumps, and increasing demand for gas engine power generators. These trends position 2G Energy to capitalize on the global shift toward decentralized energy solutions and sustainable power generation infrastructure.</p>
