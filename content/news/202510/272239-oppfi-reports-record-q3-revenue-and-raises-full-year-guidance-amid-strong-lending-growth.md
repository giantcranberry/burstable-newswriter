<p>OppFi Inc. reported third-quarter revenue of $155.1 million, representing a 13.5% year-over-year increase and setting a new quarterly record for the financial technology platform. The company's performance exceeded analyst expectations across multiple metrics, with adjusted net income reaching $40.7 million and adjusted earnings per share of $0.46, compared to consensus estimates of $28.9 million and $0.32 respectively.</p><p>The company's net revenue margin expanded to 67.4% for the quarter, reflecting a 70 basis point improvement from the same period last year. This margin expansion was driven by operating discipline and scale benefits, according to Stonegate Capital Partners' updated coverage report available at <a href="https://www.stonegateinc.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.stonegateinc.com</a>. Net income showed substantial growth, increasing 136.9% year-over-year to $75.9 million, primarily due to lower expenses and a $32.0 million non-cash gain from lower warrant fair value.</p><p>OppFi's lending operations showed strong momentum with total net originations increasing 12.5% year-over-year to $246.1 million. The growth was driven by stronger consumer demand and credit-model upgrades that enabled larger average loans. Retained net originations grew 8% year-over-year to $215.2 million, while receivables ended the quarter at $481.0 million, representing a 16% increase from the prior year period.</p><p>The company's automation improvements were evident in the auto-approval rate, which increased to 79% from 77% in the prior-year period. These enhancements reflect ongoing improvements in risk stratification through OppFi's Model 6 platform. Credit quality showed some softening with the net charge-off rate increasing to 35.1% of total revenue, approximately 100 basis points higher than a year ago, though improved from 42% in the fourth quarter of 2024.</p><p>Based on continued strong performance, OppFi raised the low end of its full-year 2025 revenue guidance to $590–$605 million, up from the previous range of $578–$605 million. The company also increased its adjusted net income guidance to $137–$142 million from $125–$130 million and adjusted EPS guidance to $1.54–$1.60 from $1.39–$1.44. The guidance assumes approximately 89.0 million diluted shares outstanding.</p><p>Stonegate Capital Partners' valuation analysis, detailed in their research available at <a href="https://www.stonegateinc.com/research" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.stonegateinc.com/research</a>, uses a price-to-earnings multiple range of 8.5x to 9.5x, resulting in a valuation range of $14.56 to $16.28 with a midpoint of $15.42. The company ended the quarter with $75.2 million in cash and restricted cash, including $45.4 million in unrestricted cash, and maintains total funding capacity of $600.2 million, including $204.2 million in undrawn debt.</p><p>Year-to-date free cash flow generation of $66.1 million enabled continued investment in growth initiatives, a $21.7 million special dividend paid in the third quarter, and $7.4 million of share repurchases during the same period. The company also secured a new $150 million Castlelake facility that reduces financing costs by 150 basis points, further strengthening its financial position and competitive advantage in the lending market.</p>
