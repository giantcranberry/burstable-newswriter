<p>NW Legacy Law, a local estate planning firm, has become a featured sponsor for the annual Holidays on Franklin Halloween celebration in Vancouver, joining other community supporters including the <a href="https://www.todayfoundation.org" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Today Foundation</a>, Pacific Northwest Fundraising, and North Pole Adventureland. This sponsorship demonstrates the critical role local businesses play in sustaining community events that have evolved from neighborhood gatherings to internationally recognized attractions.</p><p>The Halloween event, founded by sisters Grace and Lucy Sherman, has experienced significant growth in popularity, with Franklin Street attracting over 12,000 trick-or-treaters last year. Grace Sherman noted the event's expanding reach, stating that Halloween on Franklin has gained international recognition and was featured in media outlets across the United States, as well as in Spain and Ecuador. The sisters aim to exceed last year's attendance numbers with this year's expanded festivities, highlighting how community events can achieve global visibility through consistent quality and local support.</p><p>Throughout October, the neighborhood display operates nightly from 6 pm to 9 pm, featuring elaborate lights and spooky animatronic attractions. On Thursdays, Fridays, and Saturdays, the experience is enhanced with special effects, music, and surprise guests. Popcorn and pumpkins are available for purchase during sale nights, adding to the festive atmosphere while creating additional revenue streams that support event sustainability.</p><p>The main trick-or-treating event occurs on Halloween from 5 pm to 9 pm, welcoming children of all ages while maintaining a family-friendly environment that allows leashed pets to participate. Across the street, a local church sells food and beverages to raise funds for the <a href="https://www.scouting.org" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Boy Scouts of America</a>, creating additional community engagement opportunities and demonstrating how multiple organizations can collaborate to enhance neighborhood experiences.</p><p>NW Legacy Law's location near Franklin Street on Vancouver's historic Officers Row positions it as a natural community partner for neighborhood events. The firm's sponsorship reflects a growing trend of businesses recognizing the value of supporting local traditions that build community cohesion while generating positive visibility. The continued expansion of Holidays on Franklin demonstrates how strategic local business support can fuel community traditions that gain widespread recognition, potentially serving as a model for other communities seeking to enhance local events through corporate partnerships.</p><p>As the event prepares for another potentially record-breaking year, the collaboration between local businesses and community organizers highlights the importance of corporate citizenship in building vibrant neighborhood experiences that attract both local families and international attention. This partnership model shows how businesses can achieve meaningful community impact while supporting events that strengthen local identity and create memorable experiences for residents and visitors alike.</p>
