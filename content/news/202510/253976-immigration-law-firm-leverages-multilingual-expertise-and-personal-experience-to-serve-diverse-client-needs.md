Based in Miami, Attorney Tatiane M. Silva and her team assist individuals and families in navigating complex immigration processes with both confidence and compassionate care.</p><p>The firm distinguishes itself through multilingual capabilities, with Attorney Silva and her staff fluent in English, Spanish, Portuguese, and Creole. This linguistic diversity enables culturally informed legal services tailored to meet the unique needs of each client. The practice handles a comprehensive range of immigration matters including family-based immigration, deportation defense, Special Immigrant Juvenile Status (SIJS), asylum applications, waivers, Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) cases, DACA, Temporary Protected Status (TPS), Cuban Adjustment, and citizenship/naturalization processes.</p><p>Attorney Silva's personal background significantly informs her professional approach.

This personal experience fuels her commitment to ensuring every immigrant receives a fair opportunity to build a safe and prosperous life in the United States. Her educational credentials include a Bachelor's degree in Political Science from Florida International University and graduating with honors from Florida Agricultural and Mechanical College of Law, where she ranked in the top 10 percent of her class.</p><p>The firm maintains active membership in professional organizations including the American Immigration Lawyers Association (AILA) and the Florida Immigrant Coalition (FLIC). Attorney Silva is admitted to practice in all Florida courts and before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit.
