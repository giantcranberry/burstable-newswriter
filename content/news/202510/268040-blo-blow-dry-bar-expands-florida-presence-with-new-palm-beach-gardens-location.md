<p>Blo Blow Dry Bar, North America's original blow dry bar franchise, has expanded its Florida footprint with a new location in Palm Beach Gardens, marking the fourth Palm Beach County location for franchise owners Kenny Trattner and Lyndsi Levitt. The father-daughter duo operates the new bar at 11290 Legacy Ave, Suite 140, bringing specialized blowout services to the growing Palm Beach Gardens community. This expansion signals continued growth in the specialized beauty service sector and highlights the viability of franchise models in the current economic landscape.</p><p>The new location offers five signature hair styles on its menu, Ã  la carte options, various hair treatments, five signature makeup looks, and customized styles for different occasions. Levitt, a licensed cosmetologist and Boca Raton resident, oversees front-of-house operations and guest experience, while Trattner manages business operations. Together they hold the rights to all of Palm Beach County and are committed to expanding the brand's presence throughout the area. This operational structure demonstrates how specialized roles within franchise ownership can drive business success and market penetration.</p><p>To celebrate the grand opening, the Palm Beach Gardens location is offering two limited-time promotions that reflect strategic marketing approaches in the competitive beauty industry. The Founding Membership provides a founder's rate for the signature Mane Squeeze Membership, which includes two blowouts monthly for $80 ($110 for extended time), $5 off additional blowouts, retail discounts, and other perks. Additionally, the bar is offering $45 blowouts for the entire first month of operation, significantly below the regular $59 and $74 pricing for extended time services. These promotional strategies highlight the importance of customer acquisition and retention in service-based businesses.</p><p>Levitt expressed enthusiasm about bringing Blo's services to Palm Beach Gardens, noting the community's vibrant growth and the positive reception at their other locations. The brand emphasizes creating an inclusive space where people of all ages, ethnicities, and orientations feel welcomed and represented while promoting self-care and wellness. This approach reflects broader industry trends toward inclusivity and wellness-focused services that appeal to modern consumers seeking both beauty treatments and positive experiences.</p><p>Blo Blow Dry Bar combines sophisticated design with an energetic environment to create a seamless experience for guests. Expertly trained stylists are available seven days a week for consultations, with services including signature styles ranging from sleek and straight to bouncy curls, plus updos, braids, and professional makeup services. The Palm Beach Gardens location operates Monday through Thursday from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m., Friday and Saturday from 8 a.m. to 7 p.m., and Sunday from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. For more information or to book appointments, visitors can access <a href="https://blomedry.com/blo-palm-beach-gardens/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://blomedry.com/blo-palm-beach-gardens/</a>.</p><p>Since launching the "no cuts, no color" concept in Canada in 2007, Blo has grown to over 165 locations across the U.S. and Canada, evolving to include makeup services, membership programs, and retail products. The brand's mission focuses on enhancing community lives through flawless blowouts and beauty services, maintaining its position as the world's largest blow dry bar franchise.
