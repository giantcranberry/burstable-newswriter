<p>Arrive AI has been added to the Russell 2000 and Russell 3000 Indexes, positioning the autonomous delivery technology company among the 3,000 largest publicly traded companies in the United States. This inclusion serves as validation of the company's market capitalization, financial performance and growth trajectory in the competitive logistics technology sector.</p><p>Dan O'Toole, Arrive AI Founder and CEO, stated that the addition to the Russell Indexes elevates the company's visibility within the institutional investment community and showcases its strategy to revolutionize last-mile delivery with smart mailboxes and a Mailbox-as-a-Service platform. The inclusion enhances credibility and widens participation across the investing spectrum, representing what O'Toole described as a galvanizing milestone that validates the company's ongoing efforts.</p><p>The Russell Indexes serve as widely used benchmarks for U.S. small-cap equities across diverse asset classes and investment objectives. Inclusion in these indexes opens access to a broad base of institutional investors, index funds and ETFs that track these benchmarks, supporting increased liquidity and long-term shareholder value for the company.</p><p>Arrive AI's patented Autonomous Last Mile platform enables secure, efficient delivery to and from smart, AI-powered mailboxes, whether by drone, ground robot or human courier. The platform provides real-time tracking, smart logistics alerts and advanced chain of custody controls to support shippers, delivery services and autonomous networks. By combining artificial intelligence with autonomous technology, Arrive AI aims to make the exchange of goods between people, robots and drones frictionless and convenient.</p><p>The company's system integrates with smart home devices such as doorbells, lighting and security systems to streamline the entire last-mile delivery experience. More information about the company's technology and approach can be found at <a href="https://www.arriveai.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.arriveai.com</a> and through the company's press kit available at <a href="https://www.arriveai.com/press-kit" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.arriveai.com/press-kit</a>.</p><p>This index inclusion comes as the last-mile delivery sector continues to evolve with increasing demand for autonomous solutions and smart infrastructure. The recognition through Russell Index membership provides Arrive AI with enhanced standing in the competitive logistics technology landscape and potentially broader access to capital markets as the company continues to develop its Mailbox-as-a-Service platform. This development signals growing institutional confidence in autonomous delivery technologies and their potential to transform the logistics industry.</p>
