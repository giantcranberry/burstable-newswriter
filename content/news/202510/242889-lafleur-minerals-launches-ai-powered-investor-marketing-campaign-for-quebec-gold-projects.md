<p>LaFleur Minerals Inc. has launched a comprehensive 12-month online marketing campaign with AGORACOM that leverages artificial intelligence to create engaging investor content. The initiative features AI-generated cinematic trailers, avatars, and multilingual storytelling designed to communicate with investors worldwide in their native languages. This innovative approach represents a significant shift in how mining companies engage with potential investors and stakeholders, potentially setting a new standard for investor relations in the resource sector.</p><p>The campaign includes a Verified Forum component that provides moderated shareholder dialogue, ensuring transparent communication between the company and its investors. This forum will serve as a platform for shareholders to ask questions, receive updates, and engage in meaningful discussions about the company's progress and future plans. The entire marketing initiative will be funded through AGORACOM's cashless shares-for-services program, eliminating direct cash expenditures for LaFleur Minerals while maximizing marketing impact.</p><p>LaFleur Minerals focuses on developing district-scale gold projects in the Abitibi Gold Belt near Val-d'Or, Québec. The company's primary assets include the resource-stage Swanson Gold Project and the Beacon Gold Mill, both positioned to deliver long-term value. The Swanson Gold Project spans approximately 18,304 hectares and contains multiple gold and critical metal prospects previously held by established mining companies including Monarch Mining, Abcourt Mines, and Globex Mining. Additional information about the company's developments is available at <a href="https://ibn.fm/LFLRF" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://ibn.fm/LFLRF</a>.</p><p>The company has recently consolidated a substantial land package along a major structural break that hosts the Swanson, Bartec, and Jolin gold deposits, along with several other mineral showings. This consolidation enhances the project's potential for significant gold discovery and development. The Swanson Gold Project benefits from excellent infrastructure with road accessibility that provides direct access to multiple nearby gold mills, further improving its development prospects and operational efficiency.</p><p>LaFleur's fully-permitted and refurbished Beacon Gold Mill represents another key asset, capable of processing over 750 tonnes of material per day. The company is evaluating the mill for processing mineralized material from the Swanson project as well as for potential custom milling operations serving other gold projects in the region. This dual-purpose approach could generate additional revenue streams while supporting regional mining development. The marketing campaign through AGORACOM, which operates the Rocks & Stocks communications platform at <a href="https://RocksAndStocks.news" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://RocksAndStocks.news</a>, aims to effectively communicate these strategic advantages to the investment community through advanced AI-driven content creation and global distribution.</p>
