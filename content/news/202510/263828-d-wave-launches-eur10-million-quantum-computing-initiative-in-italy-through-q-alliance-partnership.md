<p>D-Wave Quantum Inc. has launched a significant European expansion initiative in Italy through a €10 million contract for a D-Wave Advantage2 annealing quantum computer as part of the newly formed Q-Alliance partnership. The announcement, made at the Digital Innovation Forum in Como, Italy, represents a strategic move to establish Italy as a global center for quantum technology development and aligns with the Italian government's framework for advancing digital and quantum technologies.</p><p>The agreement includes acquisition of 50% capacity of an Advantage2 system for five years, with an option to purchase the full system, ensuring accessibility for Italy's scientific community, academia, and industry. This initiative marks a substantial commitment to building quantum computing infrastructure in Southern Europe and supporting Italy's growing technology ecosystem. The partnership between D-Wave, the Italian government, and the Q-Alliance aims to accelerate quantum computing adoption across multiple sectors.</p><p>Dr. Alan Baratz, CEO of D-Wave, emphasized the company's commitment as a founding member of the Q-Alliance, stating that D-Wave is dedicated to fast-tracking efforts to establish Italy as a global hub of quantum innovation. Through the placement of a D-Wave system in the region along with ongoing hands-on workshops and training for Italy's researchers and academic community, the company is providing access to commercial-grade quantum technologies and expert support to facilitate Italy's quantum-fueled progress.</p><p>Complementing the hardware deployment, D-Wave is hosting a series of seminars at Italian universities, with initial workshops held at Universita dell'Insubria and Universita della Svizzera Italiana. These educational programs are designed to accelerate quantum computing awareness and adoption among Italy's growing ecosystem of young researchers through scholarships, internships, and training programs. The seminars focus specifically on advancing annealing quantum computing knowledge and practical applications.</p><p>The Q-Alliance initiative represents a coordinated effort to build quantum computing capacity across Italy's research and academic institutions. By providing both infrastructure and educational support, the program aims to develop local expertise in quantum technologies while fostering collaboration between academic research and industrial applications. This comprehensive approach addresses both immediate access to quantum computing resources and long-term workforce development in the emerging quantum technology sector.
