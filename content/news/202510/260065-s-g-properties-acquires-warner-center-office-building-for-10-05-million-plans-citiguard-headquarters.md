<p>S&G Properties Management LLC has acquired a three-story, 62,241-square-foot office building at 5550 Topanga Canyon Boulevard in the Warner Center/Woodland Hills submarket of Los Angeles for $10.05 million. The commercial real estate transaction represents a strategic move by the buyer to establish headquarters space for its security company Citiguard while capitalizing on leasing opportunities in one of Los Angeles' most active business districts.</p><p>The buyer plans to occupy a portion of the building for Citiguard, which operates as California's premier security guard company, while leasing the remaining space to other tenants. This owner-user acquisition model allows companies to control operational costs while building equity in their real estate holdings, representing a significant segment of the commercial real estate market particularly attractive to growing businesses.</p><p>The Lee & Associates LA North/Ventura team of Darren Casamassima, Principal; Scott Romick, Principal/Managing Director; and Jay Rubin, Principal, represented the buyer in the transaction and will oversee leasing of the property moving forward. S&G Properties intends to invest significant capital into renovating both the interior and exterior of the building while creating on-site amenities designed to attract top-tier tenants to the remaining available space.</p><p>"We are seeing strong demand from owner/users in the Warner Center/Woodland Hills submarket, which continues to be an attractive option for companies seeking growth opportunities in Los Angeles," said Casamassima. The buyer was particularly attracted to the building's prominent location at the corner of Topanga Canyon and the 101 Freeway, providing visibility to tens of thousands of cars daily, along with the upside potential to create a best-in-class office property in the area.</p><p>The property's strategic positioning in the heart of Warner Center places it central to the area's main retail and business district, with abundant restaurants, hotels, and a thriving business community of local, regional, and national services firms. This acquisition reflects ongoing confidence in the Warner Center submarket's appeal to companies looking to establish or expand their presence in Los Angeles.
