<p>Gold's reputation as a hedge against inflation, weakening currencies and market volatility has gained significant relevance according to industry analysis. Global investors, from central banks to individuals, continue accumulating the metal as protection against persistent inflation, geopolitical conflict, and uncertain monetary policy trajectories. Many analysts are forecasting rising gold prices, driven by geopolitical tensions and recessionary tailwinds, with the metal already trading over US$4,200 per ounce.</p><p>J.P. Morgan Chase Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon stated on October 15th that gold could easily reach $5,000 or $10,000 in current environments. Such forecasts are drawing increased attention to advanced-stage projects in safe jurisdictions as potential future supply sources. West Vault Mining Inc. has positioned itself to capitalize on these market conditions through a distinctive strategy focused on long-term value preservation rather than immediate extraction.</p><p>The company maintains a long-term bullish outlook for gold and seeks lower risk and higher long-term returns by keeping its gold reserves in the ground. West Vault Mining has substantially derisked its Hasbrouck Gold Project located in mining-friendly Nevada through completion of a Preliminary Feasibility Study and obtaining all major permits. This approach allows the company to avoid development and financing risks until market conditions become compelling for extraction, providing a strategic advantage in volatile economic climates.</p><p>The company's value-driven strategy focuses on actions accretive to long-term value per share while minimizing shareholder exposure to development risks. Technical information about the company's projects has been reviewed and approved by Sandy McVey, P.Eng., the company's qualified person under National Instrument 43-101. Additional information about West Vault Mining's approach and current status is available through the company's online resources at <a href="https://www.WestVaultMining.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.WestVaultMining.com</a>.</p><p>Industry observers note that the combination of gold's traditional safe-haven status and current economic uncertainties creates a favorable environment for companies with advanced-stage projects in stable jurisdictions. The latest news and updates relating to West Vault Mining are available in the company's newsroom at <a href="https://ibn.fm/WVMDF" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://ibn.fm/WVMDF</a>, providing investors with access to relevant qualifications, cautionary language and forward-looking statements about the company's operations and prospects.
