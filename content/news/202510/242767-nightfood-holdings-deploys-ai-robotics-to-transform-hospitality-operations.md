The company's operating subsidiary, Techforce Robotics, currently offers four distinct robotic products: Laundry Helper, Concierge, Matradee, and Dustee, each engineered to perform essential tasks while enabling human staff to focus on more complex responsibilities requiring personal interaction and decision-making.</p><p>The AI-powered robotics platform incorporates advanced features including avoidance systems and vision technology, allowing for seamless integration into high-traffic environments such as hotels, restaurants, theme parks, airports, and shopping malls. Through its innovative Robotics-as-a-Service (RaaS) business model, Nightfood Holdings deploys these robots to handle functions ranging from trash removal and delivery to logistics operations that are fundamental to virtually every large-scale commercial operation. This approach addresses critical industry challenges including labor optimization and operational cost reduction.</p><p>Nightfood Holdings utilizes strategic real estate assets as live testing environments where robotics concepts can be validated in real-world conditions.
