<p>Cook Law Group, a Gainesville-based personal injury law firm, has expanded its Georgia operations with the opening of a new office in Macon. This strategic move extends the firm's legal services to Bibb County and surrounding areas, reinforcing its mission to provide compassionate, results-driven representation to individuals and families harmed by negligence.</p><p>Founded by attorneys Matt and Kate Cook, the firm has established a substantial track record in personal injury law, having recovered over $700 million for clients throughout its history. This includes more than $225 million secured in verdicts and settlements over the past decade alone. The new Macon location will offer the same high-caliber legal services that have earned the firm widespread recognition in the legal community.</p><p>We are thrilled to bring our commitment to justice and personalized representation to the Macon community, said Matt Cook, founding partner of Cook Law Group. The expansion enables the firm to serve more Georgians navigating the challenges of injury or loss, providing them with trusted advocacy against insurance companies and liable parties.</p><p>The Macon office will handle a comprehensive range of personal injury cases, including wrongful death claims, medical malpractice, trucking accidents, and defective product litigation. Kate Cook emphasized the firm's understanding of insurance company tactics and their commitment to standing up for those who need legal support most. Our Macon office is a commitment to standing up for those who need us most, delivering innovative solutions and maximum recovery for our clients, she stated.</p><p>Located in the heart of Macon, the new office will serve clients throughout Bibb County and nearby communities including Warner Robins, Milledgeville, and Forsyth. The firm maintains its established presence across multiple Georgia locations while expanding its reach to better serve central Georgia residents. The firm's reputation is evidenced by the fact that over 90% of its cases come through referrals from other attorneys, reflecting the legal community's respect for their expertise and track record.</p><p>Cook Law Group distinguishes itself through a client-centered approach that treats individuals as people rather than case numbers. The firm never represents insurance companies, ensuring complete loyalty to injury victims. The Macon office will continue the firm's practice of offering free consultations to help accident victims understand their rights and legal options.
