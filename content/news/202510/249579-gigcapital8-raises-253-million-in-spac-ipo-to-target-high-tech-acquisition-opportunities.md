<p>GigCapital8 Corp. has completed its initial public offering, raising $253 million through the sale of 25,300,000 units at $10.00 per unit. The offering included the full exercise of the underwriters' over-allotment option for 3,300,000 additional units, demonstrating strong investor demand for special purpose acquisition company vehicles targeting technology sectors.</p><p>The company's units began trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol GIWWU. Each unit consists of one Class A ordinary share and one right to receive one-fifth of a Class A ordinary share upon completion of an initial business combination. Led by CEO and Chairman Dr. Avi Katz, GigCapital8 operates as a Private-to-Public Equity vehicle with plans to identify and complete a business combination within 24 months.</p><p>GigCapital8's investment strategy focuses on high-technology sectors including aerospace and defense, cybersecurity, secured communications, quantum command and control systems, and artificial intelligence. This strategic focus aligns with increasing global investment in critical technology domains where private companies often seek public market capital to accelerate growth and innovation. The $253 million capital raise provides substantial resources to pursue acquisition targets in these rapidly evolving sectors.</p><p>The company employs what it describes as a Mentor-Investor methodology, aiming to partner with innovative companies possessing exceptional leadership to create industry-leading partnerships. GigCapital8 is the eighth Private-to-Public Equity vehicle of GigCapital Global, building on the group's established track record in facilitating public market transitions for technology-focused enterprises. Additional information about the company's approach and methodology is available through their corporate website at <a href="https://www.gigcapitalglobal.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.gigcapitalglobal.com/</a>.</p><p>D. Boral Capital LLC served as sole lead book-running manager for the offering, while DLA Piper LLP (US) and Ellenoff Grossman & Schole LLP provided legal counsel to the company and underwriter respectively. The successful IPO demonstrates continued investor interest in SPAC vehicles targeting innovative technology companies seeking public market access through alternative pathways.</p><p>For business leaders and technology executives, GigCapital8's successful funding round represents another significant capital pool available for mergers and acquisitions in the high-technology space. The SPAC's focus on defense technology, cybersecurity, and artificial intelligence comes at a time when global geopolitical tensions and digital transformation initiatives are driving increased investment in these strategic areas. This development provides additional liquidity and exit opportunities for private companies in these sectors while offering public market investors exposure to emerging technologies through a structured acquisition vehicle.</p>
