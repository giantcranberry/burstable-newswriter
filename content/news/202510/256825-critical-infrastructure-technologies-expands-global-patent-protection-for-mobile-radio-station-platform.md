<p>Critical Infrastructure Technologies Ltd. has advanced its international patent filings for the Mobile Radio Station technology that underpins the company's growing footprint in global defense and critical infrastructure sectors. The deployable, autonomous mobile radio station is designed for rapid establishment of secure communications in remote or high-threat environments, addressing limitations of conventional mobile LTE and radio infrastructure through integrated transportability, energy autonomy, and intelligent automation.</p><p>The patented technology substantially expands the company's Total Addressable Market beyond traditional telecommunications infrastructure into defense, disaster response, remote industrial operations, mining, and emerging aerospace and satellite applications. The system features an integrated mobile platform housed within a standard ISO shipping container containing all communications, power, HVAC, and control systems. A scissor-lift communications tower deploys hydraulically from a stowed position to approximately 16 metres, supporting payloads up to 250 kg and rated for winds up to 45 m/s.</p><p>The Nexus 20 platform delivers a fully self-contained, air-liftable communications hub capable of autonomous field operation, making it ideal for rapid network establishment in defense operations, disaster recovery, and remote mission support. A key competitive advantage lies in the super-rigid, precision-engineered mast that maintains complete stability even under extreme wind conditions, ensuring consistent, uninterrupted signal delivery critical for mission-critical defense and communications environments. The system's energy independence, automation, and structural integrity significantly reduce personnel exposure and logistics requirements, enhancing reliability and operational readiness in demanding field conditions.</p><p>The modular and AI-enabled architecture positions the technology for next-generation applications including rapid-deploy satellite ground stations and mobile telemetry for aerospace and UAS test ranges, counter-UAS and electronic perimeter defense in NATO and European defense programs, and critical infrastructure protection for ports, airports, and large-scale civic events. Global patent coverage has been filed in Australia, Canada, China, Europe, India, Japan, Republic of Korea, South Africa, Thailand, Vietnam, and the United States, with the South African patent already granted and other jurisdictions under or awaiting examination. This extensive intellectual property protection ensures broad market coverage across major defense and communications markets worldwide.
