<p>NeuroOne Medical Technologies Corporation has elevated Emily Johns to the expanded role of Chief Administrative Officer and General Counsel, reflecting the company's strategic emphasis on strengthening operational infrastructure during a period of business growth. Johns, who joined NeuroOne earlier this year as General Counsel, will continue leading legal strategy while assuming additional responsibilities for human resources, compliance, security and risk management across the organization.</p><p>Dave Rosa, President and CEO of NeuroOne, emphasized Johns' immediate impact since joining the company. In the short time that Emily has been with NeuroOne she has made impactful contributions to the organization and the future growth of the business, Rosa stated. We look forward to her future contributions as we continue to scale our business. The executive promotion comes as NeuroOne continues to advance its neurological treatment technologies while maintaining its Nasdaq listing under the symbol NMTC.</p><p>Johns brings extensive experience in public company law, having previously served as a partner at Honigman LLP where she represented numerous life sciences companies, including NeuroOne on transactional work since 2017. I am honored to step into this role and continue building on the strong foundation our exceptional team has created, Johns said. As we look ahead, I look forward to strengthening our operations and infrastructure to help bring our life-changing technologies to more people.</p><p>NeuroOne develops minimally invasive and high-definition solutions for EEG recording, stimulation and ablation for patients suffering from epilepsy, Parkinson's disease, dystonia, essential tremors, chronic pain due to failed back surgeries and other neurological disorders. The company's technologies aim to improve patient outcomes while reducing procedural costs.

The expanded role combines legal oversight with administrative functions, creating a unified approach to risk management and compliance that could accelerate the company's ability to bring neurological treatments to market. This organizational structure may serve as a model for other growth-stage medical technology companies seeking to balance innovation with operational maturity.</p><p>The timing of this executive expansion coincides with increasing regulatory scrutiny in the medical device industry and growing demand for neurological treatments worldwide. By consolidating legal, compliance, and administrative functions under a single executive with deep industry experience, NeuroOne positions itself to navigate complex regulatory landscapes while maintaining focus on technological advancement. This strategic move could enhance investor confidence in the company's ability to execute on its growth objectives while managing the inherent risks of developing cutting-edge medical technologies.</p>
