<p>Dillon Gage has announced two significant advancements at its Dallas-based refinery: the official launch of a new facility producing serialized silver investment bars and the ISO 9001:2015 certification of its quality management system. The refinery's new ISO 9001:2015 certification reflects a thorough audit of its quality management processes, including environmental controls, operational traceability and client-focused service protocols. This development carries substantial implications for investors, as bullion products produced from an ISO 9001:2015 certified scope are eligible for holding within US Individual Retirement Accounts and Canadian Registered Retirement Savings Plans.</p><p>Terry Hanlon, president of Dillon Gage, stated that the ISO 9001:2015 designation signals the company's continued pursuit of excellence. This certification confirms what clients have long experienced: precision, transparency and high-performance standards in everything the company does. In tandem with this certification, Dillon Gage has expanded its capabilities with the introduction of in-house bullion operations. The new facility is now producing a line of Dillon Gage-branded silver bars available in 10 oz, 1 kilo and 100 oz formats. Each bar carries a unique serial number and is made from traceable material aligned with ISO 9001:2015 compliance standards, with optional laser engraving available on larger bars.</p><p>Hanlon emphasized that the introduction of their own investment bar lineup brings a new level of value and consistency to the market. Clients can now source refined metal and finished product from one trusted partner, with quality and accountability built into every step. These developments represent Dillon Gage's continued investment in a vertically integrated model. Clients benefit from a seamless suite of services, including refining, trading, minting, diamond purchasing, stone removal and secure, insured storage through the company's wholly-owned <a href="https://www.internationaldepositoryservices.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">International Depository Services</a> network.</p><p>The Dallas refinery processes everything from high-karat gold to low-grade sweeps and offers some of the fastest turnaround times in the industry. All settlements are managed in-house with no middleman. Clients can track their lots and settlements in real time through the proprietary <a href="https://www.fizrefinery.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">FizRefinery</a> portal.
