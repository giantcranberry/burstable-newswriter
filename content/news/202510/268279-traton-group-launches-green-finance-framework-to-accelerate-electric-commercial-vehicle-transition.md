<p>TRATON GROUP has launched its first group-wide Green Finance Framework designed to accelerate financing and refinancing of battery-electric commercial vehicles throughout the entire value chain. The framework enables capital providers to join the transformation journey of the commercial vehicle industry, supporting the shift toward a more sustainable and electrified future. S&P Global Ratings provided an independent Second Party Opinion assessing the framework as "Dark Green," the highest possible rating available.</p><p>Christian Levin, CEO of TRATON GROUP, stated the company's commitment to driving commercial transport transformation through sustainable innovation. "With our Green Finance Framework, we align our financing strategy with global climate goals and offer investors a transparent, forward-looking platform to support the transition to battery-electric mobility," Levin explained. The framework allows capital providers to advance TRATON's investments into battery-electric mobility through various green financing instruments including Green Bonds, Loans, Schuldscheine, and Asset-Backed Securities.</p><p>The framework complies with the latest international standards and ensures proceeds are exclusively allocated to BEV-related eligible green projects. Within the "Clean Transportation" category defined by the International Capital Market Association (ICMA), TRATON established four specific sub-categories: Research & Development, Manufacturing, Financial Services, and Charging Infrastructure for battery-electric commercial vehicles. This comprehensive approach addresses the entire ecosystem necessary for successful electric commercial vehicle adoption.</p><p>A Green Finance Committee, integrated into TRATON GROUP's existing governance structure, will be responsible for evaluating, selecting, and monitoring eligible investments. The company will maintain transparency through annual reporting on the use of proceeds and their environmental impact. TRATON SE, as the parent company of brands including Scania, MAN, International, and Volkswagen Truck & Bus, positions this initiative as part of its broader ambition to create lasting sustainable impact in the commercial vehicle sector. More information about the company's sustainability initiatives can be found at <a href="https://www.traton.com/en/sustainability" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.traton.com/en/sustainability</a>.</p><p>The framework's implications extend beyond TRATON's immediate operations, potentially accelerating the entire commercial vehicle industry's transition to electric mobility. By providing a structured, transparent mechanism for green investment, TRATON addresses one of the key barriers to electric commercial vehicle adoption: financing infrastructure and development costs. The comprehensive approach covering R&D, manufacturing, financial services, and charging infrastructure recognizes that successful electrification requires coordinated investment across the entire ecosystem.</p><p>For industry leaders and investors, this framework represents a significant step toward standardizing and scaling sustainable finance in the heavy vehicle sector. The "Dark Green" rating from S&P Global Ratings provides third-party validation that could encourage broader institutional investment in electric commercial vehicle infrastructure. As regulatory pressure for decarbonization increases globally, such frameworks become increasingly important for companies seeking to align their financing strategies with climate objectives while maintaining investor confidence.</p>
