<p>Nightfood Holdings Inc. has significantly expanded its robotic live pilot programs across multiple high-traffic industries, moving beyond its initial hospitality focus into casinos, shopping malls, stadiums, convention centers, public schools, and assisted living facilities. This expansion represents a critical transition from development to large-scale deployment for the company's Robotics-as-a-Service platform.</p><p>The live pilots feature multiple categories of service robots performing essential tasks including cooking, laundry handling, and waste management. These real-world deployments are demonstrating operational efficiency and strong user acceptance across diverse environments, providing valuable data ahead of the company's planned commercial rollout in Q1 2026. The expansion validates the scalability of TechForce's robotics solutions across different industry verticals requiring automation.</p><p>Nightfood Holdings is an emerging robotics company focused on developing and deploying AI-powered automation across industries. The company's initial sector of entry has been hospitality, where its Robotics-as-a-Service platform addresses heavy-duty, repetitive, dirty, and injury-prone tasks that are increasingly difficult to staff with human labor. The company's long-term vision involves expanding into additional verticals requiring similar automation solutions.</p><p>As part of its vertically integrated business model, Nightfood is strengthening its balance sheet through ownership of asset-rich real estate, beginning with hotel acquisitions that serve dual purposes as both investment properties and live deployment sites for robotics testing and operational benchmarking. This combined strategy of robotics innovation and real estate growth positions the company to capture market share in the rapidly expanding global service robotics industry, which is projected to exceed $170 billion by 2030 globally.</p><p>The latest news and updates relating to NGTF are available in the company's newsroom at <a href="https://ibn.fm/NGTF" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://ibn.fm/NGTF</a>.
