<p>Small Business Development Group, Inc. and C2C Private Investment Company LLC have established a strategic collaboration to launch C2C Private Equity LLC, a co-investment fund specifically targeting underserved lower middle market companies. The fund, represented by Winston & Strawn LLP, will focus on businesses with revenues between $5 million and $50 million and enterprise values ranging from $1 million to $20 million.</p><p>This partnership leverages equity and public market arbitrage strategies to drive growth through acquisitions, operational enhancements, and strategic exits. The initiative supports SBDG's <a href="https://sbdg.ai/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">IPO Factory model</a>, which is designed to scale SME-level businesses and spin off portfolio holdings through IPOs and SPAC transactions on major exchanges. The collaboration represents a significant advancement in addressing the persistent funding gap that lower middle market companies frequently encounter when attempting to access traditional capital sources.</p><p>The formation of C2C Private Equity LLC arrives during a period when lower middle market companies face substantial challenges in securing growth capital. By concentrating on this underserved segment, the fund aims to identify promising businesses that can benefit from strategic guidance, operational improvements, and eventual access to public markets. The partnership between SBDG and C2C Private Investment Company merges expertise in business development with investment management capabilities, creating a comprehensive approach to value creation within the lower middle market space.</p><p>The strategic emphasis on companies with revenues between $5 million and $50 million positions the fund to capture opportunities in a market segment that typically falls between traditional venture capital investments and larger private equity transactions. This targeted methodology allows for more personalized attention and customized growth strategies for portfolio companies, potentially resulting in more successful outcomes when these businesses eventually pursue public market listings or other exit strategies. The announcement was distributed through <a href="https://www.InvestorWire.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">InvestorWire</a>, a specialized communications platform that provides advanced wire-grade press release syndication services for private and public companies within the investment community.</p><p>For business leaders and investors, this development signals a growing recognition of the untapped potential within the lower middle market segment. The fund's approach could establish new benchmarks for how smaller enterprises access growth capital and strategic support, potentially influencing how private equity adapts to serve businesses that have traditionally been overlooked by larger investment vehicles. The success of this model could encourage similar initiatives across the financial services industry, creating more pathways for small to medium enterprises to achieve sustainable growth and market recognition.</p>
