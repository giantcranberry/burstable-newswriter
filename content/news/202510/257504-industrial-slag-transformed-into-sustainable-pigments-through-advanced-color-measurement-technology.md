<p>A collaborative research initiative between Threenh Technology and academic institutions has developed a method to transform industrial slag, a problematic byproduct of metal refining, into commercially viable pigments through advanced color measurement and processing control. The study published in Ceramics International establishes a scientific foundation for converting waste materials into sustainable colorants, addressing both environmental concerns and industrial needs.</p><p>The research utilized Threenh Technology's CR8 spectrocolorimeter from https://colorimeter.com to analyze slag samples under various processing conditions. The instrument's D/8 geometry with diffuse illumination and 8° directional reception, combined with high-precision spectroscopic technology and full-spectrum LED light source, enabled accurate measurement of spectral reflectance across the 400-700 nm wavelength range. This precision allowed researchers to calculate colorimetric values (L*, a*, b*) using D65 standard illuminant with 10° observer angle, ensuring consistency with human visual perception.</p><p>The study revealed that controlling basicity and firing temperature enables production of pigments spanning from reddish yellow to bluish green hues. Slag with lower basicity (approximately 0.39) yielded reddish yellow pigments but caused more crucible erosion during processing, while higher basicity shifted colors toward bluish green due to mineral phase changes. Temperature control proved equally critical, with slag fired at 1100 °C producing lighter pigments compared to those processed at 1000 °C or 1200 °C.</p><p>This breakthrough addresses multiple environmental challenges simultaneously. Traditional slag recycling methods are energy-intensive and generate additional waste, while conventional pigment production relies on resource-heavy mining operations. The slag-to-pigment conversion reduces landfill waste, minimizes the environmental footprint of colorant production, and enables creation of eco-friendly products including ceramics, coatings, and decorative materials.</p><p>The CR8 spectrocolorimeter's role extends beyond basic color measurement, providing diagnostic insights into material behavior. Color variations can indicate changes in microstructure, erosion patterns, or crystalline phase formation, making the technology valuable for both research laboratories and industrial quality assurance. The instrument's vertical multifunctional modules, combined with light shields and culture dishes, ensure stable light paths and sample uniformity during measurement of powdered slag samples sized between 0.425 mm and 0.6 mm.</p><p>This research represents a paradigm shift in how industries view metallurgical byproducts, transforming waste management into value creation. The ability to precisely correlate processing conditions with pigment properties through reliable color measurement opens new possibilities for large-scale industrial production of sustainable materials. Future applications could extend beyond pigments to forecasting material stability and corrosion resistance, potentially expanding slag's use in construction materials and advanced composites, offering industries new pathways toward circular economy principles while reducing environmental impact.</p>
