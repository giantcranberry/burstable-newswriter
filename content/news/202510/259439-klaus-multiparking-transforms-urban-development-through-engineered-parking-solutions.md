<p>Christopher Tiessen, President and CEO of KLAUS Multiparking America, leads the U.S. operations of a 118-year-old German engineering company that is redefining how developers approach parking infrastructure in dense urban environments. The company's mechanical and automated parking solutions are transforming parking from a development constraint into a competitive advantage for commercial real estate projects across major metropolitan markets.</p><p>KLAUS has been engineering parking stackers since 1964 and marks its 35th anniversary in the United States this October. As one of the few family-owned legacy manufacturers in the parking industry, with Mrs. Klaus still serving on the board of directors in Germany, KLAUS maintains a commitment to exceptional customer service and uncompromising build quality that has weathered numerous economic cycles.</p><p>The company's approach centers on transforming parking from a cost center into a value creator, particularly in high-cost markets like New York, San Francisco, Jersey City, and Miami where land costs can exceed development budgets. At The Mather in Tysons Corner, Virginia, KLAUS installed 390 parking spaces using their SingleUp 3015 stacker systems, significantly reducing the parking footprint and allowing the developer to prioritize additional living space, green areas, and luxury amenities.</p><p>KLAUS operates as a partnership-based business development organization rather than simply a parking system provider. The company engages early with architects, developers, and planners from the entitlement phase forward, allowing parking solutions to directly influence building layout, unlock density bonuses, reduce excavation costs, and simplify municipal approvals. At Swift & Co. in Jersey City, KLAUS partnered with SILVERMAN from the early design phase to create a parking solution tailored to the project's unique mixed-use needs.</p><p>Sustainability is embedded in every KLAUS solution, with systems that eliminate the "cruising" for parking that drives unnecessary COâ‚‚ emissions. Vehicles remain "off" and unoccupied during the parking process and are stacked immediately, cutting out the search loop and associated emissions. The condensed parking footprint also frees up area for green space, rain gardens, and public realm improvements that support biodiversity and better stormwater management.</p><p>The growing demand for EV charging infrastructure is transforming KLAUS's product offerings. At a luxury condominium project in Manhattan's Gramercy Park neighborhood, the company delivered its MasterVario R3C fully automatic parking system with integrated EV charging capability. The E-Parking system enables electric vehicles to charge directly on movable parking platforms, with charging equipment moving seamlessly with the platform as vehicles are automatically stored and retrieved.</p><p>Beyond dense urban cores, KLAUS is seeing opportunities in areas like Jackson Hole, Wyoming, and Ketchum, Idaho, where developers are recognizing the value of creating premium amenities and improving user experience even in locations with ample space. The company's vision extends to making "KLAUS" synonymous with mechanical parking, delivering engineered solutions that unlock development potential and create long-term value for developers, architects, and city planners.</p><p>Under Tiessen's leadership, which blends German discipline with American entrepreneurial agility, KLAUS maintains a Customers First mindset despite economic challenges including tariffs and supply chain issues. The company's disciplined approach to growth has built trust through reliable delivery, proactive support, and uncompromising build quality. KLAUS's future involves redefining how parking is designed and integrated into the next generation of urban and suburban development, contributing to smarter infrastructure that serves both current and future generations.</p>
