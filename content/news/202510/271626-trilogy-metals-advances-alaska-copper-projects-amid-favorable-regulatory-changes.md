<p>Trilogy Metals Inc. is strategically positioned to advance its copper-rich assets in Alaska following significant regulatory developments that reduce key obstacles to mineral development. Two major policy changes are creating favorable conditions for the company's projects in the Ambler Mining District, where it holds substantial interests through its 50% stake in Ambler Metals LLC.</p><p>The first development involves the U.S. House of Representatives passing a resolution to overturn restrictive land designations in central Yukon, opening millions of acres previously unavailable for mineral development. This legislative action removes significant barriers to accessing mineral-rich lands that have been locked away from development for years. The second crucial development comes from federal executive action advancing the proposed Ambler Access Road in Northwest Alaska, a long-sought industrial corridor that Trilogy has identified as essential for accessing its mining assets.</p><p>These regulatory breakthroughs come at a critical time as demand for metals essential to clean energy and electrification continues to increase. Copper, in particular, has become a focal point for national security concerns as the United States seeks to strengthen its domestic supply chains for critical minerals. The Ambler Mining District represents one of the richest and most prospective copper-dominant districts globally, hosting world-class polymetallic volcanogenic massive sulphide deposits containing copper, zinc, lead, gold, and silver, along with carbonate replacement deposits that feature high-grade copper and cobalt mineralization.</p><p>Through Ambler Metals, Trilogy holds a 100% interest in the Upper Kobuk Mineral Projects spanning approximately 190,929 hectares in northwestern Alaska. Exploration efforts have concentrated on two primary deposits: the Arctic VMS deposit and the Bornite carbonate replacement deposit. The company's partnership with South32, a globally diversified mining company that exercised its option to form a 50/50 joint venture with Trilogy in December 2019, provides additional technical and financial capacity for project advancement.</p><p>Ambler Metals has established a framework for exploration and potential development through an agreement with NANA Regional Corporation, Inc., an Alaska Native Corporation, ensuring cooperation with local communities while protecting subsistence livelihoods. As government action increasingly aligns toward unlocking mineral lands and facilitating infrastructure development, Trilogy Metals has the opportunity to progress from exploration toward full development, potentially transforming its Ambler Mining District projects into leading contributors to mineral security for both Alaska and the United States.
