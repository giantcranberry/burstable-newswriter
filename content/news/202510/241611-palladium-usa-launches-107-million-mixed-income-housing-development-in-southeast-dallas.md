<p>Palladium USA has commenced construction on Palladium Buckner Station, a $107 million mixed-income housing development in Southeast Dallas that will provide 304 residences with direct access to public transportation. The project, located at 400 S. Buckner Boulevard adjacent to the Buckner DART Station, aims to enhance community connectivity while addressing the region's affordable housing challenges.</p><p>Tom Huth, President and CEO of Palladium USA, emphasized the development's significance during the October 2, 2025 groundbreaking ceremony. Construction has started, and we are proud to break ground on this transformational community, which reflects Palladium USA's ongoing commitment to providing high-quality, mixed-income housing in Dallas, Huth stated. The property will deliver 304 thoughtfully designed homes with convenient access to public transportation.</p><p>The development's housing mix includes one-, two-, and three-bedroom units, with 244 units reserved for families earning up to 60% of the area median income at below-market rates. An additional 60 units will be offered at market rates, creating an economically diverse community. The project also features 30 three-bedroom, two-story townhomes, providing larger affordable housing options within the neighborhood.</p><p>The strategic location next to the Buckner DART Station represents a key component of the development's community benefits. This proximity to public transportation aims to reduce transportation costs for residents while improving access to employment centers, educational institutions, and commercial districts throughout the Dallas area. The development aligns with urban planning principles that prioritize transit-oriented development to create more sustainable, connected communities.</p><p>Palladium USA's commitment to creating vibrant, inclusive communities through sustainable housing development is detailed on their website at <a href="https://palladiumusa.com/dallas-tx" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://palladiumusa.com/dallas-tx</a>. The company focuses on community engagement and development strategies that enhance residents' lives while contributing positively to Dallas neighborhoods. The Buckner Station project represents one of the larger mixed-income developments in Southeast Dallas and reflects ongoing efforts to address housing affordability while promoting economic diversity.</p><p>The groundbreaking ceremony featured remarks from community leaders and development partners, along with a ceremonial soil turn, project renderings, and community refreshments. The event marked a significant milestone for Southeast Dallas, where mixed-income housing developments play a crucial role in neighborhood revitalization and economic stability. The project's completion is expected to provide housing options for diverse income levels while strengthening the area's transportation infrastructure and community cohesion.</p>
