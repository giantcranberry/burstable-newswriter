<p>Belkin Burden Goldman, LLP has significantly expanded its legal team with the addition of Matthew N. Tobias as a partner in its Co-op and Condo Law Practice, along with four new associate attorneys joining across multiple departments. The expansion represents the firm's continued emphasis on growth and enhanced client service capabilities in the competitive New York real estate legal market.</p><p>Mr. Tobias brings more than two decades of specialized experience advising cooperatives and condominiums on corporate governance, operational disputes, and building management issues. His unique background includes serving on the Board of Directors and as President of his own cooperative, providing him with dual perspective as both a seasoned attorney and former board leader. This combination enables him to navigate governance and operational challenges with practical understanding of both legal requirements and board management realities.</p><p>The new partner's educational background includes degrees from Cornell University and Fordham University School of Law, complemented by extensive civil litigation experience. Mr. Tobias has demonstrated success in high-stakes governance matters through appellate courts, adding significant depth to BBG's existing capabilities. Daniel Altman, Co-Managing Partner and Transactional Department Co-Chair, noted that Mr. Tobias's governance expertise and litigation background will make him an invaluable asset to both clients and the broader BBG team.</p><p>In addition to the senior appointment, the firm has welcomed four associate attorneys across key practice areas. Isabella Pisani joins the Transactional Department, while Amanda Zifchak and Daniel Kirshblum strengthen the Litigation Department. Jonathan Lerch has joined the Administrative Department, further expanding the firm's comprehensive service offerings. These strategic hires reflect BBG's commitment to maintaining robust representation across all aspects of real estate law.</p><p>Jeffrey L. Goldman, Co-Managing Partner and Litigation Department Co-Chair, emphasized that these personnel additions reinforce the firm's depth and ensure clients receive superior representation throughout their legal engagements. The expansion comes as BBG continues to represent over 300 cooperative and condominium buildings throughout New York City, positioning the firm to handle increasingly complex real estate legal matters in the evolving urban landscape.</p><p>The firm's enhanced team structure addresses growing demand for sophisticated legal counsel in cooperative and condominium governance, particularly as building boards face new regulatory challenges and operational complexities. With more than 60 experienced real estate attorneys, BBG maintains its position as a full-service firm capable of providing tailored solutions to co-ops, condos, and their managing agents across all facets of real estate law including appellate litigation, construction, land use, and transaction matters.</p>
