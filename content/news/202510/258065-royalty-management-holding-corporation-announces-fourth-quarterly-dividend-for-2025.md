<p>Royalty Management Holding Corporation has declared its fourth quarterly cash dividend payment for 2025, continuing the company's shareholder return initiative established last year. The dividend of $0.0025 per share will be payable to shareholders of record as of December 31, 2025, with payment scheduled for January 10, 2026. This marks the third installment in a series of quarterly cash dividend payments by the Nasdaq-listed company.</p><p>Chief Executive Officer Thomas Sauve emphasized that the dividend program represents a strategic approach to returning excess cash to shareholders while maintaining the company's investment capabilities. This announced fourth quarter dividend is part of a program announced last year and approved by our board of directors as a way to help provide additional cash return to our shareholders, Sauve stated. The company's business model as a royalty company positions it to benefit from expanding operations within its investment portfolio.</p><p>Royalty Management's approach focuses on acquiring and developing high-value assets across resource-driven and emerging technology industries. The company's strategy involves structuring cash flow streams around assets that can support both shareholder returns and community benefits. According to company information available at <a href="https://www.royaltymgmtcorp.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.royaltymgmtcorp.com</a>, the model aims to monetize current cash flow streams while identifying transitional cash flows for future growth.</p><p>The dividend announcement reflects the company's confidence in its income generation capabilities as its investments and portfolio companies expand their operations. Sauve noted the company's excitement about our ability to return some of this excess cash to shareholders, balanced with our commitment to continue investing in royalty projects. This balanced approach allows Royalty Management to maintain its investment momentum while providing tangible returns to investors.</p><p>The company's portfolio includes interests in emerging technologies, including its association with ReElement Technologies Corporation, which focuses on rare earth and critical battery element refining. Information about ReElement's multi-mineral, multi-feedstock platform technology can be found at <a href="https://www.reelementtech.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.reelementtech.com</a>. The connection to such emerging technology sectors underscores Royalty Management's positioning in growth-oriented industries that can generate sustainable royalty streams.</p><p>This consistent dividend payment schedule provides shareholders with predictable returns while the company continues to build its asset portfolio across various market environments. The announcement reinforces Royalty Management's commitment to its stated objective of building shareholder value through strategic acquisitions and development of high-value assets. The company's forward-looking approach to royalty management demonstrates how traditional investment models can adapt to modern market opportunities while maintaining shareholder-friendly policies.</p>
