<p>The Hong Kong Trade Development Council (HKTDC) has undergone significant leadership changes with Sophia Chong assuming the role of Executive Director effective October 1, 2025. Chong immediately emphasized Hong Kong's critical position as both a superconnector and super value-adder in the current global economic environment, highlighting the organization's commitment to leveraging Hong Kong's unique advantages to help businesses improve competitiveness and explore new markets.</p><p>Chong articulated that the HKTDC will continue standing with Hong Kong businesses through global uncertainties while simultaneously working to attract more companies to utilize Hong Kong as their international growth platform. This dual approach aims to generate fresh economic momentum and reinforce the city's status as an international business hub. The organization's extensive global network, detailed at <a href="https://www.hktdc.com/aboutus" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.hktdc.com/aboutus</a>, provides crucial support for these international expansion initiatives.</p><p>Concurrent with Chong's appointment, Jenny Koo assumed the position of Deputy Executive Director, taking responsibility for international exhibitions, related services, and digital business operations. Chong praised Koo's extensive experience serving both the HKTDC and small and medium-sized enterprises, noting her broad perspective across multiple domains. Chong expressed confidence that Koo's expertise and innovative approach would enable the team to deliver dynamic outcomes while helping businesses navigate challenges and identify new opportunities.</p><p>Koo brings substantial institutional knowledge to her new role, having previously served as Assistant Executive Director overseeing exhibitions and digital business initiatives with a focus on promoting Hong Kong's external trade. Her career includes significant digital transformation achievements, particularly during her tenure as Director of Exhibition Market Development in 2020 when she successfully migrated physical exhibitions to virtual platforms. In 2021, as Director of Digital Business, Koo led the development and implementation of the HKTDC's digitalization strategies and oversaw upgrades to the ourhktdc.com Sourcing platform, enabling SMEs to better adopt digital technologies.</p><p>These leadership transitions occur as global trade patterns continue to evolve, requiring adaptive strategies from trade promotion organizations. The HKTDC's renewed focus on digital business capabilities and international market access reflects broader trends in global commerce, where hybrid physical-digital approaches and strategic market positioning have become essential for business success. The organization's commitment to supporting SMEs through these changes remains central to its mission of developing Hong Kong's trade relationships worldwide, positioning the city to capitalize on emerging opportunities in the rapidly changing global economic landscape.</p>
