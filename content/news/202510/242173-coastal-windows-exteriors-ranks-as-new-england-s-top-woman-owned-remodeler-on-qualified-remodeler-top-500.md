<p>Coastal Windows & Exteriors has been recognized on the 2025 Qualified Remodeler Top 500, ranking as New England's #1 woman-owned exterior remodeler and the only roofing company in the New England region to make the list. The family-owned company has climbed more than 200 positions in just four years, including a 42-spot jump since last year, to reach #191 nationally and #4 overall in New England. With 842+ verified Google A+ reviews with a 4.8-star rating, Coastal stands apart as the region's most trusted remodeler, delivering award-winning service in roofing, windows, doors and siding.</p><p>In an industry increasingly dominated by private equity firms and national franchises, Coastal Windows & Exteriors stands out as a family-owned, woman-led company that has climbed more than 200 spots in just four years. Owner Stephanie Vanderbilt was named Massachusetts Small Business Person of the Year by the U.S. Small Business Administration — national recognition that underscores Coastal's strength as an independent business competing at the highest level. While women hold only 13% of construction jobs nationwide according to the <a href="https://www.bls.gov" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics</a>, far fewer lead exterior remodeling firms at this scale. This makes Coastal's achievement as New England's #1 woman-owned remodeler — and the only roofing company in the region's Top 500 — especially significant.</p><p>The company's recognition includes multiple industry honors beyond the Qualified Remodeler ranking. Coastal received the James Hardie President's Club Award as the only contractor in New England and only woman in the U.S. to achieve this distinction. The company also maintains GAF Master Elite® Roofing Contractor status and has earned the Service Excellence Award. These certifications and awards demonstrate the company's commitment to quality and professionalism in exterior remodeling services.</p><p>"Being named to the Qualified Remodeler Top 500 is a tremendous honor," said Stephanie Vanderbilt, founder and owner of Coastal Windows & Exteriors. "Homeowners deserve transparency — they want to see reviews, photos, and proof of work before choosing a contractor. Our ranking, combined with our strong online presence and 842+ of 5-star reviews, shows customers exactly who we are and why they can trust us."</p><p>Tommy Ingram, General Manager of Coastal Windows & Exteriors, added that climbing to #4 in New England reflects the values the team lives every day. The company emphasizes being their best when it matters most, communicating with honesty and transparency, and always putting people first. These principles have earned the trust of homeowners across New England and are credited as the reason for continued year-over-year growth.</p><p>Industry partners have recognized Coastal's innovative approach and commitment to quality. Marc Setty, Sr. Director of the Remodeling Segment at James Hardie, noted that Coastal continues to set a powerful example of leadership and excellence in the industry. Cullen Vumbaco, GAF Territory Manager for Greater Boston, described Coastal as one of the most innovative and respected companies he's worked with, emphasizing that the company stands by its products and installations.</p><p>Beyond business achievements, Coastal Windows & Exteriors maintains strong community involvement through various initiatives. The company operates a Roof for Heroes Program that provides free roofing systems for local veterans and has donated over $375,000 to <a href="https://www.habitat.org" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Habitat for Humanity</a> to support affordable housing projects across Massachusetts. Additional community support includes donating more than 3,000 pounds of food to local pantries such as Beverly Bootstraps and Open Door Gloucester. The company is also an active member of National Women in Roofing, advancing diversity and inclusion in the industry.</p><p>Qualified Remodeler's Top 500 serves as the remodeling industry's longest-running benchmark, ranking firms nationwide on revenue, professionalism, and impact. Coastal's recognition reflects not only strong business growth but also its reputation for trust, quality, and community commitment. The company's position at #4 in New England and #191 nationally represents significant progress for women in construction leadership and demonstrates the viability of family-owned businesses competing successfully against larger corporate entities in the home improvement industry.</p>
