<p>Healthcare Triangle, Inc. has secured approximately $1.63 million in immediate gross proceeds through warrant exercise agreements with existing accredited and institutional investors. The transaction involves the exercise of outstanding warrants for 812,775 shares of common stock, with investors receiving new warrants in a private placement as consideration for immediate exercise. This financial restructuring represents a strategic move to strengthen the company's position in the competitive digital healthcare solutions market.</p><p>The warrant inducement agreement significantly reduces the exercise price of existing warrants from $20.92 to $2.00 per share, making the exercise substantially more attractive to current warrant holders. In exchange for exercising their existing warrants, investors will receive new warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 812,775 shares of common stock, representing 100% of the shares issued through the exercise of the existing warrants. The new warrants carry an exercise price of $3.00 per share and become exercisable once stockholder approval is obtained, remaining valid for five years from the date of such approval.</p><p>The transaction is expected to close on October 2, 2025, subject to customary closing conditions, with <a href="https://wallachbeth.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">WallachBeth Capital</a> serving as the sole placement agent for the warrant inducement. This financial maneuver provides Healthcare Triangle with immediate capital while maintaining investor participation through the new warrant structure, demonstrating continued confidence in the company's growth trajectory and strategic direction.</p><p>The capital infusion comes at a critical juncture for healthcare technology, as organizations increasingly rely on digital transformation to improve health outcomes through better utilization of data and information technologies. Healthcare Triangle's expertise spans cloud implementation, security and compliance, data lifecycle management, healthcare interoperability, and clinical and business performance optimization. The company has achieved <a href="https://hitrustalliance.net" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">HITRUST Certification</a> for its Cloud and Data Platform, marketed as CloudEz and DataEz, demonstrating its commitment to maintaining the highest standards for data protection and information security in the highly regulated healthcare industry.</p><p>This funding positions Healthcare Triangle to continue supporting hospitals, health systems, payers, and pharmaceutical organizations in their digital transformation journeys while responding to immediate business needs and competitive threats in the evolving healthcare technology landscape. The immediate capital availability enables the company to accelerate development of its certified platforms and expand its service offerings to meet growing demand for secure, compliant digital healthcare solutions. As healthcare organizations face increasing pressure to modernize infrastructure while maintaining regulatory compliance, Healthcare Triangle's certified platforms and expanded financial resources position it as a key player in driving the industry's digital evolution.</p>
