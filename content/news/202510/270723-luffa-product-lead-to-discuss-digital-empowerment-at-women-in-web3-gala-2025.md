<p>Luffa, the decentralized messaging platform, announced that its Head of Product Esra Ozturk will be a featured speaker at the Women in Web3 Gala 2025: An Evening of Innovation and Impact. The event brings together global changemakers across technology, art, finance, and philanthropy to celebrate women driving innovation in blockchain and AI. Ozturk will participate in the panel "The Future of Digital Empowerment: Web 3, AI and Ownership Economy" scheduled for 7:10 pm during the gala, hosted by the Global CSR Foundation aboard a luxury yacht in Marina del Rey, California on November 8, 2025.</p><p>The discussion will examine how emerging technologies are rewriting the rules of ownership, creativity, and opportunity, with particular focus on how women are leading the development of a more inclusive, values-driven digital world. "We're at a turning point where creativity, ownership, and identity are no longer defined by platforms - they're defined by people," said Ozturk. "At Luffa, we're building the infrastructure that allows fans, creators, and brands to own their relationships and value directly." This perspective reflects the broader industry shift toward decentralized models that prioritize user ownership and control over traditional platform-centric approaches.</p><p>Since joining Luffa earlier this year, Ozturk has been leading the company's product vision and strategy, developing decentralized tools that power authentic connection and collaboration across culture, entertainment, and commerce. Her decade of experience driving product innovation at the intersection of behavior, technology, and community includes previous roles at Uber, Meta, and Zillow. Yu Xiong, Founding Advisor at Luffa, noted that "Esra brings the rare ability to fuse technical depth with cultural insight. Her leadership reflects our core belief that technology should amplify creativity and human connection, not replace it."</p><p>The Women in Web3 Gala's immersive, yacht-based format is designed to foster meaningful dialogue and partnerships that shape the future of the digital ownership economy. Luffa itself represents this evolving landscape as a decentralized messaging and community platform built for the fan economy where privacy, participation, and creator ownership converge. The platform combines end-to-end encryption with interoperable architecture, enabling creators, brands, and fans to engage securely across digital and physical experiences. Its forthcoming Loyalty Layer connects engagement with real-world rewards, creating a seamless bridge between attention and value in the next evolution of online communities.</p><p>This approach reflects Ozturk's perspective that "it's not just about technology - it's about restoring humanity to the digital economy." For business leaders and technology executives, the implications extend beyond messaging platforms to broader questions about digital ownership, creator economies, and the infrastructure needed to support more equitable digital ecosystems. The convergence of Web3, AI, and decentralized communication platforms like Luffa signals a fundamental shift in how value is created and distributed online, with significant implications for industries ranging from entertainment and media to e-commerce and social networking.</p>
