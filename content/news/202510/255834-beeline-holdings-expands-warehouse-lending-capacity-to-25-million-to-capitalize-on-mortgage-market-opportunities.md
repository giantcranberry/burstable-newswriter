<p>Beeline Holdings, a digital mortgage platform trading on NASDAQ under the symbol BLNE, has expanded its warehouse lending capacity from $5 million to $25 million to support accelerated revenue growth and increased loan origination volume. The expansion comes as the company positions itself to capitalize on rising demand in the mortgage market ahead of expected interest rate reductions.</p><p>The company's existing $5 million line with First Funding has been increased to $15 million, while new $5 million facilities have been added from both Customers Bank and Northpointe Bank. This strategic financial expansion provides Beeline with significantly enhanced lending capabilities during a period of growing market opportunity. With warehouse lines typically turning approximately three times per month, the increased capacity now enables Beeline to originate up to $75 million in monthly loans.</p><p>This substantial increase in lending capacity represents a critical step for the Providence, Rhode Island-based fintech company as it seeks to transform the homeownership process through its fully digital, AI-powered platform. The timing of this expansion aligns with industry expectations of upcoming interest rate cuts, which typically stimulate increased mortgage activity as borrowing costs become more attractive to potential homebuyers and real estate investors.</p><p>The enhanced warehouse facilities will support Beeline's mission to deliver faster, smarter paths to home loans for both primary residences and investment properties. As a digital mortgage platform, Beeline focuses on reshaping mortgage origination with speed, simplicity, and transparency as core principles. The company's approach aims to level the playing field in property financing by providing what it describes as the fastest, simplest loans available in the market.</p><p>For additional information about the company and its forward-looking statements, investors can refer to the full terms of use and disclaimers available at <a href="http://IBN.fm/Disclaimer" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://IBN.fm/Disclaimer</a>.
