<p>Infinx has announced a strategic investment in Voxology AI, integrating conversational voice agents into its healthcare revenue cycle management platform. The partnership addresses critical challenges facing healthcare providers, including overwhelming call volumes, staffing shortages, and excessive patient hold times that degrade the front desk experience.</p><p>The integration embeds Voxology AI's voice-first automation directly into Infinx's contact center solutions, creating a unified platform that spans from back-office revenue cycle management to patient-facing front-office workflows. These AI agents answer inbound calls, handle appointment scheduling and changes, and triage complex requests using natural, empathetic conversation in multiple languages including English and Spanish.</p><p>Jaideep Tandon, CEO of Infinx, emphasized the operational impact of the technology. Call volume, staffing shortages, and long hold times are crushing the front desk experience, Tandon stated. With Voxology's AI agents embedded into our patient access workflows, providers can offer 24/7 scheduling support without adding headcount, while giving patients a faster, more compassionate experience from the first call.</p><p>The voice agents are designed to understand complex scheduling logic and electronic medical record availability, operating around the clock to reduce hold times and call abandonment. Aakarsh Sethi, founder of Voxology AI, highlighted the strategic importance of the patient's initial contact. Phone calls are still the #1 way patients schedule appointments. That moment is where both patient experience and revenue truly begin, Sethi explained. Together with Infinx, we're turning the front office into a proactive, AI-powered access hub where patient experience meets provider success.</p><p>The offering is available through three deployment models: as a standalone software-as-a-service module within the platform, as a tech-enabled contact center service combining AI with live agent support, or as a hybrid approach that adapts to specific operational needs. Navaneeth Nair, Chief Product Officer at Infinx, stressed the practical implementation advantages. Anyone can build a voice agent that looks good in a demo. But scaling that into a production workload that's accurate, resilient, and backed by real operations, that's where most fail, Nair noted. With Voxology AI and our human-in-the-loop infrastructure, Infinx is delivering agentic AI that works in the real world and scales seamlessly within our Healthcare Revenue Cloud platform.</p><p>Early results from providers using Voxology AI technology demonstrate significant operational improvements, including 40%-60% reduction in front-office administrative call volume, 5%-7% increase in new patient appointments, and 95%+ reduction in after-hours answering-service call volumes. The technology has also shown higher patient satisfaction across diverse populations, indicating broad applicability across different patient demographics.
