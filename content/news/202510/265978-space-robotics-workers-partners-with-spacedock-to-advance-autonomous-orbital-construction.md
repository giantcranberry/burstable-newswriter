<p>Space Robotics Workers has chosen Spacedock's intelligent interface system for integration with its robotic Smart Truss technology, representing a significant advancement in orbital construction capabilities. The partnership will enable autonomous capture and structural connection between Smart Truss units using Spacedock's interface, which supports autonomous berthing, docking, and transfer of power, fluid, and data between modular space components.</p><p>The companies plan to conduct a ground demonstration in early 2026 to validate the integration in a ground-based analog environment. This testing marks a critical milestone toward SRW's roadmap for robotic construction of Commercial LEO Destination platforms, solar power stations, and other persistent orbital structures that could transform how space infrastructure is built and maintained.</p><p>Negar Feher, CEO of Spacedock, emphasized the broader implications of the collaboration, stating that their intelligent interface accelerates the shift toward a modular, serviceable, and sustainable space ecosystem. By making orbital systems upgradeable and maintainable, the technology helps protect billions in space assets and extend mission lifetimes, addressing key challenges in space infrastructure development.</p><p>Raffaele Vitulli, Technical Director of SRW, explained that selecting Spacedock represents more than just an interface choice but reflects confidence in an architecture that can scale with their vision for permanent human presence in orbit. The Spanish company develops autonomous robotics technologies specifically for on-orbit assembly and servicing operations.</p><p>Spacedock's universal interface system combines AI-powered hardware and software to enable rapid hosted-payload integration and secure connections between space systems. Each interface unit functions as a data node for AI-driven diagnostics, cybersecurity, and optimization, forming what the company describes as the backbone of interoperable, upgradable space infrastructure. Additional information about the company's technology is available at <a href="https://Spacedock.co" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://Spacedock.co</a>.</p><p>The collaboration between these two space technology innovators addresses the growing need for sustainable orbital infrastructure as commercial space activities expand. By enabling robotic assembly and maintenance of large-scale structures in space, the technology could significantly reduce costs and risks associated with human spacewalks while increasing the longevity and functionality of orbital assets.</p>
