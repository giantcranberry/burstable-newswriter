<p>PowerBank Corporation has executed agreements with the New York State Division of Military and Naval Affairs to develop a 20 MW DC portfolio of solar and battery storage projects across multiple Army National Guard facilities. Selected through a competitive process led by the New York Power Authority, the portfolio represents a significant advancement in military energy resilience while supporting New York's broader climate objectives.</p><p>The project portfolio includes ground mount, rooftop, and parking canopy systems, comprising approximately 19 MW of solar generation capacity and 1 MW/2 MWh of battery storage. This diversified approach to renewable energy infrastructure will help the DMNA achieve its multiple objectives of enhanced energy security, climate action, and operational cost savings. The integration of battery storage is particularly crucial for maintaining critical military operations during grid disruptions or emergencies.</p><p>Construction on the projects is expected to begin by the end of 2025, with PowerBank's U.S. subsidiary, Abundant Solar Power, leading both development and financing efforts. The distributed nature of these installations across multiple military facilities creates a resilient energy network that can continue operating even if individual sites experience challenges. This approach aligns with growing national security concerns about energy independence and infrastructure vulnerability.</p><p>The project development follows PowerBank's established focus on distributed and community solar projects across North America. The company has developed renewable and clean energy projects with a combined capacity of over 100 megawatts and maintains a potential development pipeline of over one gigawatt. Additional information about the company's operations can be found at <a href="https://ibn.fm/8xKD1" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://ibn.fm/8xKD1</a>.</p><p>This initiative represents part of New York's broader commitment to renewable energy development and military facility modernization. The partnership between private renewable energy developers and state military operations demonstrates how clean energy infrastructure can serve multiple purposes beyond environmental benefits, including national security enhancement and operational efficiency. The project's timing aligns with increasing focus on military energy resilience at both state and federal levels, potentially setting a precedent for similar collaborations nationwide.</p>
