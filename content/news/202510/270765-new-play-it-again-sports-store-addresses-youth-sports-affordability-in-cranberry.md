<p>The recent opening of Play It Again Sports in Cranberry at 19097 Perry Hwy offers local families a solution to the escalating costs of youth sports participation. The store specializes in buying, selling, and trading quality used sports and fitness equipment, directly addressing financial barriers that often prevent children from participating in athletic activities.</p><p>Owners Aaron and Rebecca Jaynes were inspired to open the store after experiencing firsthand the financial challenges of youth sports with their 10-year-old son, who had tried multiple sports including hockey, baseball, and lacrosse. Each activity required expensive equipment, creating significant financial strain. The couple discovered the Play It Again Sports concept during a visit to Ohio, where they found affordable gear that sparked their decision to bring the business model to their North Pittsburgh community.</p><p>Rebecca Jaynes emphasized the store's mission to remove financial barriers from youth sports. Every kid deserves the chance to play sports, but the cost of youth sports equipment can sometimes limit opportunities, she explained. With this new store, we hope to eliminate cost as a barrier so more kids can try new activities and discover the sports they love. This approach aligns with Cranberry's strong sports culture, which includes professional teams, youth leagues, and multiple universities and school districts in the area.</p><p>Beyond affordability, the store contributes to environmental sustainability by keeping sports equipment out of landfills. The business accepts new and quality used equipment from community members, allowing gear to be reused rather than discarded. Unlike typical consignment stores, Play It Again Sports pays on the spot for equipment without requiring appointments, making the selling process more convenient for local residents.</p><p>Play It Again Sports is part of <a href="https://playitagainsports.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Winmark â€“ the Resale Company</a>, a national franchise network focused on sustainability and small business formation. The brand operates over 300 franchised stores across the United States and Canada. Winmark franchise brands collectively have helped recycle over 2 billion items since 2010, demonstrating the significant environmental impact of the resale model.</p><p>The Cranberry location joins a growing network of resale businesses that includes Plato's Closet, Once Upon A Child, Style Encore, and Music Go Round, all franchised by Winmark. As of June 28, 2025, there were 1,371 franchises in operation across these brands, with 77 additional franchises awarded but not yet open, indicating continued expansion of the resale retail concept. This growth reflects increasing consumer demand for affordable alternatives and sustainable shopping options across multiple retail categories.</p>
