<p>Critical Infrastructure Technologies Ltd. has formed SIA CiTech Europe, a wholly owned Latvian subsidiary that will serve as the company's European headquarters beginning in 2026. The Vancouver-based developer of autonomous mobile communications platforms plans to establish a manufacturing facility and dedicated sales force in Latvia to serve markets across Europe.</p><p>The company is in advanced discussions to locate the new facility in the Special Economic Zone in the port city of Liepaja, leveraging the region's logistical advantages and strategic location within the European Union. The SEZ currently offers a corporate tax rate of 4%, providing financial incentives for the expansion. As part of its due diligence process, CiTech has conducted high-level meetings with key Latvian stakeholders including the Ministry of Defence, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Latvian Investment and Development Agency, Armed Forces Command, Liepaja Local Government, and Liepaja Special Economic Zone Agency.</p><p>Brenton Scott, CEO of CiTech, stated that the company is accelerating its establishment in Latvia to build strong partnerships and create a hub supporting defense, border security, surveillance, infrastructure, and innovation across European markets. The establishment of SIA CiTech Europe represents a long-term commitment to Europe and strengthens the company's international footprint. These engagements have confirmed Latvia's attractiveness as the home for the company's European operations.</p><p>CiTech specializes in autonomous, high-capacity, rapidly deployable technology that delivers essential services to remote locations. The company's technology targets mining, defense, border security, surveillance, and emergency services sectors. Its first product, the Nexus 16, provides critical mobile telecommunications using patented technologies through a self-deploying platform designed to support radio equipment including LTE and various technological payloads such as surveillance and anti-drone systems.</p><p>The company has completed the research and development phase and is currently commercializing the first of many planned product releases.

The original announcement was published on <a href="https://www.newmediawire.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.newmediawire.com</a>.</p><p>This strategic expansion into Europe positions CiTech to capitalize on growing demand for autonomous communications infrastructure across defense and security sectors. The move signals increasing globalization of critical infrastructure technology companies and highlights Latvia's emergence as a strategic hub for technology manufacturing within the EU. For European markets, this expansion could accelerate the deployment of advanced mobile communications systems for border security, emergency response, and remote operations, potentially enhancing regional security capabilities and infrastructure resilience.</p>
