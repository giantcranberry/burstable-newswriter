<p>Ucore Rare Metals Inc. has secured a long-term supply agreement for heavy rare earth concentrates from Greenland's massive Tanbreez deposit, marking a significant advancement in North American critical mineral independence. The company signed a letter of intent with Critical Metals Corp. to obtain up to 10,000 metric tons annually of heavy rare earth concentrate beginning in 2027, creating reliable feedstock for Ucore's Department of Defense-supported Strategic Metals Complex in Louisiana.</p><p>This strategic arrangement addresses growing concerns about U.S. reliance on China for critical materials essential to modern technologies. The Tanbreez Project represents one of the world's largest undeveloped rare earth resources and will supply materials like dysprosium and terbium that are vital components in electric vehicle motors, wind turbine generators, and advanced defense systems. The agreement positions Ucore to leverage its proprietary RapidSXâ„¢ separation technology to process these materials domestically.</p><p>The timing of this development coincides with surging global demand for rare earth elements as nations accelerate their transitions to clean energy and advanced technologies. By establishing a secure supply chain from Greenland to Louisiana, Ucore aims to disrupt China's dominance in the North American rare earth market. The company's vision includes developing additional strategic metals complexes in Canada and Alaska, creating a fully integrated North American supply network.</p><p>For more information about Ucore's corporate strategy and technology development, visit <a href="https://www.ucore.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.ucore.com</a>. The company's progress in establishing alternative rare earth sources comes as governments worldwide prioritize supply chain security for materials deemed critical to economic and national security interests. This agreement represents a concrete step toward reducing vulnerability to geopolitical disruptions in rare earth supplies that could impact multiple high-tech industries.</p><p>The Department of Defense backing for Ucore's Louisiana facility underscores the strategic importance of developing domestic rare earth processing capabilities. As demand for these materials continues to grow across clean energy, transportation, and defense sectors, the establishment of reliable North American sources becomes increasingly vital to maintaining technological leadership and economic stability.</p>
