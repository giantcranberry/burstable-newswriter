<p>Honey Badger Silver Inc. has expanded its 100%-owned Plata project by staking an additional 1,546 hectares, increasing the total claim package by 18%. The expansion decision followed promising field observations and a comprehensive review of historical data that highlighted significant gold anomalies along the Plata Thrust structure. Historical grab samples along this thrust returned high-grade gold values over a 900-meter strike length, with the mineralization remaining open in both directions, suggesting potential for further extension.</p><p>The company also identified a large, underexplored gold-in-soil anomaly during its assessment, indicating substantial untapped potential within the expanded claim area. This discovery, combined with the historical high-grade samples, provides strong justification for the strategic land acquisition. The expanded project area now encompasses both the Plata Thrust and the parallel Rogue thrust, both of which will be targeted for their gold potential in upcoming exploration programs.</p><p>The Plata project's strategic location enhances its exploration significance, positioned 165 kilometers east of Yukon's prolific Keno Hill mining district and adjacent to Snowline Gold's Rogue discovery. This regional context suggests the expanded project area lies within a highly prospective geological setting known for significant mineralization. The company's technical team plans to systematically explore both thrust structures to better understand the gold distribution and potential economic mineralization.</p><p>Honey Badger Silver maintains several other significant projects across Canada's northern territories, including the Sunrise Lake project in the Northwest Territories with historical resources and the Clear Lake Project in the Yukon Territory. The company's land holding at the Nanisivik Mine Area in Nunavut previously produced over 20 million ounces of silver between 1976 and 2002, demonstrating the company's focus on historically productive mining regions.

By increasing its land position by 18%, Honey Badger Silver has positioned itself to conduct more comprehensive exploration across multiple thrust structures, potentially uncovering significant gold resources alongside its established silver targets. The company's approach of combining historical data analysis with modern exploration techniques could yield important discoveries in this underexplored portion of the Yukon.</p>
