<p>tZERO Group, Inc. announced that its subsidiary, tZERO Digital Asset Securities, LLC, has successfully completed its first regulatory examination without exception, marking a significant compliance milestone for the Special Purpose Broker-Dealer. The achievement comes exactly one year after the firm secured SPBD approval from regulatory authorities, demonstrating tZERO's operational strength and commitment to building trust in the emerging digital asset securities market.</p><p>As one of only two firms nationwide holding Special Purpose Broker-Dealer status, tZERO Digital Asset Securities occupies a unique position in the financial ecosystem. An SPBD is an SEC-registered broker-dealer specifically authorized to custody, clear, and facilitate trading in digital asset securities. This regulatory framework enables the company to provide correspondent custody and clearing services to other broker-dealers who lack this specialized approval, offering a regulated alternative to non-broker-dealer-led custody solutions for digital assets.</p><p>Since receiving its designation, tZERO has been providing comprehensive custody, clearing, and trading services for tokenized securities through infrastructure that combines traditional capital market safeguards with blockchain technology's efficiency and transparency benefits. The successful regulatory examination validates the company's approach to merging financial market rigor with technological innovation. More information about tZERO Digital Asset Securities regulatory standing can be found through https://brokercheck.finra.org/.</p><p>Alan Konevsky, Chief Executive Officer of tZERO, emphasized that this milestone reflects the strength of the company's operational framework and commitment to compliance. He stated that tZERO is proving daily that digital securities can be transacted and custodied with the same rigor as traditional financial instruments. The examination outcome serves as further validation that the company is delivering innovation responsibly within established regulatory frameworks.</p><p>The company's leadership position becomes increasingly valuable as the regulatory landscape continues to evolve. Konevsky noted that tZERO's experience and market presence provide a significant advantage that other broker-dealers can leverage through correspondent services. This enables firms without direct authorization for tokenized securities custody to participate in the digital asset market through tZERO's compliant infrastructure.</p><p>Alex Vlastakis, President of tZERO Digital Asset Securities, described the one-year milestone as foundational for future growth. He emphasized that the company has established the necessary infrastructure to scale operations, simplify adoption processes, and add substantial value for both issuers and investors. Rather than merely participating in the market, tZERO is actively building the secure, compliant pathways that will define the future of digital asset securities.</p><p>Since launching operations in September 2024, tZERO Digital Asset Securities has been actively custodying and supporting tokenized securities trading. The successful regulatory examination reinforces the company's role in bridging blockchain innovation with regulatory standards while advancing strategic priorities including trusted partnership development, multi-asset capability expansion, and enhanced transparency across global markets.</p>
