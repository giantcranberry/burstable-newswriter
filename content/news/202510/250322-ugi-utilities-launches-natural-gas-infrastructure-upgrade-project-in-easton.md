<p>UGI Utilities, Inc. will begin a natural gas main replacement project in Easton on Tuesday, October 14, focusing on infrastructure improvements along William Penn Highway between Indiana Street and South Nulton Avenue. The underground construction work will occur weekdays from 7:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. and is scheduled to continue through late December, representing a substantial investment in community energy infrastructure.</p><p>The project's primary objective involves enhancing the natural gas distribution system's longevity and performance, aligning with UGI's broader commitment to maintaining and modernizing utility infrastructure across its service territory. Beyond system upgrades, the initiative presents a significant opportunity for properties along the project route to convert to natural gas service, potentially offering energy efficiency benefits and cost savings for participating customers. Additional information about UGI Utilities, Inc. and its services is available at <a href="https://www.ugi.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.ugi.com</a>.</p><p>Motorists should anticipate lane restrictions during construction hours, which may affect traffic flow along the affected corridor. The utility company also notes that temporary natural gas service interruptions will occur as part of the replacement process, requiring UGI technicians to access properties to inspect equipment and perform necessary relighting procedures once service is restored. These temporary disruptions are carefully planned to minimize inconvenience while ensuring long-term system reliability.</p><p>While installation of the new natural gas main and temporary restoration work are expected to conclude by late December, final paving operations will be scheduled for a later date. This phased approach to restoration helps minimize long-term disruption while ensuring proper completion of all infrastructure improvements. The project demonstrates UGI's ongoing investment in community infrastructure that supports both current needs and future growth, while maintaining focus on safety and service quality for all utility customers.</p><p>UGI Utilities serves more than 760,000 customers throughout its service area, making these system upgrades part of a larger strategy to ensure consistent, reliable energy delivery. The Easton project represents the type of infrastructure investment that business leaders should monitor, as reliable energy infrastructure forms the foundation for economic development and operational stability. For companies considering expansion or relocation, such infrastructure improvements signal community commitment to maintaining modern utility systems that support business operations and growth.</p>
