<p>UGI Utilities, Inc. has initiated a natural gas main replacement project in Loyalsock Township this week, representing a significant infrastructure improvement that could enable homes and businesses along the construction route to convert to natural gas service. The system upgrades are part of UGI's ongoing commitment to delivering safe and reliable energy services to its customer base across Pennsylvania.</p><p>The underground construction work will focus on three key roadway segments: Country Club Drive between Edercrest Road and East Third Street, Saint Davids Road between Edercrest Road and East Third Street, and Edercrest Road between Saint Davids Road and Country Club Drive. Construction operations are scheduled Monday through Friday from 7:00am to 5:00pm, with potential impacts including lane restrictions, detours, and parking limitations for drivers, residents, and business owners in the affected areas.</p><p>During the project timeline, some interruptions to natural gas service are anticipated, requiring UGI personnel to access properties for equipment inspection and relighting procedures. The company emphasizes that temporary restoration will occur following the installation of new natural gas mains, with final paving operations scheduled for completion at a later date. Additional information about UGI Utilities, Inc. is available at <a href="https://www.ugi.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.ugi.com</a>.</p><p>This infrastructure enhancement project holds particular significance for property owners along the construction route who have previously been unable to access natural gas service. The system upgrades create a unique opportunity for conversion to natural gas, which often provides cost savings and efficiency benefits compared to alternative heating fuels. UGI Utilities, Inc. serves more than 760,000 customers across its service territory, making these infrastructure improvements part of a broader strategy to enhance service reliability and expand access to natural gas options for Pennsylvania residents and businesses.</p><p>The timing of this project aligns with increasing consumer interest in energy efficiency and cost-effective heating solutions. As natural gas prices have remained relatively stable compared to other energy sources, the conversion opportunity presented by this infrastructure work could provide long-term economic benefits for property owners in the affected areas. The project also demonstrates the ongoing maintenance and modernization efforts required to maintain safe and reliable energy delivery systems throughout the region, highlighting the critical role of infrastructure investment in supporting regional economic development and energy accessibility.</p>
