<p>HeartBeam Inc. has announced a strategic partnership with HeartNexus Inc., a network of board-certified cardiologists, to deliver 24/7 remote cardiology services and real-time ECG interpretation. This collaboration marks a significant advancement in making medical-grade cardiac monitoring accessible beyond traditional healthcare settings, potentially transforming how patients manage cardiac symptoms outside hospital environments.</p><p>The partnership enables HeartBeam to offer continuous cardiology reader services for patients experiencing cardiac symptoms at any time. Using HeartBeam's patented 3D technology, patients can capture a 30-second, cable-free ECG recording when symptoms occur and transmit the data immediately to HeartNexus cardiologists for professional interpretation. This real-time feedback system addresses the critical need for timely cardiac assessment, particularly for patients who may experience symptoms during non-business hours or while away from medical facilities.</p><p>Robert Eno, CEO of HeartBeam, emphasized the strategic importance of this collaboration, stating that working with HeartNexus accelerates the company's mission to extend medical-grade cardiac monitoring beyond traditional healthcare walls. The partnership represents a significant expansion of HeartBeam's ecosystem, incorporating real-time cardiology feedback and laying the groundwork for future integration of AI wellness features and wearable technology capabilities.</p><p>HeartBeam's technology platform represents a breakthrough in cardiac monitoring, creating the first-ever cable-free device capable of collecting ECG signals in three dimensions from non-coplanar directions and synthesizing these signals into a comprehensive 12-lead ECG. This technological advancement, which received FDA clearance for arrhythmia assessment in December 2024, allows physicians to identify cardiac health trends and acute conditions while directing patients to appropriate care entirely outside medical facilities.</p><p>The company's 12-Lead ECG synthesis software is currently under FDA review, and HeartBeam holds over 20 issued patents related to its technology enablement.
