<p>Datavault AI has announced a strategic partnership with Zurich-based Max International AG to launch the Swiss Digital RWA Exchange, creating a next-generation marketplace for real-world asset tokenization. The collaboration combines Switzerland's established financial infrastructure and regulatory framework with Datavault AI's patented data-tokenization technology, positioning the exchange as a secure entry point for institutional investors into digital asset markets.</p><p>Max International will operate and manage the exchange under Swiss digital regulatory frameworks, leveraging the country's century-old reputation for financial precision and regulatory trust. This partnership represents a significant step in Datavault AI's broader mission to monetize previously untapped assets, ranging from unmined commodities to digital likeness rights, by overcoming traditional barriers related to regulation, scalability, and fiduciary trust.</p><p>The company brings global patents for secure data tokenization and automated compliance to the partnership, aiming to transform how real-world value is authenticated, verified, and transacted at digital speeds. Datavault AI's technology suite, including its Information Data Exchange platform, enables the secure attachment of physical real-world objects to immutable metadata objects, facilitating applications such as digital twins and name, image, and likeness licensing.</p><p>This initiative expands Datavault AI's presence in the Web 3.0 environment, where the company focuses on AI-driven experience, valuation, and monetization of assets. The company's cloud-based platform serves multiple industries through its Acoustic Science and Data Science divisions, offering comprehensive solutions for high-performance computing applications across sectors including sports, entertainment, biotech, education, fintech, real estate, healthcare, and energy.</p><p>The Swiss Digital RWA Exchange partnership reflects growing institutional interest in tokenized real-world assets as blockchain technology matures and regulatory frameworks become more established.
