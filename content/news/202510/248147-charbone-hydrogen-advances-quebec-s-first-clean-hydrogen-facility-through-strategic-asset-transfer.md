<p>CHARBONE Hydrogen Corporation has completed the dismantling and transportation of hydrogen production assets from Quebec City to its Sorel-Tracy facility, marking a critical step toward commissioning Quebec's first clean ultra-high purity hydrogen production unit. The company remains on schedule for a November 2025 operational startup, with the equipment transfer representing both a logistical achievement and strategic advancement in the province's emerging hydrogen economy.</p><p>CEO Dave B. Gagnon emphasized that this milestone brings CHARBONE closer to initial clean hydrogen production in Quebec while optimizing investments through asset reuse. The successful completion of dismantling and transport operations was conducted by CHARBONE's technical teams and specialized partners, ensuring complete preservation of module and system integrity throughout the relocation process.</p><p>This development stems from a strategic transaction announced on September 5, 2025, through which CHARBONE secured hydrogen production and refueling assets. The acquisition approach not only accelerates the company's market entry but significantly reduces capital costs by utilizing already operational and proven equipment. The company plans to begin reintegration and connection work at the Sorel-Tracy site in the coming weeks.</p><p>CHARBONE's vision involves building North America's first modular clean ultra-high purity hydrogen production and distribution network. The company's progress demonstrates the tangible implementation of this strategy, with the Sorel-Tracy facility representing the initial node in what could become a distributed hydrogen production infrastructure. Additional information about the company's broader initiatives can be found at <a href="https://www.charbone.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.charbone.com</a>.</p><p>The successful equipment transfer underscores the viability of CHARBONE's asset-reuse approach to hydrogen infrastructure development. By repurposing existing equipment rather than manufacturing new components, the company achieves both cost efficiencies and accelerated deployment timelines. This methodology could serve as a model for other companies seeking to rapidly establish hydrogen production capacity while managing capital expenditure constraints.</p><p>Gagnon acknowledged the contributions of partners, suppliers, and internal teams, noting that their work quality and commitment have been instrumental in reaching this milestone. As CHARBONE moves forward with equipment reintegration at Sorel-Tracy, the company remains focused on its November production target, which would establish Quebec's first operational clean ultra-high purity hydrogen facility and potentially catalyze broader adoption of hydrogen technologies across North American industrial and transportation sectors.</p>
