<p>Runway Growth Finance Corp. has entered into a definitive merger agreement to acquire SWK Holdings Corp., a life science focused specialty finance company, in a transaction valued at approximately $220 million. The acquisition represents a strategic move to diversify and optimize Runway Growth's investment portfolio while significantly expanding its presence in the healthcare and life sciences sectors.</p><p>David Spreng, Runway Growth's Founder and CEO, stated that the transaction meaningfully advances the company's strategy to diversify and optimize its portfolio by adding SWK's high-quality investments in healthcare and life sciences. The acquisition is expected to generate mid-single-digit net investment income accretion during the first full quarter following the transaction close, while more than offsetting anticipated loan repayments previously signaled by the company.</p><p>The transaction will expand Runway Growth's balance sheet to $1.3 billion in total assets pro forma for the SWK acquisition, while enhancing the company's already strong portfolio metrics through high quality investments in attractive verticals. Healthcare investments will increase to approximately 31% of the portfolio from 14% as of June 30, 2025, representing a substantial shift in portfolio composition toward the healthcare and life sciences sector.</p><p>SWK's portfolio includes 22 companies with an approximate fair value of $242 million based on Runway Growth's estimates conducted as of August 15, 2025. The acquisition will expand Runway Growth's investment and deal sourcing teams with the addition of members from SWK's healthcare and life sciences teams, strengthening the company's capabilities in this specialized sector.</p><p>The transaction structure includes a fixed stock component expected to total $75.5 million in Runway Growth shares valued at closing NAV per share and approximately $145 million in cash. Runway Growth Capital LLC, as Runway Growth's external investment adviser, will contribute an additional $9 million in cash for distribution as consideration to SWK stockholders. The merger is structured as a net asset value-for-NAV transaction based on SWK's June 30, 2025 reported financials.</p><p>Runway Growth is pursuing growth through both organic and inorganic strategies as a permanent capital vehicle backed by the $10 billion BC Partners Credit platform. The acquisition offers Runway Growth a repeatable blueprint for future deals in the venture and growth investment ecosystem that is non-dilutive to shareholders. Additional information about the transaction is available through the <a href="https://www.runwaygrowth.com/investor-relations" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Runway Investor Relations website</a>.</p><p>SWK's Board of Directors has unanimously approved the transaction, and Carlson Capital L.P. has signed a Voting Agreement supporting the deal. The transaction is expected to close in late 2025 or the first quarter of 2026, pending SWK shareholder and regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions. This strategic acquisition positions Runway Growth as a more diversified specialty finance company with enhanced capabilities in the rapidly growing healthcare and life sciences financing market.</p>
