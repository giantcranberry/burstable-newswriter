<p>One Choice Logistics, a Florida-based aggregate transportation company operating 250 owner-operated dump trucks, dump trailers, and cement tankers across South and Central Florida, faced significant financial pressure despite achieving rapid growth to over $6 million in revenue by 2024. The company's success in winning larger contracts created cash flow constraints as accounts receivable stretched 60 to 90 days while maintaining weekly driver payments and monthly material purchases.</p><p>CEO Azohani Bernal explained the operational challenge: "We pride ourselves in paying our drivers and subs on time, every time. But the bigger contracts we won, the longer our accounts receivables stretched—anywhere from 60 to 90 days at times, putting stress on our finances." The company, founded in 2022, found its financial stability threatened by the very growth that signaled its market success.</p><p>The solution emerged through a partnership between TruckIT, the market-leading technology provider for digitizing and optimizing the bulk hauling supply chain, and Bolton Capital, a specialized financial services firm focused on dump truck haulers' needs. This collaboration addressed one of the transportation industry's most persistent challenges—cash flow management—by enabling haulers to get paid faster and take on additional work.</p><p>For One Choice Logistics, the impact was immediate and substantial. "We were carrying more than $600,000 in invoices this summer," Bernal noted. "Bolton funded $400,000 to us in 48 hours, and the remaining $200,000 the following Monday. We've had them fund our invoices every week, ever since." The integration of Bolton Capital's rapid payment capabilities with TruckIT's advanced digital e-Ticketing platform created a seamless transition from job completion to cash availability.</p><p>The technological solution operates through TruckIT's platform at https://www.truckit.com, where One Choice submits its invoices, and Bolton's ticket-matching technology ensures instant verification and payment. This partnership has transformed the company's competitive position in the Florida transportation market. Bernal emphasized the strategic advantage: "We were in a tough spot trying to keep up with the big names in our space. Bolton and TruckIT helped us change that. They are part of our team now, helping keep our drivers, subcontractors, and customers paid and happy."</p><p>Andrew Lindsay, co-founder and CEO of TruckIT, brought personal industry experience from running Astra Group to understanding dump truck owner/operators' challenges. "Through our partnership with Bolton, we can help One Choice both improve efficiency and provide the funding needed to run its business effectively and strategically," Lindsay stated.</p><p>Beyond business benefits, the financial stability provided significant personal relief for Bernal. "For six months, I was stressed out 24/7 about making payroll as well as paying our drivers and subs. I credit Bolton and TruckIT for making my life easier," he recalled. The successful implementation demonstrates how targeted financial technology partnerships can solve fundamental operational challenges in the transportation sector, particularly for rapidly growing companies facing cash flow constraints that often accompany expansion.</p>
