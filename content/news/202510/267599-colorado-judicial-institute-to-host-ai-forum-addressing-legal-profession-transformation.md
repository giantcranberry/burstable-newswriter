<p>The Colorado Judicial Institute (CJI), an independent, nonpartisan nonprofit dedicated to promoting excellence and public trust in Colorado's courts, will host a thought leadership forum addressing the influence of artificial intelligence on the legal profession. The forum, titled "AI Today: What the Legal Community Needs to Know Right Now," will take place on November 6, 2025, bringing together judges and legal experts to explore how AI is reshaping legal practice from courtroom ethics to law firm innovation.</p><p>"AI is no longer a future trend. It's here now, and it's already testing the boundaries of ethics, professionalism, and trust in our courts," said CJI Board Chair Thor Nelson. "This forum will provide Colorado's legal community with the insights needed to navigate the risks and seize the opportunities that AI presents." The event's timing reflects the legal industry's urgent need to address AI's rapid integration into legal workflows and decision-making processes.</p><p>The forum will feature three prominent legal experts addressing different aspects of AI's impact on the legal system. Hon. Lino Lipinsky of the Colorado Court of Appeals will discuss "Ethics Rules & AI: How the Colorado Rules of Professional Conduct govern attorneys' use of generative AI, with real-world cases of misuse and consequences." This session will examine the regulatory framework surrounding AI use in legal practice and provide practical guidance on compliance, addressing growing concerns about AI-generated content in legal documents and court submissions.</p><p>Hon. Maritza Dominguez Braswell from the U.S. District Court, District of Colorado will present on "AI & the Law Today: Examining AI's societal and legal impacts, including bias, accuracy, and the line between what AI can do versus what it should do." Her presentation will address critical questions about algorithmic fairness and the ethical boundaries of AI implementation in legal proceedings, particularly relevant as courts increasingly encounter AI-generated evidence and analytical tools.</p><p>Katina Banks, Esq., of Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher LLP will explore "AI in Practice: Exploring how firms are integrating AI into client service, and the frameworks needed for responsible adoption." This session will provide practical insights into how law firms are currently implementing AI technologies while maintaining professional standards and client confidentiality. The forum will be held at Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher LLP's Denver offices at 1900 Lawrence Street, with registration and networking from 4:00-5:00 p.m. followed by the forum from 5:00-6:30 p.m.</p><p>Attendees can earn 2 CLE credits (0.8 ethics, 1.2 general) for participation.
