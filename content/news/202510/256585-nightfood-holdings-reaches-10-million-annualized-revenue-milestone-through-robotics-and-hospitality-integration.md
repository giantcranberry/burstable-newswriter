<p>Nightfood Holdings Inc., trading under the symbol NGTF on the OTCQB market, has reached approximately $10 million in annualized revenue through its portfolio of robotics and hospitality assets. This financial milestone represents a substantial achievement for the company, which operates under the business name TechForce Robotics and focuses on artificial intelligence-driven automation solutions.</p><p>The revenue achievement underscores Nightfood's successful transition into a high-growth enterprise built on two core strategies: hotel acquisitions and an expanding Robotics-as-a-Service platform. According to CEO Jimmy Chan, this milestone validates the company's integrated growth model and demonstrates the effectiveness of their approach to scaling AI-driven hospitality automation. Chan emphasized that this progress supports the company's commitment to delivering long-term shareholder value through strategic expansion.</p><p>Nightfood's primary focus lies in developing and deploying AI-powered automation across various industries, with hospitality serving as its initial sector of entry. The company's Robotics-as-a-Service platform specifically targets heavy-duty, repetitive, dirty, and injury-prone tasks that have become increasingly difficult to staff with human labor. This approach addresses critical workforce challenges while improving operational efficiency in the hospitality sector.</p><p>The company's long-term vision extends beyond hospitality, with plans to expand into additional verticals requiring similar automation solutions. Nightfood aims to deliver scalable robotics that enhance safety, efficiency, and reliability across multiple sectors, positioning itself to capture market share in the rapidly expanding global service robotics industry. Industry projections indicate this market will exceed $170 billion by 2030 globally, representing significant growth potential for companies operating in this space.</p><p>As part of its vertically integrated business model, Nightfood is strengthening its financial position through ownership of asset-rich real estate. The company has begun with hotel acquisitions that serve dual purposes: generating real estate revenue while providing live deployment sites for robotics testing and operational benchmarking. This combined strategy of robotics innovation and real estate growth creates a unique competitive advantage in the automation marketplace.</p><p>Investors seeking additional information about Nightfood Holdings can access the latest news and updates through the company's dedicated newsroom at <a href="https://ibn.fm/NGTF" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://ibn.fm/NGTF</a>.
