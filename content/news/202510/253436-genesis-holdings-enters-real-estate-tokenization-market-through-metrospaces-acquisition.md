<p>Genesis Holdings, Inc. has signed a Letter of Intent with Metrospaces, Inc., marking the company's strategic entry into the real estate tokenization sector. The agreement involves Genesis acquiring Metrospaces' intellectual property assets in exchange for $1 million in Preferred Stock, convertible at a 15% discount to market and carrying a 5% annual yield. This transaction represents a significant shift for Genesis as it evolves into a next-generation PropTech and tokenization platform.</p><p>The global Security Token Offering market is projected to exceed $20 billion by 2030, growing at a compound annual rate of more than 50%. This rapid expansion reflects increasing demand from both institutional and retail investors seeking regulated digital alternatives to traditional securities. Genesis positions itself as an early entrant in a market that could fundamentally reshape real estate funding and ownership structures for decades to come.</p><p>Following the transaction's closure, Oscar Brito will be named CEO of Genesis. Brito brings over two decades of international experience in luxury and hospitality real estate, having co-founded and participated in the development of globally recognized projects such as the London Bvlgari Hotel. Throughout his career, he has been directly involved in more than $900 million in real estate funding, transactions, and dispositions across the Americas and Europe.</p><p>The acquired intellectual property will serve as the technological foundation for Genesis' upcoming tokenized real estate ecosystem. This platform is designed to enable transparent, compliant, and liquid investment structures that bridge traditional real estate with digital capital markets. Brito stated that tokenized real estate represents the next frontier of financial innovation, combining blockchain transparency, AI efficiency, and real-asset backing to create steady, scalable growth.</p><p>Genesis intends to finalize the relaunch of both MetroCrowd and MetroHouse platforms following the transaction's completion. The company plans to onboard new partners and prepare the platforms for phased rollout while introducing innovative tokenized financing models. These models are designed to align investor interests with transparent, asset-backed structures and provide a sustainable foundation for long-term value creation in the evolving real estate investment landscape.</p><p>The implications of this strategic move extend beyond Genesis Holdings' corporate evolution. For business leaders and technology investors, this development signals the maturation of real estate tokenization as a viable investment class. The combination of Brito's extensive real estate experience with Metrospaces' technological assets creates a compelling proposition in a market projected for explosive growth. The $20 billion security token offering market projection by 2030 underscores the significant opportunity for early movers in this space.</p><p>For the broader real estate industry, Genesis' entry into tokenization represents a potential paradigm shift in how properties are financed and owned. The platform's emphasis on transparency and compliance addresses key concerns that have historically limited blockchain adoption in regulated sectors. By bridging traditional real estate with digital capital markets, Genesis aims to create more accessible investment opportunities while maintaining the security and regulatory compliance expected by institutional investors.</p><p>The phased rollout of MetroCrowd and MetroHouse platforms will provide valuable insights into how tokenization can transform real estate investment structures. The success of these platforms could accelerate industry-wide adoption of blockchain technology, potentially making real estate investment more liquid, transparent, and accessible to a broader range of investors worldwide.</p>
