<p>The CRA Connector Room, a free AI-driven business matchmaking event, will launch in Flint, Michigan on October 22, 2025, offering businesses targeted professional connections designed to accelerate growth. Organized by Free Spirit Capital Ventures and Social Solace in partnership with the Michigan CRA Association, this innovative approach replaces traditional networking with precision-matched, one-on-one sessions between business owners and vetted experts.</p><p>The event utilizes a four-step matching process that begins with a brief assessment to understand each business's specific needs. Participants complete a business interest form available at <a href="https://forms.gle/exampleform123" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://forms.gle/exampleform123</a> to create a customized profile summarizing their goals and challenges. An AI algorithm then matches attendees with the most relevant professionals across critical business areas including lending, marketing, AI technology, and general consulting.</p><p>During the event, participants engage in 15-minute speed sessions with their matched experts, ensuring focused, solution-driven conversations. This strategic approach aims to deliver actionable insights tailored to specific business challenges, direct connections to lenders and service providers ready to support growth, and clear implementation steps that can be applied immediately. The event will take place at the Wyndham Garden Hotel & Conference Center in Flint from 10:00 AM to 3:00 PM, with a break for lunch and awards between 11:30 AM and 1:00 PM.</p><p>Space for the Connector Room is limited and registration operates on a first-come, first-served basis. Businesses can also schedule a 15-minute business interest or sponsorship call through <a href="https://calendly.com/examplecall" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://calendly.com/examplecall</a>.

By replacing random networking with data-driven matching, the Connector Room represents a significant evolution in how business connections are made. For business leaders, this means more efficient use of time and resources, with connections specifically tailored to address current challenges and growth opportunities. The focus on critical areas like lending, marketing, and AI technology reflects the growing importance of digital transformation and specialized expertise in today's competitive business environment.</p><p>Social Solace, one of the organizing partners, focuses on fueling scalable business growth and community revitalization through strategic investment and program management, with more details available at <a href="http://www.socialsolacex.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.socialsolacex.com</a>.
