<p>UGI Utilities, Inc. has commenced a substantial natural gas main replacement project in Lancaster and Lancaster Township, representing a major infrastructure investment focused on improving service reliability and safety for the community. The project demonstrates UGI's ongoing commitment to maintaining and upgrading its natural gas distribution network to meet current and future energy demands across its service territory.</p><p>The infrastructure work will concentrate on several critical areas including High Street between Charles Road and South Pearl Street, Euclid Avenue to St. Joseph Street, the rear parking lot of Manor Shopping Center, and intersections at Hershey Avenue and South Pearl Street with High Street. Construction operations are scheduled Monday through Friday from 7:00am to 5:00pm, with completion of the new natural gas main installation anticipated by the end of December. This timing ensures residents will benefit from the upgraded system during winter's peak heating season when energy demands are highest.</p><p>Beyond the immediate infrastructure improvements, this project creates significant opportunities for property owners along the project route to convert to natural gas service. The system upgrades make natural gas more accessible to homeowners and businesses who may have previously been unable to connect to the utility's network. This expansion potential aligns with broader energy accessibility goals while providing residents with additional heating and energy options that could lead to cost savings and improved energy efficiency.</p><p>During construction, drivers should expect lane and parking restrictions in the affected areas. The project will also require temporary interruptions to natural gas service, necessitating UGI personnel to access properties for equipment inspection and relighting procedures. Following the main installation, temporary restoration will occur immediately, with final paving scheduled for a later date. Additional information about UGI Utilities, Inc. and its services is available at <a href="https://www.ugi.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.ugi.com</a>.</p><p>The Lancaster project reflects UGI's broader mission as a natural gas and electric utility serving more than 760,000 customers across its service territory. Such infrastructure investments are crucial for maintaining the integrity and safety of energy delivery systems while supporting community development through expanded service availability. For business leaders and property owners, this infrastructure upgrade represents both immediate operational considerations during construction and long-term benefits through improved energy access and reliability.</p>
