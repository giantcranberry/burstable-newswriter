<p>Greysteel has arranged approximately $93 million in senior construction financing for horizontal infrastructure development of a large-scale master-planned residential community in Brunswick County, North Carolina. The project will deliver more than 2,000 single-family lots, with five national and regional homebuilders already under contract for lot acquisitions. This substantial financing arrangement represents approximately 81% of the total project cost, highlighting the significant capital commitment required for large-scale residential development.</p><p>The transaction was led by Greysteel Associate Landen Nix with support from Senior Director Daniel Hartnett, working with a New York-based lender to secure the financing. The complex deal involved refinancing a challenged legacy capital structure and increasing the loan size to accommodate the conversion and sale of paper lots during development. This strategic approach demonstrates how sophisticated financing structures can rescue and revitalize projects that might otherwise stall due to capital constraints.</p><p>In a competitive lending environment characterized by higher rates and increased lender selectivity, Greysteel leveraged relationships with 10 to 15 qualified land development lenders to quickly source multiple competitive term sheets. The team's strategic approach allowed the client to prioritize the time-sensitive transaction while structuring a flexible loan that could adapt to the project's evolving requirements. This successful execution underscores continued lender confidence in well-structured development projects with strong sponsorship, even as market conditions tighten.</p><p>"In a capital markets environment defined by higher rates and lender selectivity, securing flexible financing for horizontal infrastructure is paramount," said Nix, who marked his first career closing with this significant transaction. "This transaction required a forward-thinking partner, and the lender delivered with certainty of execution. Their ability to upsize the loan and structure terms around future lot sales was instrumental in recapitalizing the project and unlocking its next phase."</p><p>The financing arrangement demonstrates that despite current market challenges, well-conceived development projects continue to attract substantial capital investment. For business and technology leaders monitoring real estate and development trends, this transaction signals that strategic partnerships and flexible financing structures remain available for projects with strong fundamentals. The successful execution also highlights the importance of experienced financial intermediaries in navigating complex capital markets.
