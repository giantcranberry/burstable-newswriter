<p>UNLOCKD Inc., formerly BitFrontier Capital Holdings, has completed a comprehensive corporate restructuring and is advancing its strategy to establish a public platform for scaling high-growth consumer brands. The company formally changed its corporate name following approval by the Wyoming Secretary of State on September 29, 2025, marking the completion of its structural transformation and the beginning of its next growth phase.</p><p>During the third quarter of 2025, UNLOCKD executed what management describes as a disciplined reset that transformed the company from a distressed micro-cap issuer into a structured, investible public platform. Key achievements included the elimination of convertible debt, with legacy variable-rate notes being fully retired and restructured into fixed-rate instruments at a $0.01 per share cap. The company anticipates liability reduction exceeding 85% pending CPA review, significantly improving balance-sheet strength for future acquisition financing. Additionally, over 235 million unsupported or non-beneficial shares were invalidated, restoring capital-structure integrity.</p><p>Dr. Jordan P. Balencic, Chairman and CEO of UNLOCKD, stated that Q3 was about earning back trust through discipline by eliminating structural risk and simplifying the balance sheet. This foundation now enables the company to focus on execution during the fourth quarter of 2025. Current initiatives include finalizing a $150,000 equity seed round, completing the EVERMINDâ„¢ acquisition of a physician-formulated cognitive-health beverage platform, and securing a post-revenue synergistic brand under letter of intent.</p><p>The company is also preparing a Regulation A offering after receiving preliminary, non-binding expressions of interest totaling approximately $2 million from prospective investors. Management is prioritizing strategic investors and valuation discipline, raising only the capital needed for current execution while protecting long-term shareholder value. Each milestone reinforces the company's core principle of executing first and capitalizing later, allowing valuation growth before raising additional funds.</p><p>UNLOCKD's strategy targets consumer-health and functional-wellness products, which have demonstrated resilience across market cycles. The company's model focuses on acquiring post-proof-of-concept brands at less than one times revenue and scaling them using shared infrastructure. Most consumer packaged goods exits occur between four and ten times revenue, creating what management sees as a clear arbitrage opportunity for disciplined operators.</p><p>The timing appears favorable according to market analysis. <a href="https://www.reuters.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Reuters</a> reported in September 2025 that the Federal Reserve's rate-cut cycle is reducing the cost of capital, while private-market valuations in wellness and beverage remain 20-40 percent below 2021 peaks. Strategic acquirers are redirecting portfolios toward functional categories, creating additional tailwinds for UNLOCKD's approach.</p><p>Looking beyond immediate acquisitions, UNLOCKD is exploring innovative ownership models including tokenized-equity frameworks and profit-linked share-buyback programs. These initiatives, while exploratory and subject to regulatory review, reflect the company's forward-thinking approach to modernizing how investors, consumers, and founders participate in shared success. The company has engaged a creative agency to develop its full brand ecosystem, including a new corporate website at <a href="https://www.UNLOCKDinc.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">https://www.UNLOCKDinc.com</a> and updated communications platform scheduled to debut in Q4 2025.</p>
