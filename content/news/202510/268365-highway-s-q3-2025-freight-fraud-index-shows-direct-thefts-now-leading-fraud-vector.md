<p>The freight industry faces a significant evolution in fraud tactics as Highway's Q3 2025 Freight Fraud Index reveals direct thefts have surpassed compromised emails and ownership-change abuse as the leading fraud vector targeting freight brokers and carrier networks. This shift in criminal methodology comes even as total theft volumes trend slightly downward from the previous quarter, indicating that while overall incidents may be decreasing, the nature of the threats is becoming more sophisticated and damaging.</p><p>Rogue carriers are driving a substantial share of losses according to the comprehensive data analysis. During the third quarter alone, Highway blocked 605,728 fraudulent email attempts and identified 62,531 fraudulent phone numbers, demonstrating the scale of attempted infiltration into logistics networks. Brokers reported 2,992 identity alerts during the same period, while Highway recorded 149 unauthorized Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration contact changes, revealing persistent manipulation of carrier records that enables broader fraud operations.</p><p>The cumulative data through the first three quarters of 2025 shows Highway has blocked 1,453,129 fraudulent email attempts, already exceeding the total of 914,719 for the full year 2024. This dramatic increase highlights the escalating nature of digital threats facing the transportation sector. Michael Grace, VP of Customer Risk Management at Highway, emphasized that while bad actors are evolving their approaches, effective defenses remain rooted in fundamental security practices. Teams that consistently verify identities, confirm rate confirmations through secure channels, and maintain disciplined verification practices experience dramatically fewer incidents.</p><p>Email takeovers and phishing continue to serve as primary entry points for identity misuse, with fraud rings often blending into legitimate email threads to intercept rate confirmations, impersonate dispatchers, and redirect payments. Phone-based impersonation is also rising significantly, with spoofed or Voice over Internet Protocol numbers increasingly used to solicit load details or submit fraudulent contact changes that enable account takeover. The global nature of these operations remains evident, with the top countries associated with Q3 attempts being India, Serbia, and Pakistan. Domestically, California, Texas, and Florida saw the highest concentration of activity, with growing pressure in Indianapolis-area distribution hubs.</p><p>Industry data from FreightWaves supports these findings, reporting that in Q2, U.S cargo theft rose 33% year over year to 525 incidents, with pilferage accounting for a majority of cases. As the holiday season approaches, Highway has flagged higher risk for specific commodities including meat and seafood, frozen foods, consumer electronics, and alcoholic or specialty beverages, particularly on multi-stop routes and at high-volume consolidation points. The company recommends verifying carrier identity and contact changes with trusted sources, requiring multi-factor authentication on all email accounts, and delivering rate confirmations only through secure channels.
