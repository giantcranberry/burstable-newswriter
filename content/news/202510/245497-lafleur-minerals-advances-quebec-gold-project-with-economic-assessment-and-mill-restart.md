<p>LaFleur Minerals Inc. is advancing its gold exploration and processing operations in Quebec with plans to complete a Preliminary Economic Assessment for its drilling project by the end of October. The company's comprehensive evaluation covers its 18,304-hectare project located within the globally recognized Abitibi Greenstone Belt, a premier gold district known for significant mineral deposits.</p><p>The company has drilled 24 holes to date across its Swanson Gold Deposit site, with six holes already assayed revealing high-grade, near-surface intercepts. These initial results demonstrate strong potential for expanding shallow, open-pit mineral resources, providing encouraging data for the ongoing economic assessment. The near-surface nature of the mineralization suggests potential for cost-effective extraction methods that could enhance the project's economic viability.</p><p>Concurrent with exploration activities, LaFleur Minerals is preparing to restart operations at its Beacon Gold Mill, which represents a strategic component of the company's revenue generation strategy. The mill is expected to deliver near-term revenues through processing custom raw ore projects for neighboring gold claims while remaining available for production of the company's own gold product once exploration advances sufficiently. This dual-purpose approach provides immediate cash flow potential while maintaining flexibility for future production scaling.</p><p>The company's enhanced international visibility received a boost with its recent listing on Tradegate, expanding its exposure to European markets and potentially broadening its investor base. This increased market presence comes at a critical time as the company moves forward with both exploration and processing initiatives. All scientific and technical information has been reviewed and approved by Louis Martin, P.Geo. (OGQ), Exploration Manager and Technical Advisor, who qualifies as a Qualified Person under NI 43-101 standards.</p><p>Investors seeking additional information can access the latest news and updates through the company's dedicated newsroom at <a href="https://ibn.fm/LFLRF" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://ibn.fm/LFLRF</a>. The ongoing development of both the exploration project and milling operations represents a coordinated approach to building value through multiple revenue streams while advancing toward potential gold production from the company's own resources in one of Canada's most promising gold districts.</p>
