<p>AG5, a leading provider of skills management and compliance software, has expanded its platform to include full competency management capabilities, helping organizations bridge the critical gap between workforce skills and operational needs. The update transforms AG5's core skills matrix software into a more comprehensive solution that enables HR, training, and operations teams to map, track, and manage employee competencies in real time.</p><p>According to Rick Van Echtelt, CEO of AG5, the expansion addresses a fundamental need in modern workforce management. "Our clients are looking for more than visibility - they want control and clarity over workforce capability," Van Echtelt stated. "Adding competency management tools was the natural next step to help them link skills data directly to job roles, audits, and compliance goals." This strategic enhancement positions AG5 to better serve organizations navigating complex workforce challenges.</p><p>The newly introduced features allow companies to define role-based competencies, assess proficiency levels, and automatically identify skills gaps across teams and departments. By integrating these functions directly into AG5's existing platform, organizations can ensure that training, compliance, and resource planning are all aligned to actual workforce readiness. This integrated approach eliminates data silos and provides a unified view of organizational capability.</p><p>Competency management is increasingly recognized as a critical element of workforce planning, particularly in regulated industries like manufacturing, energy, and aviation where maintaining compliance and safety depends on clear documentation of employee qualifications and certifications. AG5's visual competency matrices enable managers to easily identify who is qualified for specific tasks, which employees require further development, and how competencies evolve over time.</p><p>The data-driven approach offered by AG5's expanded platform reduces manual tracking, streamlines audit processes, and supports continuous improvement initiatives. "Our goal is to make competency management something every team can act on daily - not just during audits or reviews," Van Echtelt added. "This release brings us closer to that vision." The platform's real-time capabilities mean organizations can respond more quickly to changing operational requirements and compliance standards.</p><p>With this expansion, AG5 reinforces its position as a trusted partner for companies seeking more innovative and transparent ways to manage workforce skills, training, and compliance.
