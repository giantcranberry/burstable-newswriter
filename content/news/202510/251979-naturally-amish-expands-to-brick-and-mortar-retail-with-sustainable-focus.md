<p>Naturally Amish, a growing leader in eco-conscious lifestyle products, will open its first brick-and-mortar retail location in Angola, Indiana in November 2025. The 4,000-square-foot store at 3096 West Maumee Street will feature sustainable home goods, home-brewed coffee, Amish products and ethically made beef products, marking the company's transition from startup to experiential retail presence.</p><p>This expansion represents a significant step in bringing sustainable living options to the Midwest region. We wanted to bring sustainability to life, said Noah Wagler, Co-Founder and CEO of Naturally Amish. This store is more than just a place to shop - it's a community hub where customers can learn about eco-friendly living and discover everyday products that reduce environmental impact.</p><p>The company has already secured a second location scheduled to open in Spring 2026 to accommodate brand growth. The Angola location serves as both a travel stop for interstate traffic and a gateway to the community, featuring innovative environmental technologies, hands-on product demos, and locally sourced decor from the Amish community.</p><p>To celebrate the opening, Naturally Amish will host a launch event including product giveaways, sustainability workshops, and in-person meet and greets. The company plans to donate 10% of launch weekend proceeds to Dove's Nest Unlimited, a nonprofit supporting environmental education in Indiana.</p><p>Simulated Environment Concepts, Inc. (SMEV) has been engaged in multiple negotiations and has issued Letters of Intent and Non-Disclosure Agreements while securing two physical sites to manage daily operations for Naturally Amish. The company is collaborating on broadening the vision for Naturally Amish and ultimately SMEV, as discussed in a recent 30-minute podcast available at <a href="https://www.wlki.com/blog.php?article=133466" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.wlki.com/blog.php?article=133466</a>.</p><p>Future technological innovations under consideration include beef production, life-changing feed, seed, manure, water and conservation innovations. Due to my faith and community involvement, I felt compelled to share the current developments surrounding the growth of the Naturally Amish brand, stated Wagler, who also serves as CEO/President of SMEV. Although we are still in the initial phases of negotiating several deals with multiple companies, I believe it is crucial to inform our investors about the potential rapid changes that may occur.</p><p>The company will provide updates through official channels including <a href="https://x.com/SMEVCO" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://x.com/SMEVCO</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/61581078278480" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.facebook.com/61581078278480</a> as agreements are finalized. The expansion reflects growing consumer interest in sustainable and ethically produced goods, particularly in regions traditionally underserved by eco-conscious retail options.</p>
