<p>Angkor Resources Corp. has confirmed plans to drill multiple exploratory oil and gas wells in Cambodia during 2026, potentially marking the nation's first onshore hydrocarbon resource development. The company's progress represents a significant milestone for Cambodia's energy sector and could position the Southeast Asian nation as an emerging player in regional energy markets.</p><p>The company's subsidiary EnerCam Resources completed approximately 350-line kilometres of 2-D seismic across Block VIII in southwest Cambodia by September 2025, with ongoing processing revealing substantial geological structures. CEO Delayne Weeks stated the company remains confident and motivated with the interpretations of the data to date, despite awaiting results from additional seismic lines. The seismic interpretation has identified at least three significant closed anticlines in both the South Bokor and Central Bokor sections, with one structure in Central Bokor potentially larger than currently imaged due to limited seismic coverage in that sub-basin area.</p><p>Technical advisor Dr. David Johnson described the findings as extremely exciting and well founded, noting the rare discovery of anticlines with four-way closures measuring over 48 square kilometres and 60 square kilometres respectively in a large sedimentary basin showing indications of a working hydrocarbon system. Johnson emphasized that these structures present themselves clearly and are unmistakable in both the seismic line data and also in the surrounding surface geology. Evidence supporting the potential hydrocarbon system includes multiple legacy and newly discovered surface live oil seeps located within each sub-basin and adjacent areas.</p><p>The seismic data reveals a potential thick ribbon-like top seal consistent with mudstone deposition, along with underlying sections showing characteristics of potential reservoir-bearing formations. Johnson estimated the rock volume of a single one-meter thickness reservoir zone under proven closure at 48 million and 60 million cubic meters respectively for the identified structures. The company has identified what geophysicists refer to as Direct Hydrocarbon Indicators and notes the potential for multiple layers of reservoir strata.</p><p>Management is currently advancing activities including sourcing suitable drilling equipment and ancillary services to bring into Cambodia. The team is also working to improve signal-to-noise data over processed seismic lines to develop a stronger understanding of Block VIII's potential. Additional seismic interpretation continues, with work focused on better understanding the hydrocarbon system and reducing risks associated with reservoir quality, seal integrity and source quality. Angkor Resources maintains that drilling remains the only method to prove Cambodia's first onshore oil and gas resource, with the 2026 exploratory program representing a significant step in the nation's energy development.

Successful development could transform Cambodia's energy independence, create new supply chains in Southeast Asia, and establish the nation as a participant in global energy markets. The technical validation of substantial geological structures with proven hydrocarbon indicators suggests this development warrants close observation by energy sector investors and regional policymakers alike.</p>
