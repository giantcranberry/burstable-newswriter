<p>UGI Utilities, Inc. will begin natural gas main replacement projects in Lancaster starting Monday, October 13, as part of the company's ongoing commitment to maintaining safe and reliable service infrastructure. The system upgrades represent a substantial investment in the community's energy delivery network while offering conversion opportunities for properties along the designated route.</p><p>The underground construction work will focus on several key areas including South Lime Street between East Vine Street and Howard Avenue, Howard Avenue at South Lime Street, Seymour Street between Fairview Avenue and South Prince Street, Fairview Avenue between 138 Alley and Seymour Street, South Prince Street Intersection at Seymour Street, and the 700 Block of South Prince Street. Construction activities are scheduled Monday through Friday from 7:00am to 5:00pm, with completion of the new natural gas mains expected by the end of October.</p><p>Residents and businesses should anticipate temporary disruptions including road closures, detours, and parking restrictions during the construction period. Natural gas service interruptions will occur as part of the upgrade process, requiring UGI personnel to access properties for equipment inspection and relighting procedures. The company has emphasized that temporary restoration of affected areas will follow immediately after underground work completion, with final paving scheduled for a later date.</p><p>These infrastructure improvements align with UGI's broader mission to enhance service reliability across its customer base. Additional information about UGI Utilities, Inc. and its operations is available at <a href="https://www.ugi.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.ugi.com</a>. The Lancaster project represents the latest in UGI's systematic approach to maintaining and modernizing energy delivery systems that serve more than 760,000 customers throughout its service territory.</p><p>The timing of these upgrades provides strategic benefits for the community as colder weather approaches, ensuring that the natural gas distribution system meets increased seasonal demand. For properties currently using alternative energy sources, the construction period offers a convenient window for conversion to natural gas service, though the company has established separate communication channels for conversion inquiries rather than incorporating them into the construction coordination process.</p>
