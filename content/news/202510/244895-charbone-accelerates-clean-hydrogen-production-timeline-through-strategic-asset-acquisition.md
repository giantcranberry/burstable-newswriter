<p>CHARBONE Hydrogen Corporation has officially taken possession of hydrogen production and refuelling assets from Harnois Energies Inc., marking a significant step in accelerating the company's clean ultra high purity hydrogen production timeline. This strategic transaction will enable CHARBONE to rapidly relocate and repurpose proven hydrogen production equipment at its flagship Sorel-Tracy facility, allowing for the first production of clean UHP hydrogen by early Q4 2025.</p><p>The acquisition represents a pivotal moment for CHARBONE's development strategy, as utilizing proven, already operational assets is expected to significantly reduce capital installation costs and accelerate time-to-market compared to deploying new systems.

This equity-based transaction preserves capital for CHARBONE's growth initiatives while strengthening the partnership between the two energy companies.</p><p>Dave B. Gagnon, CEO of CHARBONE, described the acquisition as a transformative moment for the company, stating that with these assets, CHARBONE will begin producing clean UHP hydrogen in Sorel-Tracy much sooner than anticipated while optimizing capital efficiency. The transaction positions CHARBONE to advance its goal of building North America's first clean UHP hydrogen production and distribution network.</p><p>The accelerated production timeline at Sorel-Tracy comes at a critical moment in the transition to low-carbon energy solutions. By leveraging existing infrastructure and proven technology, CHARBONE demonstrates a practical approach to scaling hydrogen production capacity while managing financial risk.
