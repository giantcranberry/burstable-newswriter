<p>Element Fleet Management has introduced a new modular trade show exhibit system that showcases its refreshed brand identity while adapting to various event formats. The custom-designed 20×20 exhibit, developed by Adler Display, can be reconfigured into 10×20 and 10×10 booth configurations while maintaining consistent visual impact and brand recognition. This flexibility addresses the challenge of presenting a cohesive brand experience across different trade show footprints while optimizing visibility and engagement opportunities.</p><p>The exhibit incorporates several innovative components designed for both functionality and visual appeal. A 12-foot diameter overhead hanging sign with two-sided graphics ensures visibility from all angles, while a 12-foot tall modular storage closet combines secure storage with backlit branding elements. Two double-sided backlit light boxes serve dual purposes, equipped with mounts for presentation monitors to highlight Element Fleet's services and solutions to potential clients.</p><p>Technology integration represents a significant aspect of the exhibit's design strategy. A custom branded Genius Bar features four wireless charging pads and a 36-inch bistro-height wireless charging table with adjustable LED perimeter halo lighting. These elements create a technology-friendly environment that encourages visitor interaction and extended engagement. The curved reception counter includes recessed LED perimeter lighting, internal shelving, and locking doors, blending aesthetic appeal with practical functionality.</p><p>Adler Display provided comprehensive project support extending beyond design and fabrication, including exhibit property storage and maintenance through their online inventory system available at https://adlerdisplay.com/inventory. The turnkey approach encompassed complete logistics and vendor coordination, enabling Element Fleet's team to concentrate on client engagement rather than booth management. This service model ensures the exhibit remains in optimal condition between events and streamlines planning for future trade show appearances.</p><p>The modular system represents a strategic investment in Element Fleet's marketing infrastructure, offering a flexible solution that adapts to various event requirements while preserving the visual identity established during the company's recent brand refresh. The combination of bold graphics, interactive technology, and thoughtful space planning positions the company to make a strong impression in competitive trade show environments. The exhibit's design emphasizes both form and function, creating an inviting space that facilitates meaningful connections with prospects and clients while showcasing Element Fleet's modern brand identity.</p>
