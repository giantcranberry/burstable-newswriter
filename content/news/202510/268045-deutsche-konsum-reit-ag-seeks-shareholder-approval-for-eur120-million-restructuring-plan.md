<p>Deutsche Konsum REIT-AG will hold an Extraordinary General Meeting on December 4, 2025, in Berlin where shareholders will vote on a restructuring capital increase that forms the cornerstone of the company's recovery strategy. The restructuring concept, developed in collaboration with FTI-Andersch AG and presented on September 1, 2025, represents a pivotal moment for the real estate investment trust as it navigates current market challenges while maintaining its strategic focus on retail properties serving essential consumer needs.</p><p>The planned capital increase will be executed as a mixed cash and contribution in kind offering with subscription rights, with receivables from registered and convertible bonds totaling approximately €120 million to be contributed as contribution in kind. This substantial financial restructuring marks a critical step for the company's recovery efforts and future stability, providing the necessary capital infusion to strengthen its position in the German retail property market.</p><p>The Federal Financial Supervisory Authority has granted a crucial exemption from the obligation to publish and submit a mandatory takeover offer under the German Securities Acquisition and Takeover Act. This regulatory clearance applies specifically in the event that Versorgungsanstalt des Bundes und der Lander or its affiliated companies gain control of the company as part of the restructuring capital increase. The exemption facilitates the financial reorganization by eliminating potential takeover requirements that could complicate the restructuring process.</p><p>Deutsche Konsum REIT-AG maintains its focus on German retail properties for everyday goods at established micro-locations, with the company's primary strategy centered on acquiring, managing, and developing local supply properties to achieve consistent performance and leverage hidden reserves. The company's shares are listed on the Prime Standard of the Deutsche Borse and maintain a secondary listing on the JSE. This restructuring initiative comes at a crucial juncture for the real estate sector, particularly for companies specializing in retail properties that serve essential consumer needs amid evolving market conditions.</p><p>The successful implementation of this restructuring plan could have significant implications for the broader German real estate investment trust sector, potentially setting precedents for how companies facing financial challenges can navigate regulatory requirements while maintaining operational focus. For industry leaders and investors, the outcome of this shareholder vote will provide valuable insights into the viability of complex financial restructuring in the current economic environment and the regulatory flexibility available for companies undertaking substantial reorganization efforts.</p>
