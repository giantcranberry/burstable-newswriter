<p>LaFleur Minerals Inc. is advancing development of approximately 18,304 hectares at the Swanson Gold Project in Quebec's Abitibi Gold Belt, with initial investigations and nearby gold recovery indicating strong potential. The company benefits from extensive historical data including results from over 36,000 metres of drilling conducted on the property, providing a substantial foundation for resource development and future mining operations.</p><p>The company's strategic position is significantly enhanced by its fully permitted and recently refurbished Beacon Gold Mill, an asset valued at over C$71 million replacement cost that LaFleur acquired through bankruptcy proceedings for a fraction of its value. The mill had received more than C$20 million in equipment and other upgrades by the previous owner before LaFleur's purchase, representing a major capital advantage in an industry where processing infrastructure typically requires massive investment.</p><p>With gold prices reaching elevated levels in recent months, the Beacon Gold Mill represents a significant opportunity for both LaFleur and regional mining operations. The 100%-owned facility is capable of processing over 750 metric tons per day once an estimated C$5 million in restart upgrades are completed, highlighting the relatively low restart cost compared to the asset's substantial value. This positions LaFleur to capitalize on favorable gold market conditions with minimal additional capital expenditure.</p><p>The Swanson Gold Project encompasses several prospects rich in gold and critical metals previously held by Monarch Mining, Abcourt Mines, and Globex Mining. LaFleur has consolidated a large land package along a major structural break that hosts the Swanson, Bartec, and Jolin gold deposits along with several other showings. The project's accessibility by road provides direct access to multiple nearby gold mills, further supporting its development potential and reducing logistical challenges typically associated with remote mining operations.</p><p>LaFleur is considering using the Beacon Gold Mill for processing mineralized material from its Swanson Project as well as for custom milling operations serving other nearby gold projects. This positions the company as a valuable conduit for regional deposits seeking to enter production quickly without the capital expenditure required for building processing facilities. The latest news and updates relating to LFLRF are available in the company's newsroom at <a href="https://ibn.fm/LFLRF" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://ibn.fm/LFLRF</a>.</p><p>The company's district-scale development approach in the prolific Abitibi Gold Belt near Val-d'Or, Qu√©bec combines the resource-stage Swanson Gold Project with the operational-ready Beacon Gold Mill, creating a comprehensive gold development platform with multiple pathways to production and revenue generation. This integrated strategy could significantly reduce the typical timeline from exploration to production while providing multiple revenue streams through both proprietary mining operations and third-party custom milling services.</p>
