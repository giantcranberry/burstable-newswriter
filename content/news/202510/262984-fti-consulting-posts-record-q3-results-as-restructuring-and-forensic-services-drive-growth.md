<p>FTI Consulting delivered record third-quarter results with revenue increasing 3.3% to $956.2 million and earnings per share climbing 41% to $2.60, driven by one-time items that management described as favorably tilted. The company raised its full-year guidance as strength in Corporate Finance & Restructuring and Forensic & Litigation Consulting offset continued weakness in Economic Consulting and Technology segments. Adjusted EBITDA increased to $130.6 million, representing 13.7% of revenue compared to 11.1% a year earlier, signaling improved operational efficiency across the consulting firm's diverse service offerings.</p><p>The Corporate Finance & Restructuring segment led the performance with revenue up 18.6% to $404.9 million, driven by increased demand for restructuring services and deal advisory work. The segment demonstrated strong operational efficiency with its EBITDA margin expanding to 23.8%. Forensic & Litigation Consulting followed with 15.4% revenue growth to $194.7 million, as stronger pricing in risk and investigations and data analytics services pushed margins to 21.9%. Strategic Communications grew 7.4% to $89.4 million, reflecting sustained demand for crisis management, transformation, and cybersecurity counsel services.</p><p>The results highlight shifting demand patterns within the consulting industry, where corporate restructuring and forensic services are showing resilience while traditional economic consulting faces significant headwinds. Economic Consulting, dominated by Compass Lexecon, experienced a 22% decline to $173.1 million and posted a $4.6 million adjusted EBITDA loss amid softer antitrust work and higher retention and hiring costs. Management indicated that costs have stabilized but cautioned that a revenue inflection will require multiple quarters as new hires ramp up their productivity.</p><p>Technology segment revenue declined 14.8% to $94.1 million due to fewer second-request matters, though activity showed sequential improvement from previous quarters. Chief Executive Steve Gunby characterized the quarter's performance as validation of years of organic investment and strategic talent acquisitions across geographies and service adjacencies. He reaffirmed the company's commitment to continued spending on AI capabilities and senior recruiting despite near-term pressure in weaker segments, signaling confidence in long-term growth prospects.</p><p>FTI Consulting now expects 2025 revenue of $3.685 billion to $3.735 billion, with EPS projected between $7.62 and $8.12 and adjusted EPS ranging from $8.20 to $8.70, assuming a 22% to 24% tax rate. The company demonstrated strong capital allocation discipline, repurchasing 1.426 million shares during the quarter at an average price of $164.18 and an additional 469,610 shares post-quarter at $160.23. The board further strengthened shareholder returns by adding $500 million to the share buyback authorization, reflecting confidence in the company's financial position and future outlook. The company maintained solid liquidity with cash standing at $146 million against net debt of $364 million.</p><p>Management acknowledged typical fourth-quarter seasonality but projected that 2025 would mark the 11th consecutive year of adjusted EPS growth barring unforeseen market disruptions. The results underscore how diversified consulting firms are navigating economic uncertainty by leveraging their broad service portfolios, with restructuring and forensic work providing stability while other segments work through cyclical challenges. The performance suggests that companies facing economic headwinds are increasingly turning to specialized consulting services for restructuring guidance and litigation support, creating opportunities for firms with deep expertise in these areas.</p>
