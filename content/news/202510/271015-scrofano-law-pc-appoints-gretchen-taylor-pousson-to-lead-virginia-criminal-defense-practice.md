<p>Scrofano Law PC has appointed Gretchen Taylor Pousson as head of its Virginia Criminal Defense Practice, leveraging her three decades of trial experience and distinctive background spanning both prosecution and defense work. Based in Fairfax, Virginia, Attorney Pousson represents clients in state and federal courts across Northern Virginia, providing what the firm describes as powerful, compassionate advocacy for individuals facing criminal charges.</p><p>Pousson's legal career began as an Assistant Public Defender in Roanoke, Virginia, where she tried her first murder case just six months after passing the bar examination. She later served five years as a prosecutor in Newport News, gaining what she describes as critical insight into prosecution strategies and priorities. This dual perspective has informed her approach to criminal defense throughout her career. In an interview with <a href="https://www.superlawyers.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Super Lawyers Magazine</a>, she reflected on her philosophy, stating, "Sometimes justice means you let someone go or you give them a chance for redemption."</p><p>Her understanding of the criminal justice system deepened during seven years as an Assistant Federal Public Defender in the Eastern District of Virginia, where she handled some of the region's most serious federal cases. During this period, she developed a reputation as a fearless, ethical advocate for her clients facing complex legal challenges.</p><p>After establishing her own practice in 2008 and incorporating Taylor Law Company in 2011, Pousson joined Scrofano Law PC in August 2023 to establish and oversee the firm's Fairfax office. Her current practice encompasses representing clients charged with criminal offenses while also handling expungements, firearm rights restoration, and protective order defense matters.</p><p>Joseph A. Scrofano, founder and principal attorney of the firm, emphasized Pousson's alignment with the firm's values, stating, "Gretchen embodies everything we value at Scrofano Lawâ€”relentless advocacy, compassion, and a deep belief in redemption. Her leadership in Virginia strengthens our firm's commitment to defending the rights of the accused with skill and integrity."</p><p>Beyond her courtroom work, Pousson has presented on criminal law and trial advocacy topics before national defense organizations. Her professional recognition includes being named a Super Lawyer and AVVO Top Attorney, honors that acknowledge her courtroom excellence and personal dedication to clients. As a Founding Member of the <a href="https://www.duidefense.org" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">DUI Defense Lawyers Association</a>, her case experience spans from DUI and theft to serious felony and homicide charges, including unique animal defense matters where she successfully exonerated dogs wrongfully labeled as dangerous.</p><p>Former clients have described Pousson as "honorable, ethical, and kind," with one noting she "drastically altered the course of my life simply by doing her job." Her appointment represents Scrofano Law PC's strategic expansion throughout Virginia, building on the firm's existing presence in Washington, D.C., and Rockville, Maryland.</p>
