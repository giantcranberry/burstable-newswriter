<p>The Dog Stop will open its new Oviedo, Florida location on October 18 at 1370 Oviedo Mall Blvd, bringing comprehensive dog care services to Orlando's growing pet community. The 10,000-square-foot facility will offer luxury boarding accommodations, interactive daycare, expert training, spa-like grooming, and premium retail products, positioning it as a full-service destination for local dog owners.</p><p>Justin Steiner, owner of the Oviedo location, brings significant business credentials to the pet care industry as a Vanderbilt Business School valedictorian and former consultant. Steiner transitioned to pet care after experiencing what he described as an increasingly corporate-focused environment in his previous career. His personal experience with rescued greyhounds and a negative incident at another boarding facility shaped his commitment to safety and quality standards in pet care.</p><p>Steiner emphasized his philosophy that pets are family members deserving of exceptional care. I've always been inspired by the unique bond between humans and dogs, and the true partnership that has evolved between us over time, said Steiner. I believe that pets are part of the family, and I saw that same philosophy reflected in The Dog Stop. The facility will be managed by Shaun Philbrook, whose 15-year career with the Winter Springs Police Department included serving as a K9 officer and holding leadership positions. Philbrook's expertise in canine behavior, psychology, and physiology, combined with his deep community roots as a Winter Springs High School graduate and UCF alumnus, positions him to deliver the high standard of care local pet owners expect.</p><p>Beyond providing premium services, Steiner plans significant community engagement initiatives and intends to grow to five locations in the region. He is actively seeking partnerships with rescue organizations to host adoption events in the facility's large lobby area. The grand opening celebration on October 25 will feature Halloween-themed activities including a dog costume contest and giveaways.

Justin embodies everything we look for in a The Dog Stop owner, said Coslov. His passion and love for dogs will ensure he provides the high standard of care we are committed to. The Dog Stop, founded in 2009 and franchising since 2013, operates 39 locations across 15 states with over 50 additional locations planned. The company emphasizes staying current with evolving science in dog care, behavior, grooming, and nutrition.</p><p>The expansion reflects broader trends in the pet care industry, where premium services and comprehensive facilities are increasingly meeting consumer demand for high-quality pet care. For business leaders, this demonstrates how experienced professionals from corporate backgrounds are bringing sophisticated business practices to traditionally fragmented service industries, potentially raising industry standards and creating new investment opportunities in the growing pet care market.</p>
