<p>Floor Coverings International signed 30 franchise agreements during the third quarter of 2025, including 15 agreements in August alone, marking what company President and CEO Tom Wood described as a historic milestone. The company has reached 70 signed agreements year-to-date and remains on track to achieve its goal of 100 new agreements by the end of 2025. This expansion comes as the flooring industry is projected to maintain a 2.4% annual growth rate over the next four years, driven by consistent demand from both residential and commercial sectors.</p><p>The company's expansion strategy includes both resales in existing markets and entry into new territories, with August alone bringing expansion into eight new territories and seven resales. Wood emphasized that resales strengthen existing markets while bringing new entrepreneurs with fresh energy and vision to the organization. This dual approach allows the company to deepen its presence in established markets while simultaneously expanding its geographic footprint across North America.</p><p>The franchise opportunity offers relatively low investment costs compared to other business ventures, with total investment for two territories ranging from $257,000 to $467,000. According to the company's Franchise Disclosure Document, the top 50 percent of operators generated $1.75 million in average revenue in 2024, while the top 10 percent grossed $3.3 million. The company seeks entrepreneurs with what it describes as an empire builder mindset who are committed to continuous learning and thinking in multi-million dollar terms.</p><p>Floor Coverings International distinguishes itself in the flooring category through its Mobile Flooring Showrooms, data-driven performance systems, and comprehensive support infrastructure. The company currently operates more than 250 locations throughout the United States and Canada, with significant room for continued expansion. Additional information about the franchise opportunity is available at <a href="https://flooring-franchise.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://flooring-franchise.com/</a> while customers can find their nearest location through <a href="https://www.floorcoveringsinternational.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.floorcoveringsinternational.com/</a>.</p><p>The company's growth trajectory reflects broader trends in the home services industry, where flooring represents an accessible entry point with strong profit margins. As Floor Coverings International continues to expand its national footprint, the brand aims to establish deeper roots in communities across North America while maintaining its position as the leading flooring franchise in the region. This expansion signals continued investor confidence in the home improvement sector despite broader economic uncertainties, positioning the company to capitalize on sustained demand for flooring services across both residential and commercial markets.</p>
