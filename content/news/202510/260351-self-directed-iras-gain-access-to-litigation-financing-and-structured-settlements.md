<p>Self-directed IRA owners now have access to two alternative investment opportunities within the legal sector: litigation financing and structured settlements, according to recent guidance from Next Generation Trust Company. These investments represent different approaches to generating passive income through retirement accounts, with litigation financing offering high-risk, high-reward potential while structured settlements provide more stable, predictable returns.</p><p>Litigation financing represents a growing trend in alternative asset investing where self-directed IRA owners provide non-recourse cash advances to fund legal cases. As Jaime Raskulinecz, founder and CEO of Next Generation, explained, "This is a passive investment and as a non-recourse transaction, the investor only makes money if the case is successful." The investment supports plaintiffs or law firms in exchange for a portion of the final settlement, with returns typically based on a percentage of damages or a multiple of the initial investment.</p><p>The risk profile for litigation financing is relatively high since investors only receive returns if cases are successful, but this is balanced by potential for substantial returns. Investors can participate through various channels including funding groups, online platforms, or hedge funds specializing in litigation financing. More information about SDIRAs and the many alternative assets these plans allow is available at <a href="https://www.NextGenerationTrust.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.NextGenerationTrust.com</a>.</p><p>Structured settlements offer a more conservative alternative, where investors can purchase the rights to future payments from legal settlements at discounted rates. When plaintiffs receive court-ordered compensation spread over multiple years, they sometimes opt to sell these future income streams for immediate lump sum payments. Self-directed IRA owners can then acquire these payment rights at less than their total value, creating steady passive income as payments continue according to the original schedule.</p><p>Unlike litigation financing, structured settlements involve minimal risk since payment schedules are established by courts and typically administered by insurance companies. The SDIRA receives income greater than the initial investment amount while benefiting from the predictable payment structure. Both investment types demonstrate the flexibility of self-directed retirement plans in accessing non-traditional assets that can diversify retirement portfolios beyond conventional stocks and bonds.</p><p>The growing interest in these alternative investments reflects broader trends in retirement planning as investors seek diversified income streams and exposure to specialized market segments.
