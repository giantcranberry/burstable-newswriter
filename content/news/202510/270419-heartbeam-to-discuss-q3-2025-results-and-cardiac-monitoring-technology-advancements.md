<p>HeartBeam Inc. has scheduled a conference call for Thursday, November 13, 2025, at 4:30 p.m. ET to review the company's third quarter 2025 financial results and provide business updates. The medical technology company will discuss results for the period ended September 30, 2025, along with regulatory progress, commercial-readiness activities, and upcoming milestones. This conference call represents an important opportunity for stakeholders to understand HeartBeam's progress in commercializing technology that could redefine cardiac health management.</p><p>The company is developing innovative cardiac monitoring technology that represents a significant advancement in portable heart health management. HeartBeam is creating the first-ever cable-free device capable of collecting ECG signals in 3D from three non-coplanar directions and synthesizing these signals into a 12-lead ECG. This platform technology is designed for portable devices that can be used wherever the patient is located, delivering actionable heart intelligence directly to physicians. The company's focus on creating portable, cable-free ECG monitoring solutions addresses significant gaps in current cardiac care delivery, particularly for patients requiring ongoing monitoring outside clinical settings.</p><p>HeartBeam's technology has already achieved important regulatory milestones, with its 3D ECG technology receiving FDA clearance for arrhythmia assessment in December 2024. The company's 12-Lead ECG synthesis software remains under FDA review, representing a critical next step in bringing comprehensive cardiac monitoring capabilities to patients outside traditional medical facilities. Additional information about the company's progress can be found in their <a href="https://ibn.fm/BEAT" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">newsroom</a>.</p><p>The implications of HeartBeam's technology extend beyond immediate patient care to potentially transform how cardiac conditions are detected and monitored globally. Physicians using this technology will be able to identify cardiac health trends and acute conditions while directing patients to appropriate care entirely outside medical facilities. This capability could significantly improve access to cardiac monitoring for patients in remote areas or those with limited mobility. HeartBeam's intellectual property portfolio includes over 20 issued patents related to technology enablement, providing substantial protection for its innovative approach to cardiac monitoring.</p><p>The company will issue a detailed press release with specific financial results and operational updates prior to the November conference call. Investors and interested parties can access the full initial announcement at <a href="https://ibn.fm/5mXsb" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://ibn.fm/5mXsb</a> for additional background information. The development of portable, comprehensive cardiac monitoring technology represents a significant advancement in healthcare accessibility and could fundamentally change how cardiac conditions are managed in outpatient settings worldwide.</p>
