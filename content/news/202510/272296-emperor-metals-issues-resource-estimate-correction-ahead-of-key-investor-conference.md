<p>Emperor Metals Inc. announced its participation in the 2025 New Orleans Investment Conference scheduled for November 2-5 at the Hilton New Orleans Riverside, where the company will present progress across its Quebec gold portfolio including the Duquesne West and Lac Pelletier projects. The Canadian mineral exploration company simultaneously issued a significant clarification regarding resource estimate figures disclosed in its October 30, 2025 news release.</p><p>The company corrected previous statements about its Duquesne West project, confirming that the updated combined open-pit and underground Inferred Mineral Resource Estimate totals 1.46 million ounces of gold at an average grade of 1.69 g/t Au. This represents an increase of over 100% from the historical resource, but clarifies that earlier references to 5.42 g/t Au or 104% increase were inaccurate. Emperor Metals apologized for any confusion caused by the misstated figures and reaffirmed its commitment to transparent communication with shareholders and stakeholders.</p><p>The resource clarification comes at a critical time as the company prepares to showcase its Quebec gold portfolio to investors at the prestigious New Orleans Investment Conference. The Duquesne West Gold Project and Lac Pelletier Project, both situated in Quebec's Southern Abitibi Greenstone Belt, represent significant exploration opportunities in one of Canada's most prolific mining districts. The company utilizes AI-driven exploration techniques to unlock the substantial resource potential of these properties.</p><p>The timing of this clarification underscores the importance of accurate resource reporting in the mining sector, particularly as junior exploration companies seek to attract investment capital. The corrected figures maintain the project's significant resource growth narrative while ensuring stakeholders receive precise technical information. The company's leadership team, described as resource sector professionals with strong records of success, faces the dual challenge of advancing exploration projects while maintaining investor confidence through transparent disclosure practices.</p><p>For additional information about the company's activities and corporate profile, investors can refer to regulatory filings available through <a href="https://www.sedarplus.ca" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.sedarplus.ca</a>.
