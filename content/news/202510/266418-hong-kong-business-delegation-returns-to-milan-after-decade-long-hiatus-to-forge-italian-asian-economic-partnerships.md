<p>The Hong Kong Trade Development Council will host its 13th Think Business, Think Hong Kong promotion campaign at Palazzo Mezzanotte in Milan on November 27, marking the event's return to Italy since 2014. This strategic initiative addresses evolving global dynamics and emerging growth markets including the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, ASEAN nations, and Hong Kong's Northern Metropolis development, presenting Italian businesses with critical pathways into Asian markets.</p><p>Approximately 80 representatives from Hong Kong, including government officials, business leaders, innovators, and entrepreneurs will participate in the day-long event focused on dialogue, networking, and partnership development. The program features remarks from HKTDC Chairman Prof Frederick Ma, Hong Kong SAR Government representatives, and Italian government officials. High-profile speakers include Hans Michael Jebsen, Chairman of The Hong Kong-Europe Business Council; Bernard Chan, Chairman of West Kowloon Cultural District Authority; Bonnie Chan, CEO of Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited; Claudio de Bedin, Partner of Justin Chow & de Bedin Solicitors LLP; and Alex Zhavoronkov, Founder and CEO of Insilico Medicine.</p><p>The event structure includes four thematic sessions addressing key collaboration areas between Hong Kong and Italy. The Finance and Trade session will examine global economic trends, Hong Kong's role as a trade hub, digital trade initiatives, and plans for trade corridors connecting Italy, Hong Kong, and the Chinese Mainland. Innovation and Technology discussions will explore artificial intelligence developments, greentech solutions, industrial digitalization, and smart city applications. Supply Chain Service sessions will highlight corporate treasury centers' strategic role in strengthening supply chain functions within Asia's dynamic markets. Creative and Design forums will promote collaboration between Hong Kong and Italian design, lifestyle, manufacturing, fashion, art, and luxury sectors.</p><p>Italy maintains significant economic ties with Hong Kong, with bilateral trade reaching US$8.3 billion in 2024, making Italy Hong Kong's fourth-largest trading partner in the EU. Italy ranked as the third-largest EU investor in Hong Kong at the end of 2023, while Hong Kong served as the third most popular Asian destination for Italian investment. Approximately 200 Italian companies currently operate in Hong Kong across dynamic sectors including fashion, luxury goods, electronics, food and beverage, and professional services.</p><p>Hong Kong's business ecosystem offers competitive taxation, a robust common law legal framework, strong intellectual property protection, and privileged access to Chinese Mainland and Asia-Pacific markets. This combination positions Hong Kong as an ideal platform for Italian companies seeking international expansion and market diversification in one of the world's most vibrant economic regions.
