<p>UGI Utilities, Inc. will commence a natural gas main replacement project in Manheim Borough starting October 2, 2025, as part of the company's ongoing commitment to maintaining safe and reliable energy infrastructure. The system upgrades represent a significant investment in the community's energy delivery network while creating opportunities for additional properties to connect to natural gas service.</p><p>The construction will focus on several key streets throughout the borough, including North Grant Street between West Colebrook Street and West High Street, West Gramby Street between North Grant Street and North Clay Street, North Clay Street between West Colebrook Street and West Gramby Street, and West Chestnut Street between North Graham Alley and North Grant Street. These upgrades are designed to replace aging infrastructure with modern piping systems that enhance safety and service reliability for existing customers.</p><p>Work schedules are planned for Monday through Friday from 7:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., with the project expected to cause temporary disruptions to the community. Residents and business owners should anticipate road closures, detours, and parking restrictions throughout the construction period. The project will also require temporary interruptions to natural gas service, necessitating UGI technicians to access properties for equipment inspection and relighting procedures.</p><p>Beyond infrastructure improvements, this project presents a unique opportunity for properties along the construction route that currently lack natural gas service to convert to this energy source. The installation of new mains creates the infrastructure needed to support additional customer connections, potentially expanding natural gas availability to more homes and businesses in the area. Additional information about UGI Utilities, Inc. and its services is available at <a href="https://www.ugi.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.ugi.com</a>.</p><p>Following the installation of new natural gas mains, UGI will perform temporary restoration of affected areas, with final paving operations scheduled for completion at a later date. This phased approach minimizes long-term disruption while ensuring proper installation and testing of the new infrastructure. The project reflects UGI's broader commitment to maintaining and upgrading energy delivery systems across its service territory, which includes more than 760,000 customers throughout the region.</p><p>The system upgrades align with industry standards for maintaining safe and efficient natural gas distribution networks while supporting community energy needs. Property owners affected by the construction are encouraged to plan for potential disruptions and coordinate with UGI as needed throughout the project timeline.</p>
