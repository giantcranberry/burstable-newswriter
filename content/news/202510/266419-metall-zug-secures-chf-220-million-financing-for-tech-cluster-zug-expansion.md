<p>Metall Zug has finalized a syndicated loan agreement for CHF 220 million with an increase option of CHF 50 million to support the continued development of Tech Cluster Zug. The financing arrangement, secured with a consortium of banks led by ZÃ¼rcher Kantonalbank, will fund the cluster's expansion over the next four years with a one-year extension option. This substantial financial backing addresses the Metall Zug Group's increasing financing requirements resulting from the cluster's ongoing expansion.</p><p>The loan facility serves dual purposes: refinancing existing bank loans and securing financing for upcoming real estate projects. The credit is secured by a mortgage featuring an agreed maximum loan-to-value ratio of 45%. Multiple real estate projects on the Tech Cluster Zug site have demonstrated significant progress throughout the current year, highlighting the strategic importance of this financing arrangement for the cluster's development trajectory.</p><p>The SHL project represents a major milestone in the cluster's evolution, with the building shell scheduled for completion by the end of 2025. Handover of the combined production and office building is planned for mid-2026, demonstrating the viability of industrial production in an urban context directly adjacent to V-ZUG. The long-term lease agreement associated with this project ensures stable cash flows for the development, providing financial predictability for future phases.</p><p>Another significant development, the CreaTower I project, has received its building permit with groundbreaking already completed. Building shell completion is scheduled for 2028, featuring innovative RFS ceilings that offer substantial environmental benefits. These specialized ceilings have significantly less mass compared to conventional ceiling systems, resulting in approximately 46% reduction in CO2 emissions. The planned sale of the building to VZ Depository Bank in 2028 is expected to generate an appreciation gain, as the associated land is recorded at historical acquisition costs.</p><p>Project Pi forms a core element in the sustainable development vision for Tech Cluster Zug, focusing on creating affordable housing in central Zug within walking distance of the tech cluster. The project emphasizes attractive and innovative high-rise living within vertical communities, with architecture precisely tailored to the location. Despite an administrative complaint filed in March 2025, Tech Cluster maintains its commitment to Project Pi and the GIBZ development plan, underscoring the long-term strategic importance of this mixed-use development approach.</p><p>The financing arrangement and project progress demonstrate Metall Zug's ongoing investment in transforming Tech Cluster Zug into a comprehensive ecosystem that integrates industrial production, commercial space, and residential living. This approach represents a modern urban development model that balances economic growth with environmental considerations and community needs.
