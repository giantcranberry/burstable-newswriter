<p>Brian Gleason, recently appointed Chief Executive Officer of Seedtag, is steering the global leader in neuro-contextual advertising through significant expansion across CTV and the open web. Gleason brings decades of experience from previous leadership roles at Criteo, GroupM, and Xaxis, positioning him to guide Seedtag's mission to redefine digital advertising through its proprietary AI platform, Liz.</p><p>What drew Gleason to Seedtag was the company's consistent scaling ability and the opportunity to redefine advertising by making it more human, sustainable, and effective. He explained that neuro-contextual advertising represents an evolution beyond traditional contextual methods, combining neuroscience principles with advanced embeddings to understand content in a human-like way. Our neuro-contextual AI, Liz, is able to understand everything on a page or screen—text, images, video, even emotional cues—while always respecting user privacy, Gleason noted.</p><p>Seedtag's technology goes beyond traditional contextual awareness by understanding users' interests, intentions, and emotions in real time, delivering meaningful impact across the full funnel from awareness to action. The company recently reported 120% year-over-year growth in North America and successful expansion into new markets like Australia and Canada. This momentum stems from both technological strength and trust built with brands and agencies, according to Gleason.</p><p>Looking ahead, one of the biggest opportunities is in CTV, where contextual advertising remains an evolving space. Seedtag's CTV offering brings the same depth of contextual intelligence that the company has built on the open web into the streaming environment. Liz analyzes content using natural language processing, computer vision, and sentiment analysis, breaking it down into over 11,000 categories and recognizing 600+ objects and 300 situational contexts in video content.</p><p>The company's approach to privacy-first, context-based advertising directly addresses industry concerns around data privacy and the decline of third-party cookies. Privacy is built into every part of our offering, Gleason emphasized. By focusing on the interests, intentions, and emotions of users, rather than their personal data, we help advertisers succeed in a privacy-first world without compromising performance.</p><p>Seedtag's AI Intention Models distinguish between casual browsing and transactional readiness, allowing brands to avoid wasting spending on low-intent impressions and focus investment where consumers are most likely to act. A leading automotive client in Spain achieved a Cost per Quality Visit 68% below target and a Cost per Lead 35% below the goal using this intention-based targeting approach.</p><p>As the organization grows rapidly and expands into new regions, maintaining innovation and company culture remains crucial. Gleason stressed the importance of remembering Seedtag's Madrid origins while ensuring consistency across markets with local adaptations. The most important thing is that everyone understands where we are going and the problems we are trying to solve, he said.</p><p>For the next 12-18 months, Seedtag's top strategic priorities include continuing to scale while advancing privacy-first advertising through neuro-contextual strategies powered by Liz. The company aims to help brands better understand and connect with consumers by translating emotions and context into measurable outcomes, while expanding adoption across key markets and advancing their CTV offering.</p>
