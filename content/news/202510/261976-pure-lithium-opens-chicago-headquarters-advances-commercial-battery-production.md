<p>Pure Lithium Corp officially opened its new headquarters in Chicago's Fulton Market district with a ribbon cutting ceremony attended by community and business leaders. The opening represents a significant milestone in the company's transition from pure research and development to scaling up for commercial production. Pure Lithium will build a pilot production line to advance its vertically integrated Brine to Battery technology at the 21,000-square-foot facility at 400 N. Aberdeen St.</p><p>Pure Lithium Founder, Chairman and CEO Emilie Bodoin stated that after four and a half years of research and development and building up a portfolio of more than 128 patents and patent applications, the company is now focused on rapidly growing the business and moving from the lab to market. The company's relocation from Boston to Chicago represents a significant investment, bringing 50 new jobs to the region according to Lisa Clemmons-Stott, Senior Economic Advisor from the Illinois Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity.</p><p>In July, the Illinois Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity awarded Pure Lithium an incentive package with a total estimated value of $8.5 million, including a Reimaging Electric Vehicles agreement that accounts for $4.4 million. The <a href="https://www.illinois.gov/rev" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">REV program</a> provides competitive incentives for manufacturers across EV and renewables sectors to expand in or move to Illinois.</p><p>U.S. Senator Tammy Duckworth emphasized the broader implications of domestic renewable manufacturing, noting that supporting domestic renewable manufacturing benefits everyone by creating jobs, strengthening national security and building a more sustainable world. She welcomed Pure Lithium to Chicago and their work manufacturing what the state claims will be Illinois's first commercially viable lithium metal battery, helping grow Illinois's leadership in clean energy.</p><p>Pure Lithium is advancing toward production of what it claims will be the world's first commercially viable lithium metal battery, with plans to target multiple markets including drone and defense, grid-scale energy storage, consumer electronics, and electric vehicles. The company's patented Brine to Battery technology combines lithium metal extraction and battery anode production, potentially streamlining battery manufacturing processes. Pure Lithium asserts its lithium metal batteries represent a significant advancement in energy storage, offering double the energy density of current lithium-ion batteries.</p><p>Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson highlighted the strategic advantages of the location, noting the city's world class workforce, renowned universities and proximity to national labs that provide unmatched access to logistics, infrastructure, top engineering talent, and a diverse business community that allows companies to grow and to create more opportunities to scale production and reach global markets. Illinois State Senator Lakesia Collins described the development as a tremendous addition to the business landscape and a real foundation for growth and security for generations to come.</p>
