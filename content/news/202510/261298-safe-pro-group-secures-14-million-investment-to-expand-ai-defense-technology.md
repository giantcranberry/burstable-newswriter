<p>Safe Pro Group Inc. has completed a $14 million strategic investment led by Ondas Holdings Inc., marking a significant expansion of the company's artificial intelligence defense portfolio. The financing follows earlier investments by Ondas and Unusual Machines and will accelerate deployment of Safe Pro's SPOTD systems across defense and humanitarian applications. This investment represents a strong endorsement of Safe Pro's technology roadmap and its potential applications across global defense and security markets.</p><p>The company recently launched its SPOTD NODE following successful field evaluations in Ukraine. This technology enables high-resolution 2D and 3D mapping without requiring internet connectivity, addressing critical operational needs in remote or compromised environments. On October 20, 2025, Safe Pro demonstrated its SpotlightAI OnSite and NODE technologies to multiple U.S. military departments, achieving key commercialization milestones that position the company for broader adoption within defense sectors.</p><p>Safe Pro is advancing integration of its AI systems with suppliers in the U.S. Army's Short Range Reconnaissance Program. The technology is designed to help identify more than 150 explosive threat types in real time, significantly enhancing situational awareness for soldiers and allies worldwide. The company's scalable platform, built on a cloud-based ecosystem and powered by <a href="https://aws.amazon.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Amazon Web Services</a>, targets multiple markets including commercial, government, law enforcement and humanitarian sectors.</p><p>The investment comes at a time when defense organizations globally are increasingly adopting AI-powered solutions for threat detection and situational awareness. Safe Pro's technology leverages commercially available off-the-shelf drones with proprietary machine learning and computer vision technology to enable rapid identification of explosives threats. This approach provides a safer and more efficient alternative to traditional human-based analysis methods, potentially reducing risk to military personnel and civilians in conflict zones. Additional information about Safe Pro Group is available through the company's newsroom at <a href="https://ibn.fm/SPAI" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://ibn.fm/SPAI</a>.</p><p>For defense and security leaders, this development signals the accelerating convergence of commercial AI technologies with military applications. The ability to detect multiple explosive threats in real-time using existing drone platforms represents a significant advancement in force protection capabilities. The humanitarian applications also demonstrate how defense technologies can be adapted for civilian protection in conflict zones, potentially saving countless lives through improved threat identification and neutralization.</p>
