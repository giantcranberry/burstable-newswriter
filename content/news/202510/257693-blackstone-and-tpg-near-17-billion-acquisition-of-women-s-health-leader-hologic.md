<p>Private equity firms Blackstone and TPG are nearing an agreement to acquire Hologic, the manufacturer of diagnostic and medical imaging equipment for women's health, in a deal that could value the company at more than $17 billion including debt. According to people familiar with the matter, the firms are finalizing terms that would price Hologic shares at more than $75 apiece, representing a premium to recent trading levels that reflects strong investor appetite for healthcare assets with recurring revenue streams.</p><p>A formal announcement could come within days, though negotiations remain fluid and could still fall apart. If completed, the transaction would rank among the largest leveraged buyouts in the healthcare sector in recent years, underscoring private equity's renewed confidence in the market for medical technology and diagnostics after a period of rising borrowing costs and subdued dealmaking. This development follows earlier reports from <a href="https://9fin.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">9fin</a> about a $9 billion financing package being assembled by Blackstone and TPG to fund the acquisition.</p><p>The potential buyout represents a significant shift for Hologic, which has spent the past decade transforming itself from a cyclical imaging business into a diversified provider of diagnostic products and lab instruments, including widely used cancer screening tests. The Massachusetts-based company has been a steady performer in the post-pandemic diagnostics market, benefiting from its reputation for high-margin products and reliable cash flow.</p><p>Market reaction to the news has been positive, with Hologic shares rising roughly 2% on Friday and climbing an additional 6% in after-hours trading following initial reports of the potential deal. The acquisition would extend a busy year for both private equity firms, with Blackstone stepping up its push into healthcare platforms and TPG seeking opportunities in diagnostics and biotech services.</p><p>For both firms, Hologic represents an appealing mix of stable cash generation and technological innovation in women's health, an area seen as resilient to broader economic swings. While a final agreement has not been reached and both sides continue to discuss valuation, financing, and governance terms, the talks suggest that private equity's appetite for large-scale healthcare deals is once again gathering pace after a period of market uncertainty. The potential acquisition signals growing investor confidence in healthcare technology companies with proven revenue models and positions women's health diagnostics as a particularly attractive segment for future investment and consolidation.</p>
