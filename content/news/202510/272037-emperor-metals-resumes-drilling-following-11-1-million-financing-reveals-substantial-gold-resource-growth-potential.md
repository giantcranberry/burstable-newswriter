<p>Emperor Metals Inc. has resumed drilling operations at its Duquesne West and Lac Pelletier Gold Deposits following the successful closing of an $11.1 million financing round. The company recently released its Maiden Mineral Resource Estimate update, revealing substantial untapped potential at both properties. CEO John Florek emphasized that the new funding will drive accelerated exploration and development activities across the company's Quebec-based projects.</p><p>The Duquesne West Gold Project presents particularly significant expansion opportunities, with Florek noting that only about 15-20% of the drilling needed to fully delineate the deposit above 1,000 meters has been completed. This leaves substantial room for resource growth and further discovery. The deposit contains multiple high-grade gold zones within a broader bulk-tonnage envelope, offering both near-surface and deeper mining potential.</p><p>According to the company's resource assessment, the Duquesne West deposit hosts 1.46 million ounces of gold, with 44% of this resource considered amenable to open-pit extraction methods. The remaining portion of the resource is suitable for underground development, providing operational flexibility and potential for staged mine development. This dual extraction approach could optimize production economics while minimizing environmental impact.</p><p>The Lac Pelletier Project, currently under purchase agreement, represents another key asset in Emperor Metals' portfolio. Both projects are situated in Quebec's Southern Abitibi Greenstone Belt, one of the world's most prolific gold mining districts. The company utilizes AI-driven exploration techniques to enhance discovery efficiency and target generation, positioning it at the forefront of modern mineral exploration methodologies.</p><p>For detailed corporate information and regulatory filings, investors can refer to <a href="https://www.sedarplus.ca" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">SEDAR+</a> under the company's profile.

The full press release containing comprehensive details about the drilling resumption and financing can be accessed at <a href="https://ibn.fm/6Y2x5" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://ibn.fm/6Y2x5</a>.</p><p>The timing of this drilling campaign coincides with renewed investor interest in gold exploration assets, particularly in established mining jurisdictions like Quebec. The combination of advanced exploration technology, experienced leadership, and substantial untested ground positions Emperor Metals to potentially deliver significant value creation through systematic exploration and resource expansion. The company's focus on high-grade gold targets within known mineralized systems reduces geological risk while maintaining discovery upside.</p>
