<p>Quantum BioPharma Ltd. has established October 27, 2025 as the record date for the distribution of contingent value rights to holders of its Class B Subordinate Voting Shares. The distribution will occur on a one-for-one basis, with each CVR entitling holders to a pro rata portion of between 10% and 50% of any net proceeds ultimately recovered from the company's ongoing litigation against CIBC World Markets, RBC Dominion Securities, and others.</p><p>The litigation seeks damages exceeding USD $700 million, representing a significant potential financial recovery for the biopharmaceutical company and its shareholders. The CVRs are structured as non-transferable instruments that carry no interest or voting rights, and they will only become redeemable for cash if Qualifying Net Proceeds are received through either settlement or a final, non-appealable judgment in the company's favor.</p><p>This distribution mechanism provides shareholders with direct exposure to the potential upside of the litigation outcome while maintaining their existing equity positions in the company. The contingent nature of the rights means shareholders will only benefit if the company successfully recovers funds through its legal actions against the financial institutions named in the lawsuit. Additional information about the company and this announcement can be found in the full press release available at <a href="https://ibn.fm/P9Wrt" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://ibn.fm/P9Wrt</a>.</p><p>The establishment of a specific record date provides clarity to current shareholders regarding their eligibility to receive the CVR distribution. This structured approach to sharing potential litigation proceeds represents an innovative method for aligning shareholder interests with the company's legal strategy while maintaining transparency about the contingent nature of the potential financial recovery. Investors seeking ongoing updates about Quantum BioPharma can access the company's newsroom at <a href="https://ibn.fm/QNTM" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://ibn.fm/QNTM</a>.</p><p>For business leaders and technology investors, this announcement demonstrates how companies are developing creative financial instruments to manage litigation risk while preserving shareholder value. The contingent value rights structure allows Quantum BioPharma to maintain its operational focus while providing shareholders with potential upside from legal proceedings. This approach could become more common as companies seek ways to monetize legal claims without disrupting core business operations.</p><p>The potential $700 million recovery represents a substantial financial opportunity for both the company and its shareholders. Successful litigation could significantly strengthen Quantum BioPharma's balance sheet and provide additional capital for research and development initiatives. However, the contingent nature of the rights means investors must carefully assess the likelihood of successful litigation outcomes when evaluating the company's overall investment potential.</p>
