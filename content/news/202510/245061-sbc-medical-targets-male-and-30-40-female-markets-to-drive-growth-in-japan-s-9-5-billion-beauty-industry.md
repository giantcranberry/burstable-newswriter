<p>SBC Medical Group Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ: SBC), operator of Japan's largest beauty clinic chain with 259 locations, is targeting male customers and women between 30-40 for its next phase of growth, citing substantial market underpenetration in these segments. The company estimates it currently holds only 9% market share among the more than 40 million males it could potentially serve and just 8% penetration among the nearly 25 million women aged 30-40 who could use its services.</p><p>Japan's cosmetic surgery market, currently valued at approximately $3.5 billion, is projected to reach $9.5 billion by 2033, growing at a compound annual growth rate of 12.11%. This growth is driven by increasing demand for aesthetic treatments, hair removal services, and non-surgical procedures that offer natural-looking enhancements with minimal downtime. SBC Medical, which served over 6 million customers last year and maintains a customer repeat rate exceeding 70%, holds approximately 25% market share in Japan's cosmetic surgery clinic market overall.</p><p>The company's expansion strategy involves transforming its operations to better serve these underpenetrated demographics. For the male market spanning teens to 60s, SBC Medical is leveraging hair transplants and laser treatments through its 11 company-owned clinics and 22 locations operating under the Gorilla Clinic brand. The company has introduced Folix, a popular hair growth laser treatment from the U.S., positioning itself as the only provider of its scale in Japan to offer this technology.</p><p>To reach women aged 30-40, who demonstrate strong interest in anti-aging and dermatology services, SBC Medical has been overhauling its pricing structure and accelerating its shift from general surgery to specialized dermatology. This strategic pivot responds to rising demand for non-surgical treatments while improving profitability through high-efficiency, low-cost operations. The company maintains a multi-brand strategy to address diverse customer needs across different market segments.</p><p>Recent acquisitions support this growth initiative, including the purchase of Aesthetic Healthcare Holdings Pte, a network of medical and aesthetic clinics, and JUN CLINIC, which offers customized treatments. The company also launched the SBC NEO Skin Clinic brand in April 2025, designed to make aesthetic treatment more accessible and affordable, and plans to open Hada no Aozora Clinic in Tokyo this October, integrating insurance-covered dermatology with private-pay aesthetic treatments.</p><p>With $152 million in cash and cash equivalents as of June, SBC Medical has significant resources to pursue additional acquisitions. Lighthouse Capital projects the company will deploy additional capital toward acquiring smaller med spas and aesthetic clinic groups in Japan and internationally, supported by a robust balance sheet and projected cash flow positivity. The company holds over 200 patents in cosmetics and employs more than 1,000 licensed doctors across its franchised clinics, providing advanced regenerative therapies and treatments throughout Japan.</p>
