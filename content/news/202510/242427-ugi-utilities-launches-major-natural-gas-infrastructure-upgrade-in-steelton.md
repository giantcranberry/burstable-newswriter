<p>UGI Utilities, Inc. has launched a significant natural gas main replacement initiative affecting numerous streets throughout Steelton, representing a substantial infrastructure investment in the community's energy delivery system. The project demonstrates UGI's ongoing commitment to providing safe and reliable natural gas service while creating opportunities for additional homes and businesses to convert to natural gas service along the construction route.</p><p>The extensive construction work spans multiple locations including South 4th Street between Q Street and E Avenue, D Avenue at South 4th Street, and S Street between South 4th Street and 3rd Alley. Additional affected areas include 3rd Alley between S Street and Bridge Avenue, E Avenue at South 4th Street, R Street between South 4th Street and 5th Alley, and 5th Alley at R Street. The project scope also covers Felton Street heading south to South 3rd Street, South 3rd Street between Felton Street and McKinley Street, Heagy Street between South 3rd Street and 3rd Alley, and 3rd Alley between Heagy Street and Felton Street.</p><p>Construction operations are scheduled Monday through Friday from 7:00am to 5:00pm, with completion of the new natural gas main installation expected by the end of December. The project timeline includes temporary restoration immediately following underground work completion, with final paving scheduled for a later date. Residents and business owners should anticipate potential road closures, detours, and parking restrictions throughout the construction period.</p><p>The infrastructure improvements will require some temporary interruptions to natural gas service, necessitating UGI personnel to access properties for equipment inspection and relighting procedures. This comprehensive upgrade project not only enhances the safety and reliability of the natural gas distribution system but also expands access to natural gas service for properties along the construction route. Additional information about UGI Utilities, Inc. and its services is available at <a href="https://www.ugi.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.ugi.com</a>.</p><p>For properties located along the project path, this infrastructure investment presents an opportunity to transition to natural gas service, potentially offering economic and environmental benefits compared to alternative energy sources. The systematic replacement of aging infrastructure represents a critical component of maintaining community energy security and supporting future economic development in the Steelton area. This type of infrastructure modernization has broader implications for energy reliability and economic growth patterns in similar communities undergoing energy system upgrades.</p>
