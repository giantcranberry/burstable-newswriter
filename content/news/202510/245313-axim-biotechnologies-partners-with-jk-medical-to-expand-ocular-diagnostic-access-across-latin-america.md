<p>AXIM Biotechnologies, Inc. has established an exclusive license and distribution partnership with JK Medical, Inc. covering seven Latin American markets: Brazil, Chile, Peru, Argentina, Mexico, Ecuador, and Colombia. The agreement grants JK Medical rights to market and distribute AXIM's TearScan® Lactoferrin Diagnostic Test for aqueous-deficient Dry Eye Disease diagnosis and the TearScan® IgE Diagnostic Test for allergic conjunctivitis assessment throughout the covered territory.</p><p>The collaboration merges AXIM's innovative lateral-flow diagnostic technology with JK Medical's regional commercialization expertise to accelerate adoption of point-of-care ocular testing across Latin America. This strategic partnership addresses substantial unmet diagnostic needs in a region where tens of millions suffer from ocular conditions. Dry Eye Disease affects approximately 350 million people globally, creating urgent demand for improved diagnostic solutions throughout Latin American healthcare systems.</p><p>Catalina Valencia, CEO of AXIM Biotechnologies, characterized the partnership as a significant advancement in expanding access to rapid, clinic-friendly ocular diagnostics across Latin America. The combination of AXIM's TearScan® portfolio with JK Medical's established market presence will provide eye-care professionals with objective biomarkers that complement clinical evaluations for Dry Eye Disease and ocular allergy diagnosis. Juan Carlos Torres, CEO of JK Medical, Inc., noted that Latin American healthcare providers are actively seeking in-office tools that can streamline diagnosis and inform treatment decisions for dry eye and allergic conjunctivitis cases.</p><p>The agreement provides JK Medical with exclusive marketing and distribution rights for TearScan® tests across the seven countries for a four-year exclusivity period beginning once regulatory approval is secured in two of the seven nations, with Chile being the exception where commercialization can proceed immediately. JK Medical will lead distribution, education, and implementation efforts, while AXIM will supply products and provide training and technical support. Both companies will collaborate on country-specific regulatory registrations and compliance requirements.</p><p>The TearScan® diagnostic portfolio addresses critical challenges in ocular disease differentiation. Clinicians frequently struggle to distinguish between aqueous-deficient Dry Eye Disease, characterized by insufficient tear production from lacrimal glands, and evaporative Dry Eye Disease, where tears evaporate too rapidly due to meibomian gland dysfunction. Visual inspection alone presents significant limitations for dry eye diagnosis, as external signs cannot determine whether the underlying cause involves gland dysfunction, inadequate tear production, or combined factors.</p><p>AXIM's diagnostic methodology enables clinicians to test Lactoferrin levels to identify aqueous-deficient Dry Eye Disease when levels fall below normal ranges. If Lactoferrin levels appear normal, clinicians can then test IgE levels for allergic conjunctivitis assessment. When both tests return normal results, the dry eye condition likely stems from evaporative Dry Eye Disease, prompting additional targeted evaluation. Since each condition requires distinct treatment approaches, rapid point-of-care diagnostic tools become essential for accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment selection. These cost-effective, rapid tests provide clinicians with efficient tools to diagnose aqueous-deficient Dry Eye Disease and allergic conjunctivitis promptly, conserving valuable clinical time while delivering patients faster, more precise diagnostic outcomes.
