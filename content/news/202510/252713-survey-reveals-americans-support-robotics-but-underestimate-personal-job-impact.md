<p>The Pittsburgh Robotics Network's 2025 AI & Robotics Sentiment Survey reveals a nation cautiously optimistic about robotics and artificial intelligence, yet largely disconnected from how these technologies might transform their own employment situations. While Americans express strong support for robotics in specific applications and domestic manufacturing, only 12% believe their own jobs face displacement from AI advancement.</p><p>Jennifer Apicella, Executive Director of the Pittsburgh Robotics Network, noted the significance of this perception gap. "This survey shows that Americans see the benefits of robotics but don't always connect them to their own careers," Apicella said. "That's a tremendous opportunity. If industry and training partners work together, we can close this perception gap with clear upskilling pathways and a confident workforce that embraces the technology."</p><p>The survey findings indicate Americans are nearly evenly divided on whether robotics and AI will represent a net positive or negative for society overall. However, specific areas show stronger optimism, with 44% expecting increased manufacturing to return to the United States and 62% expressing preference for domestically produced robotics. These pro-U.S. manufacturing sentiments suggest potential economic benefits for American robotics companies and manufacturing sectors.</p><p>Respondents demonstrated particular enthusiasm for robotics applications in hazardous environments, natural disaster response, and space exploration. Meanwhile, concerns emerged around uses in self-driving cars, military applications, and law enforcement contexts. This selective acceptance pattern indicates public support varies significantly based on application context and perceived societal benefit.</p><p>The disconnect between general concerns and personal risk assessment represents a critical finding. While job loss ranked among top public concerns regarding AI development, the minimal percentage expecting personal impact suggests many Americans may underestimate the need for career adaptation. This perception gap could have significant implications for workforce development and retraining initiatives.</p><p>Economic perspectives also showed division, with 53% believing robotics could exert downward pressure on household incomes. However, those with higher education levels and incomes were more likely to anticipate personal benefits from robotics advancement, suggesting socioeconomic factors influence how individuals perceive technological change.</p><p>Regional initiatives are addressing these challenges through targeted workforce development. "Pittsburgh and Allegheny County are building a model for inclusive growth in advanced manufacturing and robotics, and the insights from this report are critical to that mission," said Lauren Connelly, Director of Allegheny County Economic Development. "By expanding apprenticeships, short-cycle training, and career navigation, we are ensuring residents are ready for the quality jobs this sector is creating."</p><p>The survey methodology included nationally representative online surveys of 642 American adults on robotics and 669 on AI, conducted in March 2025. Additional state-level surveys in Pennsylvania provided regional insights.
