<p>Scrofano Law PC has expanded its Virginia practice with the addition of Matthew Kensky, a respected Northern Virginia criminal and traffic defense attorney with more than two decades of courtroom experience. Known among legal colleagues as "The Professor" for his mastery of Virginia criminal case law, Kensky brings deep trial experience, appellate advocacy skills, and a reputation for clear, compassionate client communication to the firm.</p><p>Kensky began his legal career in 1999 at the Fairfax County Public Defender's Office, where he represented thousands of clients and advanced to Senior Assistant Public Defender. His subsequent experience includes serving as criminal and traffic defense attorney at a boutique Fairfax firm, handling cases across multiple Northern Virginia jurisdictions including Loudoun, Prince William, Arlington, Alexandria, Fairfax, Stafford, and Shenandoah counties. Beyond extensive trial work, Kensky has argued appeals before the Court of Appeals of Virginia, the Supreme Court of Virginia, and in matters involving Virginia administrative agencies.</p><p>Before joining Scrofano Law PC, Kensky operated his own solo practice for four years, representing hundreds of clients in District and Circuit Courts throughout Northern Virginia.
