<p>MAX Power Mining has selected a premier Saskatchewan-based drilling contractor to execute Canada's first dedicated deep well targeting natural hydrogen at the Lawson target within the 200-km-long Genesis Trend. The drilling operation, scheduled to begin on or about November 7, 2025 pending receipt of the Lawson well license, represents a pioneering effort in Canada's emerging natural hydrogen sector.</p><p>The operation will utilize a powerful tele-double rig with a 24-person crew working two 12-hour shifts over approximately three weeks. CEO Mansoor Jan described the collaboration as a major milestone and emphasized the company's goal to pursue the world's first commercial natural hydrogen discovery with what he termed a best-in-class team. Jan characterized the development as a big moment for shareholders, underscoring the significance of this venture in the competitive energy exploration landscape.</p><p>MAX Power has established itself as a first mover in the rapidly growing natural hydrogen sector, having built a dominant district-scale land position with approximately 1.3 million acres of permits covering prime exploration ground prospective for large volume accumulations of natural hydrogen. The company has identified high priority initial drill target areas for commencement of drilling in the fourth quarter of 2025, positioning itself at the forefront of this emerging energy resource exploration.</p><p>Beyond its natural hydrogen initiatives, MAX Power maintains a portfolio of properties in the United States and Canada focused on critical minerals. These properties include a 2024 diamond drilling discovery at the Willcox Playa Lithium Project in southeast Arizona, demonstrating the company's broader commitment to North America's shift toward decarbonization. Additional information about the company's operations and projects can be found at <a href="https://www.maxpowermining.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.maxpowermining.com/</a>.</p><p>The selection of the drilling contractor comes at a time when global interest in natural hydrogen as a clean energy source is accelerating. Unlike conventional hydrogen production methods that require significant energy input, natural hydrogen occurs geologically and could potentially provide a more sustainable alternative if commercially viable deposits can be identified and extracted. This drilling initiative represents Canada's entry into what many energy analysts consider a potentially transformative sector within the broader clean energy transition.</p>
