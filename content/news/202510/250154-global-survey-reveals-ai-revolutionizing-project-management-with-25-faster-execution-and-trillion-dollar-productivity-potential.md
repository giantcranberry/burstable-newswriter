<p>The 2025 Global AI in Project Management Survey reveals that artificial intelligence is fundamentally transforming how organizations deliver projects worldwide, marking the emergence of what researchers call the Transformation Age. Conducted by Prof. Antonio Nieto-Rodriguez and Dr. Ricardo Viana Vargas, the comprehensive study gathered insights from 870 professionals across 97 countries, indicating that AI-powered projects are becoming the foundation of organizational and societal progress.</p><p>AI adoption in project management is accelerating at a remarkable pace, with over 60% of professionals now using or experimenting with AI tools. More than half of organizations have integrated AI into their project delivery processes, demonstrating a significant shift from theoretical potential to practical implementation. The impact of this adoption is substantial, with early adopters reporting up to 25% faster project execution and measurable improvements in forecasting accuracy, resource management efficiency, and risk reduction capabilities.</p><p>According to Prof. Antonio Nieto-Rodriguez, author of the upcoming Powered by Projects: Leading Your Organization in the Transformation Age, the future of work is increasingly project-driven and AI-powered. He emphasizes that AI should not be used merely to cut costs but to unlock human creativity and enable more meaningful, value-creating work. This perspective challenges traditional approaches to automation and highlights the transformative potential of AI when properly integrated into project workflows.</p><p>Dr. Ricardo Viana Vargas, author of Project Management Next Generation: The Pillars for Organizational Excellence, adds that AI will not replace project managers but rather empower them to lead transformation and drive measurable results. This finding addresses common concerns about job displacement and positions AI as a tool for enhancing human capabilities rather than replacing them. The full research findings are available in the white paper accessible at <a href="https://get.pmairevolution.com/report-2025" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://get.pmairevolution.com/report-2025</a>.</p><p>The scale of this transformation is particularly significant given the enormous financial stakes involved. With $48 trillion invested in projects globally each year, even modest efficiency gains could generate trillions of dollars in additional value. This represents one of the largest potential productivity improvements in modern business history, affecting industries ranging from construction and technology to healthcare and infrastructure development.</p><p>The study also identifies a notable shift in adoption barriers. Cultural resistance and lack of trust have now overtaken technical barriers as the primary obstacles to AI implementation in project management. This finding underscores that successful transformation depends as much on people and organizational culture as on technological capabilities. Organizations must address these human factors to fully realize the benefits of AI-driven project management.</p><p>Beyond productivity improvements, the research suggests AI is redefining leadership approaches, work methodologies, and organizational transformation strategies. The integration of AI tools is enabling project teams to handle greater complexity, make more informed decisions, and deliver outcomes that were previously unattainable through traditional methods alone. This evolution represents a fundamental shift in how organizations approach change management and strategic execution across global business landscapes.</p>
