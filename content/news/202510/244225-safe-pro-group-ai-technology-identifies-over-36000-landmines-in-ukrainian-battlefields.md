<p>Safe Pro Group Inc. has reported that its artificial intelligence algorithms have identified more than 36,000 landmines and explosive objects after analyzing over 2 million drone images covering 22,500 acres of Ukrainian battlefields. The company's AI-powered security and situational awareness solutions are transforming how explosive threats are detected in conflict zones through advanced image processing technology.</p><p>The detection system operates through a crowd-sourced model that aggregates data from military, commercial, and humanitarian drone operators. This collaborative approach allows Safe Pro's AI to process massive amounts of aerial imagery and convert it into shareable 2D and 3D maps for real-time threat identification. The technology provides a safer and more efficient alternative to traditional human-based analysis methods for detecting explosive hazards.</p><p>The significance of this achievement extends beyond the immediate humanitarian impact in Ukraine. Safe Pro's technology recently earned selection for the U.S. Army's 2026 Concept Focused Warfighter Experiment, indicating military recognition of its potential applications. The company is expanding its battlefield and disaster-zone capabilities through strategic partnerships with several technology firms including Red Cat Holdings, Ondas Holdings, and Unusual Machines.</p><p>Safe Pro Group's platform represents a convergence of multiple advanced technologies. Built on a cloud-based ecosystem powered by Amazon Web Services, the scalable system leverages proprietary machine learning and computer vision technology to process imagery from commercially available off-the-shelf drones. Through platforms like SPOTD, the company provides advanced situational awareness tools that serve defense, humanitarian, and homeland security applications globally.</p><p>The company's mission-driven approach targets multiple markets where its Safe Pro AI software, Safe-Pro USA protective gear, and Airborne Response drone-based services can work synergistically to enhance safety and operational efficiency. The detection of 36,000 landmines demonstrates the practical application of AI technology in addressing real-world security challenges while reducing risks to human personnel.
