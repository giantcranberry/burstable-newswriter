<p>United States Antimony Corporation has secured approximately $25 million in gross proceeds through a securities purchase agreement with a leading long-only mutual fund, marking the company's third significant capital raise in recent weeks. This latest funding brings total institutional investment to $69.25 million over the past 45 days, with all three funding tranches occurring at progressively higher share prices according to Chairman and CEO Gary C. Evans. The consistent upward pricing trend during these successive rounds indicates strong market validation of the company's business model and growth strategy in the critical minerals sector.</p><p>The capital infusion will support multiple strategic initiatives including inventory expansion, additional leasehold acquisitions in Alaska and Montana, potential capacity increases at the Madero Smelter, strategic acquisitions, and general working capital requirements. This funding follows expansion efforts undertaken during 2024 and 2025 when the company began acquiring mining claims and leases in Montana, Alaska and Ontario, Canada, representing a concerted effort to broaden both operational footprint and product offerings.</p><p>The company processes third party ore primarily into antimony oxide, antimony metal, antimony trisulfide, and precious metals at its facilities located in Montana and Mexico. These materials serve essential functions across multiple industrial sectors. Antimony oxide forms flame-retardant systems for plastics, rubber, fiberglass, textile goods, paints, coatings, and paper, while also serving as a color fastener in paint and phosphorescent agent in fluorescent light bulbs. Antimony metal finds application in bearings, storage batteries, and ordnance, with antimony trisulfide used as a primer in ammunition.</p><p>Beyond its antimony operations, the company maintains significant zeolite production capabilities at its Bear River Zeolite facility in Idaho. Zeolite represents a group of industrial minerals used in water filtration, sewage treatment, nuclear waste and other environmental cleanup, odor control, gas separation, animal nutrition, soil amendment and fertilizer, and various other applications. This diversification positions the company to address multiple critical infrastructure and environmental challenges while adding revenue streams to its mineral portfolio.</p><p>The company also recovers precious metals, primarily gold and silver, at its Montana facility from third party ore, further enhancing its diversified mineral production capabilities. Titan Partners Group, a division of American Capital Partners, acted as sole placement agent for the offering, which is expected to close on or about October 14, 2025.
