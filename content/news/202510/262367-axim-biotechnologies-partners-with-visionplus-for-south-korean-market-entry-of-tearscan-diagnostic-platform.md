<p>AXIM Biotechnologies, Inc. has entered into an exclusive distribution agreement with VisionPlus Corp. to market and distribute AXIM's TearScan Lactoferrin Test for detecting aqueous-deficient dry eye and TearScan IgE Test for ocular allergy throughout South Korea. The partnership grants VisionPlus exclusive rights to distribute both diagnostic tests, supported by the I-Peak digital reader, across the Korean market.</p><p>The companies will collaborate on Korean MFDS registration, targeting simultaneous submissions for both assays. VisionPlus will lead local compliance, regulatory coordination, and commercialization through its established network of ophthalmology clinics, hospitals, and specialty Dry Eye Centers. The initial term of the agreement is one year, with automatic one-year renewals for an additional four years tied to annual sales milestones.</p><p>Catalina Valencia, President of AXIM Biotechnologies, stated that VisionPlus represents an exceptional partner with proven commitment to advancing ocular health. Their clinical insight and national reach make them ideal to introduce AXIM's TearScan platform to South Korea. This collaboration will bring quantitative tear diagnostics directly to clinicians, improving diagnostic precision and enabling more personalized care for patients suffering from dry eye disease and ocular allergy.</p><p>Jerry Park, President of VisionPlus Corp., explained that years ago, VisionPlus recognized that the global rise in digital device use and worsening environmental conditions would lead to an epidemic of Dry Eye Disease. The company established dedicated Dry Eye Clinics across Korea in anticipation of that need. AXIM's TearScan Lactoferrin and IgE tests will complete their vision—creating a one-stop diagnostic and treatment ecosystem for Dry Eye Disease and related conditions.</p><p>AXIM's TearScan diagnostic portfolio provides quantitative, point-of-care tear biomarker analysis in minutes, using a small tear sample. The system's reader delivers precise measurements that help clinicians differentiate between aqueous-deficient dry eye, evaporative dry eye, and allergic conjunctivitis—a crucial distinction for selecting effective therapy and monitoring patient progress.
