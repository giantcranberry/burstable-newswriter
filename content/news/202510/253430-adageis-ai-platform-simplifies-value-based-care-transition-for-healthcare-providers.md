<p>Adageis CEO Shane Speirs recently detailed how the healthcare technology company's artificial intelligence platform is addressing administrative challenges in value-based care during an episode of The Bell2Bell Podcast. The conversation focused on how Adageis uses AI and machine learning to digitize complex insurance and compliance processes that often burden healthcare providers transitioning to value-based care models.</p><p>We make it easy to see what measures practices need to hit and how to hit them for each individual patient, Speirs explained during the podcast interview. The company currently supports more than 580,000 patient lives through its scalable per-provider model, which has experienced rapid growth as healthcare organizations seek technological solutions for value-based care implementation.</p><p>The platform's significance lies in its ability to simplify the administrative burden that often prevents smaller practices from participating in value-based care arrangements. By automating compliance tracking and performance measurement, Adageis aims to make value-based care accessible to providers of all sizes, not just large healthcare systems with substantial administrative resources.</p><p>Speirs emphasized the company's mission to drive meaningful change across the healthcare sector by integrating advanced technologies with minimal disruption to existing workflows. The conversation explored how Adageis' solutions empower healthcare providers and organizations to enhance patient outcomes while streamlining operations and driving increased revenue through value-based care models.</p><p>The full podcast episode featuring Speirs' insights is available at <a href="https://ibn.fm/a302u" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://ibn.fm/a302u</a>.
