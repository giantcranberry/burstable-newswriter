<p>Rainmaker Worldwide Inc. announced that its affiliate Miranda Water Technologies has been selected to provide decentralized wastewater treatment for a major residential development in Northumberland County, Ontario. The project represents an important step forward in sustainable rural housing and underscores Rainmaker's expanding footprint in the North American market for advanced water infrastructure solutions.</p><p>The development, led by Robe Development Corporation and Stalwood Homes, will integrate Miranda's Miracell® RBC Ultra system, an advanced biological treatment solution that enables sustainable water reuse and supports community-scale development. The community, originally designed for 50 estate homes, can now sustainably support up to 150 homes due to the high efficiency and compact modular design of the Miracell® RBC Ultra. This innovation aligns with the Protect Ontario by Building Faster and Smarter Act, 2025 (Bill 17), which encourages faster and more efficient housing construction supported by modern infrastructure.</p><p>Rural housing expansion has traditionally been constrained by large private septic systems, limiting density and design flexibility. With the Miracell® RBC Ultra, developers can plan more diverse communities with smaller lot sizes, including semi-detached homes, townhouses, and low-rise condominiums. The system also allows for treated water reuse for irrigation and fire protection, improving sustainability and water resilience within the community.</p><p>Michael O'Connor, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of Rainmaker Worldwide Inc., stated that this project demonstrates how Rainmaker's investment in Miranda Water Technologies continues to generate real commercial value. Our technologies are enabling sustainable growth where traditional infrastructure cannot reach. The Miracell® RBC Ultra is a proven example of how we can support housing expansion, environmental protection, and economic development at the same time.</p><p>Al Rose, President of Stalwood Homes, added that the Miracell® RBC Ultra has transformed how they can plan this community. Beyond just the capacity gains, the system's ability to reuse treated water for irrigating shared green spaces and for fire suppression storage makes this a more sustainable, self-reliant community.

The selection reinforces growing demand for Rainmaker's decentralized technologies as governments and developers seek sustainable infrastructure solutions for housing growth. As housing and infrastructure demands increase, particularly in rural and underserved regions, Rainmaker and Miranda are well positioned to capture growing market share across North America.</p><p>The Miracell® RBC Ultra combines biological treatment and membrane filtration within a compact, energy-efficient design. It enables communities to grow sustainably without reliance on traditional centralized infrastructure, establishing Rainmaker as a key player in the next generation of water and wastewater innovation.
