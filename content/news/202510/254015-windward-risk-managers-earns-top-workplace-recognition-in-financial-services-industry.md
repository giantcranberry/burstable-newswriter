<p>Windward Risk Managers, the management entity representing Florida Peninsula Insurance Company, Edison Insurance Company, and Ovation Home Insurance Exchange, has been named to the 2025 Fortune Best Workplaces in Financial Services & Insurance list by Fortune and Great Place To WorkÂ®, achieving the #21 ranking nationally. This recognition places the company as the highest-ranked residential property and casualty insurance provider on the prestigious list, which specifically honors organizations in the Small & Medium category with 10-999 U.S.-based employees.</p><p>The significance of this achievement extends beyond mere workplace recognition in a state where the insurance industry faces constant challenges from hurricane seasons and market volatility. Paul Adkins, CEO of Windward Risk Managers, emphasized that the award reflects the strength of their team and collaborative culture, stating that employees are the driving force behind their success. The company maintains commitment to fostering an environment that values hard work, celebrates achievements, encourages giving back, and makes work enjoyable.</p><p>What distinguishes Windward Risk Managers in this year's evaluation is its unique position among the listed companies. While the list includes banks, wealth firms, benefits consultancies, and specialty commercial insurers, Windward Risk Managers maintains distinct focus on homeowners insurance through their affiliated carriers. Employees describe the organization as having a close-knit culture with big-company resources, creating a rare blend of community, respect, and scale that translates into superior service quality, turnaround times, and customer satisfaction rates.</p><p>The employee experience data reveals remarkable statistics that underscore why this recognition matters for both the company and the broader insurance industry. An impressive 95% of employees report that Windward Risk Managers is a great place to work, compared with just 57% at typical U.S. companies. Standout scores particularly center on ethics, belonging, and pride among staff members. The organization demonstrates healthy growth patterns with 39% of employees joining within the past two years, while simultaneously maintaining strong institutional knowledge through 34% of staff reporting 6-20 years of tenure.</p><p>Founded in 2005, Windward Risk Managers brings two decades of experience in Florida's challenging insurance market, partnering with exclusive and independent agent networks to serve homeowners. The methodology used by Great Place To Work evaluates the consistency and equity of the employee experience using its Trust Index survey, ensuring that the recognition reflects genuine workplace quality rather than superficial measures.
