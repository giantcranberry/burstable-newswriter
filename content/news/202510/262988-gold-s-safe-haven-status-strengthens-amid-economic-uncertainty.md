<p>Gold has maintained its status as a safe haven asset for millennia, valued for its intrinsic worth and historical performance during periods of economic instability, inflation, and geopolitical conflict. As discussions intensify about how much higher gold prices might climb, investors are examining opportunities in gold-linked securities and mining companies.
