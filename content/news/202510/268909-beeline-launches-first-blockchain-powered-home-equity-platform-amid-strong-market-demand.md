<p>Beeline Holdings CEO Nick Liuzza announced the successful launch of BeelineEquity, described as the nation's first blockchain-powered home-equity platform. The innovative platform allows homeowners, particularly targeting baby boomers seeking liquidity, to sell fractional equity in their properties without taking on debt or monthly payment obligations.</p><p>Each transaction on the BeelineEquity platform is tokenized on blockchain technology, creating a transparent and secure method for property equity sharing. Liuzza revealed that the company has already closed five equity transactions in the platform's first week of operation and anticipates approximately 25 additional transactions within the next 45 days. The strong initial response has prompted the company to begin accepting applications for 2026, indicating robust market demand for this new financial product.</p><p>The timing of the platform launch coincides with anticipated interest rate cuts that are expected to improve housing affordability across the nation. Liuzza emphasized that these economic conditions create powerful tailwinds for the digital mortgage sector, positioning Beeline for nationwide expansion. The company's growth strategy leverages these favorable market conditions to scale operations beyond initial launch markets.</p><p>Beeline Holdings, trading on NASDAQ under the symbol BLNE, operates as a mortgage fintech company focused on transforming property financing access. The company's digital approach incorporates artificial intelligence to streamline the loan process for both primary residences and investment properties.

This approach addresses the specific needs of baby boomers who may be house-rich but cash-poor, offering a solution that doesn't involve accumulating debt or committing to monthly payments. The fractional equity model allows multiple investors to participate in property ownership while maintaining the homeowner's primary residence status.</p><p>Industry observers note that the combination of blockchain technology with real estate equity represents an emerging trend in financial technology, potentially creating new markets for property investment and liquidity solutions.
