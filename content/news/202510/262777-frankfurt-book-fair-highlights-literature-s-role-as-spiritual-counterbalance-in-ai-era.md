<p>The 77th Frankfurt Book Fair concluded with more than 4,300 exhibitors from over 90 countries, reaffirming its status as the publishing industry's premier international gathering. The event featured two significant literary forums themed "Wisdom and Transcendence in the AI Era" that positioned award-winning writer Xuemo and his works as central to discussions about literature's evolving role in technological society.</p><p>During the forum events, two of Xuemo's latest works received their official international release: the English edition of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Eternal-Love-Xuemo/dp/1957735005" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Eternal Love</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Way-Out-Rise-Wisdom-Era/dp/1957735013" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">The Way Out: The Rise of Her Wisdom in the AI Era</a>. These publications attracted significant attention from the international publishing community, indicating growing global interest in literature that addresses spiritual concerns amid technological transformation.</p><p>Claudia Kaiser, Vice President for Asia at the Frankfurt Book Fair, emphasized that Xuemo's works reveal universal human struggles and spiritual transcendence that resonate across cultural boundaries. The forums brought together writers, scholars, publishers, and filmmakers from more than ten countries to explore how literature can bridge global divides and how Xuemo's works specifically inspire humanity toward greater awareness and compassion.</p><p>Nora Frisch, founder of Drachenhaus Verlag, offered a particularly relevant perspective for business and technology leaders. She noted that in an era when technology is fundamentally reshaping human existence, Xuemo's literary value extends beyond artistic expression to serve as "a spiritual beacon that safeguards humanity and guides technology toward benevolence." This characterization highlights the growing concern among cultural leaders about maintaining human values and ethical frameworks during rapid technological advancement.</p><p>Academic perspectives further illuminated Xuemo's significance in contemporary literature. Professor Shouhui Zhao from the University of Bergen in Norway observed that Xuemo's creative spirit resonates with that of Jon Fosse, the 2023 Nobel Laureate in Literature. Both writers embody what Zhao described as a "silent aesthetics" rooted in stillness, endurance, and transcendence—qualities that reflect the profound spiritual dimensions increasingly sought in contemporary literature.</p><p>In his address to forum participants, Xuemo articulated a vision for literature's essential role in technological times. He emphasized that writers must be "those who light the lamps" in a world of constant change, suggesting that literature's mission extends beyond storytelling to helping people reshape their inner mindset. Specifically, he advocated for replacing control with compassion and transcending computation with wisdom—a message that sparked strong resonance among audience members.</p><p>The forum's success demonstrates the growing global influence of Chinese literature while marking a significant convergence between world literature's spiritual traditions and technological civilization's evolution. As artificial intelligence continues to transform human experience, events like these Frankfurt Book Fair forums suggest that literature's role in preserving and articulating human values may become increasingly vital to maintaining balance between technological progress and spiritual wellbeing.</p>
