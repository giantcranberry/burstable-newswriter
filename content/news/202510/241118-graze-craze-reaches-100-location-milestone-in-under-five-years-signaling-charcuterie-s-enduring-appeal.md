<p>Graze Craze, the nation's largest charcuterie franchise, has reached a significant milestone with the opening of its 100th location in the Lake Nona community of Orlando, Florida. This achievement comes less than five years after launching its franchise program, positioning the brand among the minority of U.S. franchises that ever achieve this level of expansion.</p><p>Cory Hibbard, who was appointed president in 2022 at 30 years old and has overseen the brand's remarkable growth, emphasized the importance of this milestone. "Hitting 100 locations in such a short period of time is a major milestone, especially when you consider that less than 20% of U.S. franchises ever achieve this number," said Hibbard. "It validates that charcuterie is not a fleeting trend but a timeless, versatile way of dining that brings people together."</p><p>The brand's rapid expansion included growth across the U.S. and international markets in Australia, France, and Canada. Graze Craze is part of United Franchise Group, a global affiliate network of 11 award-winning brands in more than 80 countries. The company has demonstrated strong financial performance with 27 straight weeks of year-over-year average unit volume growth and closed out Q2 2025 as its 16th consecutive positive quarter.</p><p>Ray Titus, CEO of UFG, highlighted the rarity of this achievement in the franchising world. "Crossing the 100-location mark is a rare achievement in franchisingâ€”few brands ever reach this milestone, and those that do have a tremendous success rate," said Titus. "For Graze Craze to accomplish this in less than five years is extraordinary and a true testament to the concept's strength, the commitment of our franchise owners, and the growing consumer appetite for innovative dining experiences."</p><p>Graze Craze has revolutionized the catering industry by creating consistent and convenient charcuterie solutions through its mission to help customers "Celebrate Everything." The brand employs expert Grazologists who curate artfully designed charcuterie boards, boxes, and tables using premium meats, cheeses, fruits, crisp vegetables, and house-made dips, jams, and sauces. The company's growth trajectory continues with 23 new locations opened year-to-date and 45 new franchise agreements signed, securing expansion into new markets.</p><p>To celebrate the 100th store opening, Graze Craze is hosting a nationwide social media contest giving away 100 charcuterie boards to winners in local communities. The brand operates as part of the Big Flavor Brands food service division of UFG, which specializes in franchises dedicated to creative eating.
