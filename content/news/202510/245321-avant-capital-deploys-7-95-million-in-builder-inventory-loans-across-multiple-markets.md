<p>Avant Capital, a Connecticut-based commercial real estate bridge lender, has closed three separate builder inventory loans totaling $7,950,000 for residential properties across multiple states and Puerto Rico. The transactions highlight the company's strategic focus on providing flexible capital solutions for sponsors managing individually deeded residential assets in diverse markets, signaling continued activity in the specialized bridge lending space.</p><p>The largest transaction involved a $4,100,000 bridge loan secured by 21 condominium units within the Jacaranda Trace Condo Portfolio in Venice, Florida. This 55+ active adult community will undergo renovations and marketing under Life Lease agreements by borrower LifeStar Living, which is led by a prominent sports agent and influential NBA figure. The substantial investment in senior housing reflects growing demand in this demographic segment and demonstrates confidence in Florida's real estate market.</p><p>In New York City, Avant provided a $2,500,000 bridge loan secured by 10 sponsor-owned cooperative units located across three Manhattan buildings on the Upper West Side, NoMad, and Midtown East. The sponsor brings more than 45 years of experience in the New York real estate market with a portfolio exceeding 2,000 multifamily apartments and 1 million square feet of commercial space. This transaction underscores the resilience of Manhattan's cooperative market and the continued need for bridge financing in high-cost urban centers.</p><p>The third transaction involved a $1,350,000 bridge loan secured by properties in both Houston, Texas and Puerto Rico. The financing covers a luxury single-family residence in Houston's Hermann Lake community and three resort condominiums within the Wyndham Rio Mar resort in Rio Grande, Puerto Rico. Two of the Puerto Rico villas are operated as short-term rentals, providing immediate income support for the investment and highlighting the growing trend of mixed-use residential strategies.</p><p>Adam Luysterborghs, Managing Principal of Avant, stated that these transactions represent the company's core business of providing inventory loans secured by condo portfolios, co-op shares and residential units that sponsors are leasing, repositioning, or preparing for sale. The company continues to deliver flexible capital solutions supporting experienced sponsors with high-quality residential inventory nationwide.</p><p>For 2025, Avant is targeting bridge loan opportunities ranging from $1 million to $75 million nationwide, with focus on multifamily, senior housing, residential portfolios and industrial assets across high-growth markets including Florida, Texas, New York, North Carolina and Georgia. The company also maintains an active role in acquiring non-performing loans secured by commercial real estate as part of its broader investment approach in the commercial real estate debt market.
