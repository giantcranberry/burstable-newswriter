<p>Impressive Playâ„¢, LLC has introduced a new AI soccer statistics application that enables coaches to collect comprehensive game data through voice commands rather than manual recording. The patent-pending technology allows soccer teams to track over 100 statistics per game without requiring coaches to look away from the field to write or type information.</p><p>According to Sam Sackett, Founder and CEO of Impressive Play, the system addresses a fundamental challenge in continuous motion sports like soccer. For continuous motion sports such as soccer, coaches haven't had an easy way to take up to 17 soccer stats, reliably, Sackett explained. Up to 11 players move simultaneously and when coaches look down to write or type a stat, they often miss other key stats to capture.</p><p>The application works by using artificial intelligence to process and organize statistical comments that coaches voice during games through microphoned earbuds connected to their phones. The AI system captures these verbal inputs and assigns the data to specific players listed in the team roster, allowing coaches to maintain visual focus on the game while collecting detailed performance metrics.</p><p>The timing of this innovation coincides with concerning trends in youth sports participation. The Sports & Fitness Industry Association surveys indicate a decline in American youth sport participation, partly attributed to perceptions that coaching decisions about playing time are primarily opinion-based rather than data-driven. Without reliable statistical information to guide individual and team development, several negative outcomes can emerge including reduced player confidence, damaged team morale, decreased player motivation, and the development of toxic team cultures.</p><p>The Impressive Play app aims to transform this dynamic by providing coaches with objective data to support their decisions. Coaches can use the collected statistics during one-on-one player evaluations, identifying specific areas for improvement and presenting concrete performance data to players. This approach is designed to enhance transparency, build trust between coaches and players, and improve overall team dynamics.</p><p>Youth sports participation plays a crucial role in the mental and physical health of American children, and coaches who spend significant time with young athletes require better tools to ensure positive experiences. The company states that it has invested substantial resources to understand and prioritize the needs of amateur sports coaches, with a mission to develop affordable, time-saving sports technology tools that help coaches improve team performance, enhance team dynamics, and celebrate player achievements.
