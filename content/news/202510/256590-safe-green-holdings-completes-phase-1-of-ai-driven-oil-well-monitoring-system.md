<p>Safe & Green Holdings Corp. has announced the completion of Phase 1 of its intelligent wellsite monitoring system through subsidiary Olenox Corp. The AI-driven platform utilizes the company's Machfu gateway technology to enable real-time, bi-directional monitoring and control capabilities for oil production operations. This system represents a significant advancement in making oil extraction processes more economical and environmentally sustainable.</p><p>The intelligent monitoring system is designed to significantly reduce lifting costs, minimize site visits, and decrease energy consumption while simultaneously optimizing production output. Through a proprietary algorithm, the platform automatically adjusts pumpjack operations based on water-cut levels, improving operational efficiency and extending equipment lifespan. This technological innovation addresses the energy industry's dual challenges of improving operational efficiency while reducing environmental impact.</p><p>Phase 2 of the project will involve full deployment at an Olenox production pad, where the system's capabilities will be tested in real-world conditions. Shareholders will have the unique opportunity to monitor real-time results through a read-only webpage, providing unprecedented transparency in oil production operations. The latest news and updates relating to SGBX are available in the company's newsroom at <a href="https://nnw.fm/SGBX" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://nnw.fm/SGBX</a>.</p><p>The technology's ability to reduce site visits contributes to lower carbon emissions associated with transportation to remote well locations, addressing environmental concerns while improving operational economics. This development comes as the energy industry faces increasing pressure to balance production efficiency with environmental responsibility. The system leverages artificial intelligence to optimize resource utilization and minimize waste, positioning it as a solution for modern energy challenges.</p><p>The completion of Phase 1 marks a significant milestone for Safe & Green Holdings as it expands its technological capabilities beyond its core modular construction business. The company's focus on developing safe and green solutions across various industries aligns with growing market demand for sustainable industrial practices.
