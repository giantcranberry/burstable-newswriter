<p>Wage garnishment has become a widespread feature of the U.S. economy in 2025, reshaping the financial lives of millions of American workers and their families. The legal process that allows creditors or the government to seize a portion of a person's paycheck to cover unpaid debts is deepening financial strain for middle- and lower-income households amid rising costs of living.</p><p>According to TransUnion data, nearly two million Americans had their wages garnished by mid-2025, with another two million projected to follow by year's end. The resumed collection of defaulted federal student loans, following the end of pandemic-era suspensions, is the major driver. The U.S. Department of Education can now automatically withhold up to 15 percent of a borrower's paycheck without a court order, a process expected to affect as much as one in four borrowers by 2026.</p><p>The burden extends beyond federal loans, with private debts, child support, unpaid taxes, and medical bills collectively accounting for a growing share of wage garnishment orders. In many states, up to 25 percent of a worker's disposable earnings can be legally taken each pay period.</p><p>The personal toll of garnishment extends far beyond smaller paychecks. Studies published in the American Economic Review: Insights found that employees undergoing wage garnishment lose about 11 percent of their gross earnings during the typical five-month collection period—a level that frequently pushes families into crisis budgets, late rent payments, or food insecurity. Workers affected by wage garnishment also face increased job turnover, often quitting to seek higher-paying or part-time jobs that might avoid garnishment enforcement entirely.</p><p>ADP's national research shows that garnishment rates are highest among workers aged 35 to 44—the prime years of child-rearing and mortgage payments. For households already balancing child care, medical bills, and debt from rising living costs, even a modest garnishment can trigger a cascade of missed payments and mounting late fees. Families often adjust by cutting back on essentials, postponing medical care, or taking on additional debt, with communities of color disproportionately affected, widening existing racial and economic disparities.</p><p>Lawmakers are beginning to revisit the issue, with legislation introduced in spring 2025 by Senators Ayanna Pressley, Cory Booker, and Elizabeth Warren seeking to suspend wage garnishments on student loan borrowers. Advocates are also urging modernization of the Consumer Credit Protection Act, which limits garnishment amounts but has not been substantially revised in decades.
