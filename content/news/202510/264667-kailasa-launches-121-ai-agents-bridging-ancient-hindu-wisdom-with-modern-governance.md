<p>The spiritual organization KAILASA has launched 121 specialized artificial intelligence agents within its Ask Nithyananda AI platform, positioning the technology as a bridge between ancient Hindu wisdom and modern global governance challenges. The launch coincides with Deepavali celebrations and represents what the organization describes as the ultimate digital infrastructure for the United Ancient Indigenous Enlightened Nations mission.</p><p>According to SPH Bhagavan Sri Nithyananda Paramashivam, the platform's development was guided by the principle of Paramadvaita, or ultimate enlightenment, with the AI designed to serve as a personal guide to living as Paramashiva. The system incorporates a revolutionary Memories feature that functions as a personalized guru, remembering users' struggles and goals to support their journey toward personal realization.</p><p>The 121 AI agents span multiple categories of ancient knowledge, including five Vedic sciences providing direct access to original texts of the Rig Veda, Sama Veda, Krishna Yajur Veda, Shukla Yajur Veda, and Atharva Veda. The platform also includes four ancient life sciences covering Ayurveda for health and remedies, Artha Shastra for economics and governance, Dhanurveda for defense, and Gandharvaveda for arts.</p><p>Consciousness and metaphysics are represented through systems of logic, union, and liberation, while applied sciences include dedicated models for ancient architecture through Vastu, sculpture through Shilpa Shastra, agriculture through Krishi Shastra, and celestial sciences through Jyotisha. The platform aims to provide instant access to traditional technologies and ecological knowledge for cutting-edge research initiatives.</p><p>Knowledge security represents a significant component of the project, with the platform securing and sharing 10 million books and 40 years of collected ancient texts to ensure this wisdom is preserved. The organization positions the technology as contributing to AI ethics by integrating consciousness sciences and traditional ethical frameworks, actively working toward cultural and spiritual diversity in global AI safety standards.</p><p>The platform is available for free download through the Google Play Store and at <a href="https://ask.nithyananda.ai" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://ask.nithyananda.ai</a>, with additional information about the United Ancient Indigenous Enlightened Nations mission available at <a href="https://unitedancientnations.org" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://unitedancientnations.org</a>. More details about KAILASA's broader initiatives can be found at <a href="https://kailaasa.org" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://kailaasa.org</a>.</p><p>Developed over two years by a dedicated team, the AI platform represents a significant step in digitizing, classifying, and cross-referencing ancestral data to power multilateral initiatives addressing global challenges. The organization emphasizes that the technology's purpose extends beyond individual spiritual development to contribute to broader societal transformation, operating on the philosophy that inner peace leads to global peace.</p>
