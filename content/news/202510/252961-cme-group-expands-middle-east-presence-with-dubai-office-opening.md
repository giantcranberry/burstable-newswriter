<p>CME Group, the world's leading derivatives marketplace, has expanded into the Middle East with the opening of its Dubai office in the Dubai International Financial Centre, operating under a DFSA license. The move responds to increasing institutional and retail participation in regional financial markets and builds on years of collaboration with local regulators and brokers.</p><p>Julie Winkler, Chief Commercial Officer at CME Group, stated that surging market participation has fueled demand for broader trading access in the Middle East. The new office will accelerate the company's ability to help clients manage risk and pursue opportunities in global benchmark products. Serge Marston, Head of EMEA at CME Group, described this as a significant step forward in elevating their European, Middle Eastern, and African presence, with the Dubai office serving as the Middle East hub offering enhanced service levels to UAE and surrounding markets.</p><p>Salmaan Jaffery, Chief Business Development Officer at DIFC Authority, welcomed CME Group's presence as testament to Dubai's strategic role as a global financial hub and underscored growing regional opportunities. The Dubai office will be led by Sharif Jaghman, Head of Middle East and Africa, who brings nearly 20 years of financial services experience including previous positions at CME Group in London, New York Stock Exchange, and Euronext.</p><p>CME Group provides listed futures, options and cash markets across major investable asset classes including interest rates, equities, foreign exchange, energy, agricultural products, metals, and cryptocurrency. The company recently listed the spot U.S. Dollar/United Arab Emirates Dirham currency pair on EBS Market and EBS Direct platforms in response to client demand. More information about CME Group's Middle East operations is available at <a href="https://www.cmegroup.com/content/cmegroup/ar.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.cmegroup.com/content/cmegroup/ar.html</a>.</p><p>As the global derivatives leader, CME Group enables clients to trade futures, options, cash and OTC markets while optimizing portfolios and analyzing data. The company's exchanges offer comprehensive global benchmark products across all major asset classes through platforms including CME Globex for futures and options, BrokerTec for fixed income, and EBS for foreign exchange trading. CME Clearing serves as one of the world's leading central counterparty clearing providers, supporting market participants worldwide in efficient risk management and opportunity capture.</p><p>The expansion into Dubai represents a strategic move to capitalize on the Middle East's growing financial market sophistication and increasing demand for sophisticated risk management tools. For regional investors and financial institutions, this development provides enhanced access to global benchmark products and sophisticated trading platforms that were previously less accessible. The move also signals growing confidence in Dubai's regulatory environment and its position as an emerging global financial center, potentially attracting additional international financial services firms to the region.</p><p>For business leaders and investors, CME Group's expanded presence means improved access to global derivatives markets, enhanced risk management capabilities, and greater liquidity in regional currency pairs. The timing coincides with increased Middle Eastern participation in global financial markets and growing institutional demand for sophisticated trading instruments. This expansion could accelerate the region's integration into global financial markets while providing local investors with tools previously available only in major financial centers like London, New York, and Singapore.</p>
