<p>Jonathan Connolly, recently appointed President and Chief Operating Officer of Wealth Advisors Trust Company, is leading the firm's strategic expansion during a period of significant industry transformation. With $4 billion in assets under administration and more than 400 trust relationships nationwide, WATC represents an independent alternative to traditional bank-owned trustees. Connolly brings over 30 years of financial and trust industry experience to his new role, having previously served as CEO and President of Wealthspire Trust LLC.</p><p>What drew Connolly to WATC was the clarity of purpose he found in the advisor-founded company's mission. WATC was founded by advisors who were frustrated that traditional trustees often complicate client relationships instead of supporting them. The firm's mission is to provide kind, responsive, and collaborative trust administration that strengthens advisor and attorney relationships and protects family legacies. This approach comes at a critical time as the industry faces what Connolly identifies as the largest intergenerational wealth transfer in history.</p><p>The new executive's immediate priorities focus on three key growth areas: national expansion, partnership excellence, and operational innovation. WATC is bringing its advisor-friendly model to new regions from New England to the South and West Coast, targeting markets underserved by traditional trustees. The company's independence from bank or custodian ownership positions it uniquely in what Connolly describes as a crowded, commoditized industry. Because we're not owned by a bank or custodian, we don't compete with advisors for their clients, Connolly noted. Our only allegiance is to the advisor, the attorney, and the family we serve together.</p><p>This independence enables WATC to offer collaborative solutions that align with modern estate planning concepts and tax-efficient structures while leveraging South Dakota's strong fiduciary framework. The timing of WATC's expansion coincides with broader industry trends that are redefining how families think about stewardship and trust, with the next generation expecting both digital fluency and ethical alignment. WATC is responding by building systems that enhance communication while maintaining human warmth through their Data Reliability and Service Consistency Framework.</p><p>For advisors and attorneys unfamiliar with WATC, Connolly's core promise is simple: Advisors come to us because they're tired of losing clients to banks. Attorneys turn to us because they need a trustee who protects their client relationship, not one that gets in the middle of it. The company's delegated and directed trust solutions allow professionals to maintain control of their relationships while WATC handles administration with what Connolly describes as kindness, precision, and speed. More information about the company's services can be found at <a href="https://www.wealthadvisorstrust.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.wealthadvisorstrust.com</a>.</p><p>Maintaining WATC's cultural reputation for being both high-performing and heart-centered remains a priority during expansion. We lead with empathy, thoughtfulness, and inquisitiveness, Connolly emphasized. We remind our teams that behind every document, there's a family legacy. Behind every inquiry, there's trust. The company invests heavily in communication training and technology that supports compassion, ensuring every interaction reflects professionalism and care.</p><p>Looking ahead five years, Connolly envisions WATC becoming a household name that is synonymous with advisor-friendly trust company. The company aims to provide a long-term home for advisors, attorneys, and clients who have become disenfranchised by trust companies focused solely on numbers. Our focus is every heart and mind who wants to partner with a trustee that truly cares about collaboration and building long term relationships, Connolly stated. This expansion represents a significant shift in the trust industry landscape, offering financial professionals and their clients an alternative approach to wealth preservation and legacy planning during a transformative period for wealth management.</p>
