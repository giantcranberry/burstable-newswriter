<p>Dream Exchange announced that Elwood Blackwell has made a strategic investment in the company, bringing more than three decades of consumer packaged goods industry experience to the emerging financial platform. Blackwell's career includes advising companies on growth strategy, market expansion, and operational efficiency, with his investment reflecting a personal commitment to addressing systemic barriers in capital markets.</p><p>Blackwell discovered Dream Exchange through a conversation with a colleague at Procter & Gamble and found the company's mission aligned with his investment priorities. Throughout his career, Blackwell has worked with consumer packaged goods companies at various development stages while building his own businesses. His consulting background provided direct exposure to the challenges businesses face when seeking growth capital, particularly those without access to traditional venture capital networks.</p><p>I have spent years watching companies with strong fundamentals struggle to access the capital they needed to scale, Blackwell said. I reached a point where I wanted to be part of building solutions rather than just observing the problems. His investment represents a strategic shift from advising companies to actively participating in market infrastructure development.</p><p>Joe Cecala, Founder and Chief Executive Officer of Dream Exchange, welcomed Blackwell's involvement. We are grateful for Elwood's confidence in what we are building, Cecala said. His investment reflects a growing recognition that the current market structure is not serving everyone it should. We need investors who understand that fixing this is not charity. It is good business.</p><p>Blackwell's commitment extends beyond financial support to applying his industry experience toward creating opportunities for underserved communities. Success brings responsibility, Blackwell noted. I have been fortunate in my career, and now I want to use that experience and those resources to support infrastructure that can open doors for others. Dream Exchange is working to build that infrastructure.</p><p>Dwain Kyles, Managing Member of DX Capital Partners, emphasized that investor support like Blackwell's strengthens Dream Exchange's mission to provide alternative market infrastructure. This is about building something that has never existed before, Kyles said. That takes capital, it takes time, and it takes people who believe the work is worth doing. Elwood is one of those people, and we are proud to have his support.</p><p>Dream Exchange has filed a Form 1 application with the Securities and Exchange Commission seeking registration as a national securities exchange. If approved, it would be the first minority-controlled licensed stock exchange in U.S. history. The organization also supports a venture exchange model designed for smaller, early-stage companies often excluded from public markets.
