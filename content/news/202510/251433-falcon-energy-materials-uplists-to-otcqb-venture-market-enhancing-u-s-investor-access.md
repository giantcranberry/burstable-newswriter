<p>Falcon Energy Materials plc has been approved to uplist from the OTC Pink market to the OTCQB Venture Market, operated by OTC Markets Group Inc. The transition, effective immediately, positions the company on what is recognized as the premier U.S. marketplace for early-stage and developing companies. The OTCQB, established in 2010, provides improved visibility and greater access to U.S. investors and is recognized by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission as an established public market. For more information about the OTCQB and its requirements, visit <a href="https://www.otcmarkets.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.otcmarkets.com</a>.</p><p>Falcon's shares will trade on the OTCQB under the ticker symbol "FLCNF" while continuing to trade on the Toronto TSX Venture Exchange under the symbol "FLCN." The company believes this milestone will enhance liquidity, increase transparency, and broaden its exposure to both retail and institutional investors in the U.S. capital markets. Matthieu Bos, Chief Executive Officer of Falcon, stated that this uplisting marks an important step in the company's growth strategy. Trading on the OTCQB Venture Market aligns with Falcon's commitment to increasing shareholder value, improving market visibility, and maintaining high standards of corporate governance.</p><p>Falcon Energy Materials aims to be the premier provider of natural Coated Spheronized Purified Graphite, a critical component for energy storage solutions. As a dedicated chemical refiner of natural graphite concentrate, Falcon is working toward developing a state-of-the-art 25 ktpa CSPG production facility in Morocco. Once operational, this plant is projected to generate EBITDA of approximately $152 million annually, with an industry-leading EBITDA margin of around 62%. Additional information about the company is available at <a href="https://www.falconem.net" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.falconem.net</a>.</p><p>Strategically partnered with leading Chinese technology firms and Tier One Moroccan partners, Falcon benefits from advanced technological expertise, access to high-quality raw materials and chemicals, and a prime geographical location. These factors are expected to enable consistent, high-quality supply to global markets. With a clear focus on sustainable growth and innovation, Falcon aims to become the go-to producer of natural CSPG, supporting widespread adoption in energy storage and other emerging industries.</p><p>The uplisting to the OTCQB represents a strategic move to strengthen Falcon's market presence and investor base as it progresses toward its production goals. This development comes at a time when demand for battery materials is growing rapidly, driven by the global transition to clean energy and electric vehicles. Falcon's positioning in both Canadian and U.S. markets through this uplisting enhances its ability to capitalize on these trends and attract the capital needed to advance its Moroccan production facility, positioning the company as a key player in the evolving energy storage supply chain.</p>
