<p>ENGWE has expanded its folding electric bike category with the introduction of two new Boost models: the Engine Pro 3.0 Boost and the EP-2 3.0 Boost. This release represents the most significant evolution in the company's flagship Engine series, bringing enhanced power delivery, expanded range capabilities, and integrated smart technology to the folding e-bike market.</p><p>The Engine Pro 3.0 Boost is designed for demanding riders with high-performance features that challenge conventional expectations of folding e-bikes. The model features strengthened full suspension with enhanced joints and bearings that provide a smoother riding experience while improving long-term structural durability. Its high-capacity 48V/15Ah Samsung battery delivers an exceptional range of up to 130 kilometers on a single charge, supported by an 8A fast charger that enables full recharging in just two hours.</p><p>Powering the Engine Pro 3.0 Boost is a 90Nm performance boost motor that delivers 20% more torque than its 75Nm predecessor, ensuring improved climbing capability and faster acceleration. The model also incorporates smart technology features including over-the-air firmware updates, built-in IoT theft protection, GPS tracking, and keyless access systems.

Equipped with a powerful 75Nm motor and extended battery delivering up to 120 kilometers of range, it provides urban commuters with the flexibility to handle daily transportation needs and longer recreational rides. The foldable design, optimized for city living, ensures straightforward storage and portability, making it a practical solution for space-constrained urban environments.</p><p>The Boost designation on both models signifies a core technological upgrade focused on power delivery and acceleration performance. This enhancement involves a more responsive powertrain that translates rider input into immediate and controlled acceleration. The system is engineered to work in harmony with the battery system, ensuring that increased power output does not compromise overall range. This integrated performance approach represents a significant advancement for folding e-bikes, providing riders with more dynamic and confident riding experiences across varied terrain.</p><p>To celebrate the launch, ENGWE has initiated a global campaign including a giveaway running from September 10 through October 3, 2025, where participants can register to win one of the newly launched Boost e-bikes. Additionally, customers placing pre-orders between September 24 and October 3, 2025, will receive four times the standard loyalty points.
