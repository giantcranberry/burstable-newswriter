<p>PowerBank Corporation has executed agreements with the New York State Division of Military and Naval Affairs to develop a 20 MW DC portfolio of solar and battery storage projects across multiple Army National Guard facilities. The portfolio, selected through a competitive process led by the New York Power Authority, represents a significant advancement in military infrastructure modernization and renewable energy integration.</p><p>The comprehensive project includes ground mount, rooftop, and parking canopy systems comprising approximately 19 MW of solar generation capacity and 1 MW/2 MWh of battery storage. This distributed energy resources approach supports multiple DMNA objectives including enhanced operational resilience, climate goal achievement, and substantial cost savings through reduced energy expenditures. The integration of battery storage is particularly crucial for maintaining critical operations during grid outages or emergency situations, providing essential backup power when needed most.</p><p>Construction on the multi-facility project is expected to begin by the end of 2025, with PowerBank's U.S. subsidiary, Abundant Solar Power, leading both development and financing efforts. The timing aligns with New York's broader clean energy initiatives and the military's increasing focus on energy security and independence. The distributed nature of the projects across multiple National Guard facilities provides redundancy and localized power generation benefits that directly support mission-critical operations.</p><p>This portfolio development represents a significant milestone in PowerBank's growth strategy and demonstrates the increasing convergence of renewable energy development with critical infrastructure needs. The company's ability to secure this contract through a competitive NYPA-led process highlights its strong positioning in the distributed energy market.

This project portfolio serves as a model for how public-private partnerships can advance both operational readiness and sustainability objectives simultaneously. The forward-looking nature of such energy investments underscores the strategic importance of resilient power systems for national security infrastructure, setting a precedent for similar installations across military facilities nationwide.</p>
