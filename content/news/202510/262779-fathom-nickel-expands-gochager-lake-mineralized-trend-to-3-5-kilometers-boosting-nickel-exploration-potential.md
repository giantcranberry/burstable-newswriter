<p>Fathom Nickel Inc. has mapped the host rock of the historic Gochager Lake deposit consistently along strike for at least 3.5 kilometers northeast of the original deposit, representing a substantial expansion of the mineralized trend. This geological breakthrough significantly enhances the project's exploration potential and marks a major advancement in identifying new nickel-copper-cobalt resources. The expansion was achieved through updated geological mapping incorporating recent prospecting and portable X-ray fluorescence geochemistry results.</p><p>According to Ian Fraser, CEO and VP Exploration, the company has applied knowledge gained from drilling the historic deposit to surface exploration, significantly expanding the Gochager Lake deposit container rock along strike. This systematic approach demonstrates how targeted exploration can unlock substantial new mineral potential in established mining districts. Fathom has received assays from its July 2025 program and expects additional rock and whole-rock geochemistry results from its Septemberâ€“October work by mid-November.</p><p>These ongoing analytical efforts are crucial for developing high-quality nickel-copper-cobalt drill targets across the expanded project area. The consistent extension of the host rock provides strong geological evidence for continued mineralization along the newly defined trend. Previous exploration at Gochager Lake has already confirmed vertical extension of nickel-copper-cobalt mineralization at least 150 meters below the historic deposit boundary, with multiple high-grade vertically oriented sulphide breccia mineralization zones remaining open for expansion in all directions.</p><p>This expansion comes at a critical time for nickel supply, as the metal becomes increasingly important for electric vehicle batteries and renewable energy infrastructure. The ability to extend known mineralized systems through careful geological mapping and modern exploration techniques demonstrates how established mining districts can continue to yield significant new discoveries. The full press release detailing these developments is available at <a href="https://ibn.fm/sGaFc" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://ibn.fm/sGaFc</a>.</p><p>The Gochager Lake project represents one of three key exploration assets in Fathom's Saskatchewan portfolio, which targets magmatic nickel sulphide discoveries to support North American critical minerals supply and the global green energy transition. Fathom's broader exploration strategy includes the Albert Lake Project, which hosts the historic Rottenstone Mine and has shown promising extensions of high-grade mineralization, and the Friesen Lake Project located between the company's other Saskatchewan assets. The consistent geological trends being identified across these projects highlight the potential of the Trans Hudson Corridor as a significant nickel sulphide district.
