<p>Kontron AG has released preliminary financial figures for the first nine months of 2025, confirming its full-year profit guidance while addressing recent market concerns about its share price performance. The global IoT technology company reported revenue of €1,182 million for the nine-month period, compared to €1,208 million in the same period last year, with the decline primarily attributed to the strategic discontinuation of its COM business.</p><p>Despite the revenue decrease, the company demonstrated significant profitability improvement with EBITDA surging 37% to €194 million from €141 million in the previous year. This performance includes a one-off effect of approximately €46 million resulting from the deconsolidation of the COM business. On an operating basis, excluding this one-time item, EBITDA for the first nine months reached approximately €148 million, reflecting the company's successful transition toward higher-margin operations.</p><p>Management maintained its full-year 2025 guidance, expecting revenue of €1.7 billion, revised from the previous €1.8 billion forecast to account for the COM business discontinuation. The company confirmed its EBITDA projection of approximately €270 million, which includes around €220 million in operating EBITDA plus preliminary one-off income of €46 million from portfolio adjustments. This strategic realignment allows Kontron to focus on more profitable segments within its IoT technology portfolio.</p><p>CEO Hannes Niederhauser emphasized the company's strong operational performance, stating that Kontron continues to see robust order intake with a book-to-bill ratio exceeding 1x. He specifically highlighted strength in key growth areas including railway infrastructure, defense, aerospace, and artificial intelligence. These sectors represent core components of Kontron's strategic focus following its acquisition of Katek SE in early 2024, which significantly expanded the company's capabilities in renewable energy and electric mobility through its new GreenTec division.</p><p>The preliminary results announcement comes in response to recent market volatility affecting Kontron's share price, with management seeking to provide transparency and prevent unfounded speculation. The company, which maintains a significant global presence with approximately 7,000 employees across more than 20 countries, will publish its complete financial results for the first nine months of 2025 on November 5 as originally scheduled.
