<p>TestSprite, the agentic testing tool for AI-native development, has closed a $6.7 million seed round, bringing total funds raised to approximately $8.1 million. Trilogy Equity Partners led the round, with participation from both new and existing investors including Techstars, Jinqiu Capital, MiraclePlus, Hat-trick Capital, Baidu Ventures, and EdgeCase Capital Partners. The funding comes as the company experiences rapid growth, expanding 6X over the last three months and reaching over 35,000 users following the launch of TestSprite 2.0 and its MCP server.</p><p>The timing of this investment addresses a critical challenge in modern software development. As AI-powered coding tools like Cursor, Windsurf, and GitHub Copilot accelerate development speed, they create a new bottleneck in testing and validating AI-generated code at scale. Gartner projects that 90% of enterprise developers will use AI-assisted tools by 2028, up from under 14% in early 2024, indicating a massive total addressable market exceeding $30–50 billion in the coming years.</p><p>Andrew Ng, a globally recognized leader in AI and co-founder of Google Brain, emphasized the importance of this development, stating that as AI gets better at generating code, ensuring that code works as intended becomes even more important. Reliable evaluation pipelines are critical for scaling trustworthy AI systems.</p><p>Yuval Neeman, Managing Director at Trilogy Equity Partners, explained the fundamental shift occurring in software development. While everyone focuses on AI writing code faster, the real constraint is validation. TestSprite is the first to solve testing at the speed of AI, and the rapid growth quarter-over-quarter proves developers are desperate for this solution.</p><p>Yunhao Jiao, CEO and co-founder of TestSprite, highlighted the core problem facing developers today. Writing code is no longer the hard part—the real challenge is ensuring it behaves exactly as intended. AI coding tools like Cursor have made development 10x faster, but they've also created a new risk bottleneck where testing and validation can't keep up. TestSprite functions as the autopilot layer that turns AI-written code into production-ready software without the manual testing overhead that slows teams down.</p><p>The platform addresses a growing frustration among developers who find that vibe coding, building quickly with AI copilots, can become more time-consuming than traditional development when debugging begins. Early adopters report cutting testing cycles from days to minutes, enabling teams to ship multiple releases per week instead of monthly. TestSprite's autonomous agent works directly inside AI IDEs and through MCP integration, enabling test-driven development throughout the coding process rather than as a separate phase after code is written.</p><p>TestSprite's AI automatically generates frontend and backend tests, executes them, diagnoses failures, and proposes potential fixes through simple natural language commands. By enabling agentic testing where TestSprite's AI agent writes, runs, and updates tests autonomously, it dramatically accelerates developer velocity while maintaining quality. The company plans to channel funds toward expanding its engineering team to deepen capabilities in test generation, AI-powered test healing, and intelligent monitoring, while scaling infrastructure to support teams deploying thousands of code changes daily. TestSprite aims to become the industry standard testing layer for AI-native development by mid-2026.
