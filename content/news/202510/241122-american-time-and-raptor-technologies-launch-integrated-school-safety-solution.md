<p>The integration between American Time's EverAlert system and Raptor Technologies' Emergency Management System represents a significant advancement in school safety technology. This combined solution delivers rapid, consistent, and automated campus-wide communications for both everyday use and critical emergencies, addressing the growing need for reliable safety infrastructure in educational environments.</p><p>A key feature of the integration is its built-in support for The "I Love U Guys" Foundation's Standard Response Protocol (SRP), providing schools with a nationally recognized framework for emergency response. The system also ensures compliance with state and federal safety mandates, including Alyssa's Law requirements for silent panic alert systems directly linked to law enforcement. This compliance aspect is particularly crucial as schools nationwide work to meet evolving safety standards.</p><p>The integration leverages the daily utility of EverAlert while incorporating Raptor's advanced emergency response workflows. EverAlert supports daily synchronized time scheduling, announcements, and audiovisual messaging across classrooms, hallways, and common areas. Because these devices serve as trusted, everyday sources of information, occupants instinctively turn to them during critical events for reliable emergency guidance, creating a foundation of familiarity that enhances emergency response effectiveness.</p><p>Through Raptor Connect™, EverAlert ties directly into Raptor Technologies' automated emergency response sequences. When a crisis alert is activated—such as a lockdown or evacuation—EverAlert instantly carries out pre-configured messaging and instructions across designated zones. This automation minimizes manual steps and accelerates coordinated response, potentially saving critical seconds during emergencies. The system ensures synchronized response across all devices, with displays and speakers broadcasting appropriate messages, tones, and instructions campus-wide or to targeted zones.</p><p>Chris Noell, Chief Product Officer at Raptor Technologies, emphasized the importance of standardization and speed in emergency situations, stating that bringing together Raptor, SRP, and EverAlert helps communicate instantly and consistently across every corner of a campus. Tim Leung, VP of Engineering & Operations at American Time, highlighted how EverAlert's dual role as both daily operations tool and crisis awareness system builds trust and understanding among students and staff.</p><p>The integration is designed for seamless implementation, allowing schools and districts already using Raptor or EverAlert to adopt the new functionality without reworking their existing system architecture. This approach minimizes disruption and costs while maximizing the safety benefits of the combined system. The solution is now available nationwide, providing districts with a unified approach to everyday communication and emergency management that aligns with national safety protocols.
