<p>Fidelity Bancorp Funding, a private credit platform specializing in real estate bridge lending, has secured a $300 million investment commitment from TCW, significantly expanding its lending capacity to $600 million. The capital infusion comes at a critical time when traditional banks are reducing their real estate exposure, creating financing gaps for private real estate investors.</p><p>David Frosh, Chief Executive Officer of FBF, emphasized the strategic importance of this partnership. This infusion of capital from TCW positions us to serve more borrowers while continuing to deliver strong, risk-adjusted returns to our investors, Frosh stated. As banks retreat, our selective bridge lending approach enables us to fill a critical financing gap and support high-quality real estate operators with speed and certainty.</p><p>The expanded lending capacity allows FBF to capitalize on what company President Charlie Woo described as one of the most attractive market environments we've seen in decades. The partnership reflects growing institutional appetite for private credit strategies backed by real assets, particularly as investors seek durable income opportunities amid market volatility.</p><p>TCW, which manages over $200 billion in assets, demonstrated strong confidence in FBF's platform and underwriting discipline. Max Scherr, Managing Director and Portfolio Manager at TCW, noted that the company's disciplined underwriting and deep expertise in real estate make them a compelling partner in today's environment. The investment aligns with TCW's focus on sourcing high-quality private opportunities through its TCW ABF business.</p><p>Fidelity Bancorp Funding specializes in first-lien bridge loans secured by commercial and multifamily real estate, serving private investors who own approximately 85% of U.S. commercial and multifamily properties. Through its managed private credit REITs, the company provides accredited investors and Registered Investment Advisors with access to diversified, institutional-quality portfolios designed to generate consistent income. More information about their lending programs is available at <a href="https://www.fbfloans.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.fbfloans.com</a>.</p><p>The partnership underscores the broader trend of institutional capital flowing into private credit markets as traditional lending sources contract. This movement represents a fundamental shift in real estate finance, with specialized platforms like FBF increasingly filling the void left by conventional financial institutions. For business and technology leaders, this development signals a significant transformation in how commercial real estate financing operates, potentially creating new investment opportunities while addressing critical funding needs in a sector experiencing traditional bank withdrawal.</p>
