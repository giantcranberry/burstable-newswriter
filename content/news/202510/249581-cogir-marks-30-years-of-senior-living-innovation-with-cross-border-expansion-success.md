<p>Cogir is celebrating its 30th anniversary this year, marking three decades of innovation, growth, and a people-first approach to real estate and senior living. What began as a small Canadian venture has evolved into a cross-border success story that now spans over 100 communities in the United States alone. This expansion trajectory highlights the growing demand for quality senior living options and demonstrates how successful business models can translate across international borders.</p><p>The company's journey began in 1995 when Serge G. Duguay, a passionate real estate entrepreneur in Qu√©bec, Canada, founded Cogir at age 55. With an initial focus on revitalizing shopping centers, Serge enlisted his 17-year-old son, Mathieu Duguay, to help manage a property, sparking what would become a lifelong passion for community-building. By 1999, Cogir had expanded into residential and retirement living, setting the stage for its future in senior care. This early diversification proved crucial for the company's long-term strategic positioning in the growing senior living market.</p><p>In 2004, Serge passed the torch to Mathieu, selling him the company while remaining actively involved. Under Mathieu's leadership, Cogir diversified further, launching its own development and construction division in 2008 to take projects from blueprint to reality. This vertical integration proved crucial for the company's expansion strategy and quality control, allowing Cogir to maintain consistent standards across its growing portfolio of communities.</p><p>A significant turning point came in 2013 when Cogir partnered with <a href="https://www.welltower.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Welltower</a>, a global leader in health and wellness real estate, laying the groundwork for international expansion. The partnership accelerated in 2018 when Cogir and Welltower completed their first U.S. collaboration, acquiring 12 communities across Washington and California. Just two years later, in 2020, Cogir USA was officially established with a dedicated leadership team and ambitious vision. This strategic partnership model demonstrates how collaboration with established industry players can facilitate rapid international growth.</p><p>Today, Cogir USA manages over 100 communities across the country, offering vibrant senior living experiences rooted in human connection, creativity, and excellence. The company provides exceptional dining, wellness programming, and purpose-driven care while maintaining its founding values. For more information about their communities and services, visit <a href="https://www.cogirusa.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.cogirusa.com</a>. Thirty years ago, we set out to create spaces where people could thrive, not just live, said Mathieu Duguay, CEO of Cogir. Today, with over 100 communities in the U.S. and a legacy of innovation behind us, we're just getting started.</p><p>As Cogir celebrates this milestone, the company remains focused on its mission of building communities that foster joy, connection, and purpose for residents and team members alike. The growth of Cogir USA underscores the increasing demand for quality senior living options and the successful translation of a Canadian business model to the American market. Recognized as one of ASHA's top 10 senior living providers, Cogir's expansion reflects both market opportunity and the company's ability to maintain its core values while scaling operations across international borders. This case study offers valuable insights for business leaders considering international expansion in the senior living and healthcare real estate sectors.</p>
