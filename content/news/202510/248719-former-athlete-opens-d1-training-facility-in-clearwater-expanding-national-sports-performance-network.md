<p>Jeff Ritch, a former University of Richmond football player, and his wife Lauren are opening a D1 Training facility in Clearwater on October 13 at 2265 Gulf to Bay Boulevard. The Florida natives join a franchise network that includes former professional and collegiate athletes, with notable partners such as NBA star Chris Paul and Heisman Trophy winner Tim Tebow.</p><p>As a fourth-generation St. Petersburg financial advisor and former athlete, Jeff Ritch brings unique insight into the value of specialized athletic training. "There was nothing like this for me growing up, and if there was, I would have felt much more prepared for college football," Ritch stated. "Being able to prep kids and show them what it takes to be a D1 athlete, while also having fun and promoting teamwork, is something that I am looking forward to."</p><p>The facility employs a sports-science backed training regimen led by certified trainers, utilizing five core tenets of athletic-based training: dynamic warm-up, performance, strength program, core and conditioning, and cool down. D1 Training offers four age-based programs including Rookie for ages 7-11, Developmental for ages 12-14, Prep for ages 15-18, and D1 Adult programs. Beyond group workouts, the facility provides group, semi-private, and one-on-one training with world-class coaches.</p><p>Dan Murphy, the brand's Chief Operating Officer, expressed confidence in the Ritch's ability to serve the Clearwater community. "Jeff and Lauren are the ideal candidates to bring the D1 Training experience to Clearwater," Murphy said. "We're thrilled to welcome them to the D1 family and are confident in their ability to show the Clearwater area what they've been missing out on."</p><p>The Clearwater location joins more than 150 D1 Training facilities already operating nationwide, with over 100 additional locations in various stages of development. Founded in 2001 by former NFL player Will Bartholomew and based in Nashville, D1 Training currently impacts approximately 30,000 athletes of all ages across the country. For those interested in franchise opportunities, additional information is available at <a href="https://www.d1franchise.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.d1franchise.com/</a>.</p><p>This expansion represents the growing demand for professional-grade athletic training facilities that bridge the gap between recreational sports and collegiate-level preparation. The business model demonstrates how former athletes are leveraging their expertise to create sustainable businesses while addressing a market need for structured athletic development programs. The franchise's continued growth indicates strong consumer interest in scientifically-backed training methodologies and suggests potential for further market penetration in the sports performance industry.</p>
