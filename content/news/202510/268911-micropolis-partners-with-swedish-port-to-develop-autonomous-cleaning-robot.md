<p>Micropolis Holding Co. (NYSE American: MCRP) has entered into a collaborative agreement with Helsingborgs Hamn AB, operator of the Port of Helsingborg in Sweden, and MCS Robotics AB to jointly develop and test the Box Cleaner, an autonomous robotic cleaning system designed for port and industrial environments. The collaboration was announced through a press release available at <a href="https://ibn.fm/HJXkz" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://ibn.fm/HJXkz</a>.</p><p>The Box Cleaner represents a significant expansion of Micropolis' technology applications beyond its traditional focus on security and law enforcement robotics. Built on Micropolis' proprietary M2 platform, the system integrates the company's AI navigation software, edge-computing architecture, and autonomous control systems. This technological foundation enables the robot to operate autonomously for extended periods while optimizing energy and water usage through AI-driven navigation and edge-computing capabilities.</p><p>The trial at Helsingborg Port, recognized as one of the most advanced and sustainability-focused ports in Scandinavia, will serve as a critical testing ground for the technology. During the trials, the system will collect operational data to refine performance ahead of planned commercial rollout in European and Middle Eastern markets. The autonomous cleaning system is specifically designed for large outdoor and semi-industrial environments where it can perform precision cleaning operations without human intervention.</p><p>This development carries important implications for industrial sustainability and operational efficiency. The project directly supports environmental goals by reducing manual labor requirements, lowering emissions, and minimizing resource consumption in port and industrial cleaning operations. By automating cleaning tasks that traditionally require human workers and substantial resource inputs, the technology addresses both labor challenges and environmental concerns simultaneously.</p><p>The partnership positions Micropolis to leverage its expertise in unmanned ground vehicles and AI-driven solutions in new market segments. The collaboration with MCS Robotics brings specialized robotics knowledge to the project, while Helsingborgs Hamn provides a real-world testing environment that aligns with Scandinavia's reputation for technological innovation and sustainability leadership. The successful implementation of this technology could establish new standards for automated maintenance in industrial settings worldwide.</p><p>Investors can access the latest news and updates relating to MCRP through the company's newsroom at <a href="https://ibn.fm/MCRP" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://ibn.fm/MCRP</a>. The development marks a strategic diversification for Micropolis as the company applies its core technologies to broader industrial and infrastructure applications beyond its established security markets.</p>
