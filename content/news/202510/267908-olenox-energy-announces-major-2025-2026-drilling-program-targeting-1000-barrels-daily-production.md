<p>Olenox Energy, a subsidiary of Safe & Green Holdings Corp., has detailed an extensive drilling program set to begin in the fourth quarter of 2025 with continued expansion throughout 2026. The vertically integrated energy company aims to achieve a production target of 1,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day by the end of 2026, marking a substantial increase in domestic energy output. This strategic initiative focuses on developing both legacy and new wells within the company's existing oil and gas portfolio to strengthen its energy production foundation.</p><p>The company has commenced preliminary assessments of multiple drilling locations across its current lease holdings in Texas, Kansas, and Oklahoma. Olenox intends to complete at least one new drilling project before concluding the initial program phase, with additional projects following as momentum builds. The company's vertically integrated operational model incorporates artificial intelligence-enabled wellsite monitoring systems that enhance efficiency and optimize production throughout drilling and extraction processes.</p><p>A critical element of Olenox's operational approach involves collaboration with technology partner OneQode, which provides secure, real-time data flow infrastructure. This partnership ensures continuous monitoring and analysis of production data, enabling rapid adjustments to maximize output and operational efficiency. The integration of advanced digital technologies throughout the drilling and production lifecycle represents a modernized approach to traditional energy extraction methods.</p><p>Recent infrastructure improvements and strategic alliances align with broader national objectives of energy independence and digital resilience. The company's expansion plans emerge during a period when domestic energy production remains vital to national security and economic stability. By leveraging existing lease holdings and implementing sophisticated monitoring technologies, Olenox aims to meaningfully contribute to domestic energy supplies while maintaining operational efficiency and security standards.</p><p>The drilling program's progress will be monitored through established communication channels, including updates available through the corporate newsroom at https://ibn.fm/SGBX. As the energy sector continues evolving, Olenox's fusion of traditional energy extraction with modern digital infrastructure positions the company to potentially benefit from both current market conditions and future energy demands. The planned multi-state expansion demonstrates the company's commitment to scaling operations while preserving the technological advantages that distinguish its energy production methodology.</p>
