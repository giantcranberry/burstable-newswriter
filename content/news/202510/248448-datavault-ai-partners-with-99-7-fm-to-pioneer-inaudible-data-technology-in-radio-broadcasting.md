<p>Datavault AI has launched a strategic partnership with Southwest U.S. radio station 99.7 FM to commercialize its patented ADIO Inaudible Tones technology through a one-year pilot program. This initiative represents the first mainstream broadcast application of ADIO's data-over-sound innovation, integrating Datavault's ADIO and Data Vault data monetization services into 99.7 FM's live events and advertising platforms.</p><p>Co-Founder and CMO Sonia Choi, who initiated the collaboration, emphasized the significance of 99.7 FM's adoption, stating it sets the stage for new revenue creation and expanded advertising inventory. The technology enables interactive, two-way audience engagement through sound-triggered mobile communications, effectively bridging digital and physical experiences for radio listeners. This advancement could transform how broadcasters interact with their audience, moving beyond traditional one-way communication to create immersive, responsive experiences.</p><p>The pilot program, which is pending FCC approval, advances Datavault AI's expansion across the $28.75 billion U.S. radio advertising market. This deployment represents a significant milestone for the company's patented technology, which utilizes inaudible tones to transmit data through sound waves that can trigger responses on mobile devices without disrupting the listening experience. For business leaders in media and advertising, this technology opens new possibilities for audience measurement, targeted advertising, and real-time engagement that were previously unavailable in traditional radio formats.</p><p>Datavault AI's technology suite includes the Information Data Exchange, which enables Digital Twins and licensing of name, image, and likeness by securely attaching physical real-world objects to immutable metadata objects. The company's cloud-based platform provides comprehensive solutions serving multiple industries, including HPC software licensing for sports and entertainment, events and venues, biotech, education, fintech, real estate, healthcare, and energy sectors.
