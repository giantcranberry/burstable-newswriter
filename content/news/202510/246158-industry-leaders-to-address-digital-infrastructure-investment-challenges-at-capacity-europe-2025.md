The panel titled "The Investment Outlook for Digital Infrastructure" will bring together financial and technology leaders to address the complex challenges facing the industry as artificial intelligence drives unprecedented demand for new projects.</p><p>The surge of AI has created significant investment pressure in digital infrastructure, with many projects moving forward without clear visibility into when returns will materialize. Mahmood will chair the session scheduled for October 21, 2025, from 4:50 pm to 5:30 pm GMT at the InterContinental London, where panelists will examine cost and demand dynamics affecting the sector.</p><p>Joining Mahmood will be Edward Rubin, Managing Director of TMT Investment Banking at Goldman Sachs, and Jeroen Kleinjan, Managing Director and Global Lead for Telecom, TMT & Healthcare at ING. The discussion will also feature Ugne Kleinauskaite, Network Investments Manager at Meta, Victor Pons Mesman, CFO and CSO of Lyntia Networks, and Pascale Labrecque, Principal for Investment Management at DigitalBridge.</p><p>Key topics will include the shifting landscape from private to public funding sources and the growing importance of technology and energy partnerships in scaling infrastructure sustainably. The panel aims to identify strategies that can attract investors while addressing the substantial power requirements of modern digital infrastructure, particularly as AI workloads continue to expand globally.</p><p>ZincFive, the world leader in nickel-zinc battery-based solutions for immediate power applications, brings relevant expertise to the discussion given the critical role of reliable power systems in supporting digital infrastructure expansion.

Capacity Europe 2025 serves as a major gathering point for global leaders in connectivity and digital infrastructure to examine the forces shaping the industry's future development and investment patterns.</p><p>The timing of this discussion is particularly crucial as AI-driven demand creates new pressure points across the digital infrastructure ecosystem. Industry leaders face the dual challenge of scaling capacity rapidly while ensuring financial viability, with many projects lacking clear return timelines. The participation of major financial institutions like Goldman Sachs and ING signals the growing importance of structured investment approaches in this rapidly evolving sector.</p><p>The focus on power requirements highlights one of the most significant bottlenecks in digital infrastructure expansion. As AI workloads demand increasingly substantial energy resources, reliable power solutions become essential for sustainable growth. The inclusion of energy technology expertise through ZincFive's participation underscores the interconnected nature of technology and energy infrastructure in supporting AI-driven digital transformation.</p><p>This high-level discussion represents a critical opportunity for industry stakeholders to align on investment strategies that balance rapid expansion with financial sustainability.
