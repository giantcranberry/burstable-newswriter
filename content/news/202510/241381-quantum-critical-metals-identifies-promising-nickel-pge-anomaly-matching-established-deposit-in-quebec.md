<p>Quantum Critical Metals Corp. has completed two airborne geophysical surveys at its NMX East Property in Northern Quebec, identifying a magnetic anomaly that closely matches the signature of the adjacent Nisk nickel and platinum group elements deposit. The company conducted an initial electromagnetic, very low frequency electromagnetic and magnetic survey in September 2025 to validate historical government data, immediately followed by a second MAG-TDEM airborne survey after initial results showed promising magnetic characteristics.</p><p>The magnetic anomaly detected during the first survey prompted the immediate follow-up investigation, with the second TDEM system survey identifying good quality bedrock conductors at greater depths than previously possible with VLF-EM technology. According to technical documentation available at <a href="https://gq.mines.gouv.qc.ca/documents/EXAMINE/GM73786/GM73786RAP001.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://gq.mines.gouv.qc.ca/documents/EXAMINE/GM73786/GM73786RAP001.pdf</a>, the Nisk deposit shows similar geophysical characteristics to what Quantum has now identified at NMX East.</p><p>The significance of these findings lies in the direct comparison to the established Nisk deposit, with Quantum's magnetic anomaly matching in amplitude, strike, shape and size. This geological similarity suggests potential for comparable nickel-PGE mineralization at the NMX East Property. The James Bay region of Quebec is known for hosting significant lithium, nickel and platinum group element deposits, making these findings particularly relevant for critical metals exploration.</p><p>As noted in recent mineral exploration research available at <a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/min14121286" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://doi.org/10.3390/min14121286</a>, nickel and PGE deposits are commonly identified using airborne and magnetic surveys to locate specific rock types of interest. The successful application of these techniques at NMX East represents an important advancement in the property's exploration program.</p><p>Company CEO Marcy Kiesman stated that the similarity between the NMX East magnetic anomaly and the Nisk deposit anomaly is encouraging for shareholders. With significant exploration activity occurring throughout the James Bay area, these results position Quantum favorably within the region's growing critical metals sector. The company is now planning detailed drill targets and intends to apply for drill permits in the coming weeks, moving the project toward the next critical phase of mineral confirmation.</p><p>The discovery of a magnetic anomaly matching established deposit characteristics represents a substantial step forward in Quebec's critical metals exploration landscape. As global demand for nickel and platinum group elements continues to grow for electric vehicle batteries and other clean energy technologies, successful identification of new deposits becomes increasingly important for North American supply chain security.</p>
