<p>u-blox has launched the UBX-M10150-KB chip and MAX-M10N module, marking the first M10-platform GNSS hardware designed with firmware upgradeability. Both products run the new SPG 5.30 firmware, which introduces Low Energy Accurate Positioning technology that reduces power consumption by up to 50 percent while maintaining superior positioning accuracy. This advancement represents a significant step forward for battery-powered IoT devices requiring precise location tracking.</p><p>The new products are specifically engineered for applications including vehicle, people, and pet tracking, as well as livestock monitoring and wearable devices. With ultra-low power consumption of just 8 mW in continuous tracking mode, these GNSS solutions address the critical need for extended battery life in portable and remote tracking applications. The firmware upgradeability provides a future-proof solution, allowing customers to benefit from ongoing performance enhancements and new functionality throughout the product lifecycle.</p><p>SPG 5.30 firmware delivers several technical improvements beyond power efficiency. LEAP replaces cyclic tracking mode to achieve significant energy savings through external LNA power cycling, while RTCM corrections input supports positioning accuracy down to the sub-meter level. The firmware also adds data logging and geo-fencing functions, enabling more autonomous tracking and monitoring directly on the device without constant communication with central servers.</p><p>Both products include lifetime access to <a href="https://www.u-blox.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">AssistNow Predictive Orbits and Live Orbits</a>, which accelerate start-up times and improve positioning performance when using small antennas or operating in weak-signal environments. For developers, the <a href="https://www.u-blox.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">EVK-M102 evaluation kit</a> and <a href="https://www.u-blox.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">u-center 2 software</a> are available to simplify the design-in phase. The UBX-M10150-KB and MAX-M10N running SPG 5.30 firmware are available as engineering samples now, with full availability scheduled for later in October 2025.</p><p>The combination of firmware upgradeability with enhanced power efficiency and positioning accuracy positions these products to significantly impact the growing IoT tracking market. By enabling longer operational times between battery charges while maintaining reliable location data, these advancements could accelerate adoption across multiple industries including logistics, personal safety, and agricultural monitoring applications. This technology addresses one of the fundamental constraints in IoT deployment - battery life - while providing the positioning accuracy required for mission-critical tracking applications.</p>
