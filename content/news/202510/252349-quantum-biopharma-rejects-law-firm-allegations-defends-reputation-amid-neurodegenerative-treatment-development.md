<p>Quantum BioPharma Ltd. has issued a formal response rejecting what it described as vague and unsubstantiated claims made by The Schall Law Firm and DJS Law Group regarding alleged securities law violations. The company stated that the announcements lack factual detail or context and appear intended to mislead investors and provoke unwarranted concern. Quantum BioPharma said it is reviewing the conduct of both firms and their principals and will take appropriate action to address what it believes is a deliberate attempt to harm its reputation.</p><p>The biopharmaceutical company, which maintains its corporate newsroom at <a href="https://ibn.fm/QNTM" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://ibn.fm/QNTM</a>, is dedicated to building a portfolio of innovative assets and biotech solutions for the treatment of challenging neurodegenerative and metabolic disorders and alcohol misuse disorders. Through its wholly owned subsidiary, Lucid Psycheceuticals Inc., Quantum BioPharma is focused on the research and development of its lead compound, Lucid-MS, a patented new chemical entity shown to prevent and reverse myelin degradation in preclinical models.</p><p>Quantum BioPharma's response to the law firm announcements comes as the company continues developing treatments for multiple sclerosis and other conditions. The company invented unbuzzd(TM) and spun out its OTC version to Unbuzzd Wellness Inc., with Quantum BioPharma retaining ownership of 20.11% of the company as of March 31, 2025. The agreement with Unbuzzd Wellness Inc. also includes royalty payments of 7% of sales from unbuzzd(TM) until payments to Quantum BioPharma total $250 million, after which the royalty drops to 3% in perpetuity.</p><p>The company emphasized its commitment to maintaining its reputation amid these challenges, noting that it retains 100% of the rights to develop similar products or alternative formulations specifically for pharmaceutical and medical uses. Quantum BioPharma also maintains a portfolio of strategic investments through its wholly owned subsidiary, FSD Strategic Investments Inc., which represents loans secured by residential or commercial property.</p><p>The full press release detailing Quantum BioPharma's position is available at <a href="https://ibn.fm/TsBbx" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://ibn.fm/TsBbx</a>. The company's strong rejection of the allegations and its stated intention to review the law firms' conduct highlights the importance of accurate information dissemination in the investment community, particularly for companies developing treatments for serious medical conditions. This situation underscores the critical need for transparent communication between biopharmaceutical companies and investors, especially when developing treatments for conditions affecting millions worldwide.</p><p>For business leaders and investors in the healthcare technology sector, this development serves as a reminder of the legal and reputational challenges facing innovative biotech companies. The aggressive response from Quantum BioPharma demonstrates how companies are increasingly taking proactive measures to protect their market position and investor confidence during critical research and development phases.
