<p>Henrico County-based Owens & Minor is undergoing a fundamental transformation by selling its largest business segment to private equity firm Platinum Equity for $375 million. The Fortune 500 healthcare logistics company announced it will divest its Products & Healthcare Services division, marking a strategic pivot toward its higher-margin Patient Direct business that supplies home medical equipment and services directly to patients. The transaction, expected to close by year-end, will effectively convert Owens & Minor from a sprawling medical supply distributor into a streamlined home-care specialist.</p><p>The decision follows a turbulent period for the 140-year-old company, which has struggled with profitability amid industry consolidation and inflationary pressures. Earlier this year, the company abandoned a planned $1.36 billion acquisition of Rotech Healthcare Holdings and paid an $80 million termination fee, citing changing market conditions. Chief Executive Edward A. Pesicka described the current sale as a critical step toward long-term growth, stating the move will allow the company to dedicate resources to more profitable operations.</p><p>Platinum Equity, the Beverly Hills-based private equity firm founded by billionaire Tom Gores, brings extensive experience in healthcare acquisitions, including the 2002 merger that formed SourceOne Healthcare Technologies. Platinum Equity co-president Jacob Kotzubei expressed commitment to enhancing the global capabilities of the acquired business, noting Owens & Minor's vital role in supporting healthcare providers and patients nationwide.</p><p>Financial terms include $375 million in cash at closing, with Owens & Minor retaining a 5% equity interest in the divested business and potential for additional proceeds if Platinum later sells the division. The company also expects to retain more than $150 million in tax assets from the transaction. Despite these financial benefits, investors reacted cautiously, with the company's stock price dropping nearly 10% following the announcement.</p><p>The transaction remains subject to regulatory approval, including review under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act. Owens & Minor has engaged Citi and Wells Fargo as financial advisers, with Kirkland & Ellis providing legal counsel. The company plans to provide further details during its third-quarter earnings release on October 31.</p><p>This strategic shift positions Owens & Minor to capitalize on the growing demand for home-based healthcare, a market expected to expand as aging populations and post-pandemic trends drive care outside traditional facilities. The company's transformation from distributor to patient-centric provider represents a calculated bet on a smaller but potentially more profitable future in the evolving healthcare landscape.</p>
