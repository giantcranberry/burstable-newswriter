<p>The Yiwu Global Digital Trade Center is preparing for its grand opening this autumn, marking a transformative moment in international commerce that combines technological innovation with deeply personal cross-border relationships. Over the past month, thousands of merchants have spontaneously launched the "A Golden Autumn Invitation Across a Thousand Miles" campaign, blending human warmth with technological power to convey Yiwu's openness to global partners.</p><p>In this wave of spontaneous exchanges, 100 Yiwu business leaders have become emotional hubs of connection, transforming their stories of international cooperation into micro-dramas that have resonated across social media platforms. Chen Meijun invited her "foreign godson," a young man from Uzbekistan who came to China to pursue traditional Chinese medicine studies with her assistance. Sheng Yafang reached out to Sultan, a business partner from Uzbekistan whom she befriended 25 years ago through an act of honesty, rekindling a cross-border friendship rooted in integrity.</p><p>Meanwhile, Zhou Jingjing extended an invitation to her Russian partner who spent seven years repaying his debts in full despite wartime hardships, demonstrating that trust transcends borders. Xu Hua's South American client, Marcos, who once prepaid for goods without hesitation during early business dealings, will personally lead a team of nail art trainees to Yiwu for the grand opening celebrations.</p><p>Technology has emerged as another cornerstone of the digital trade center's opening campaign. The <a href="https://www.thechinagoods.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Chinagoods AI (CGAI) technology platform</a> has initiated what merchants describe as a "visual content revolution." At the recent "Global Digital Trade Center 1,000 Brand TVC Premiere and AI Social Media Marketing Summit," a thousand AI-generated brand commercials were unveiled simultaneously, overcoming traditional barriers of cost, production time, and creative limitations in video content creation.</p><p>"In the past, producing a brand video could cost hundreds of thousands of yuan and take several months. Now, with AI technology, a single product image can generate ad content with an international look and feel," explained one participating merchant. The system enables rapid creation of region-specific content tailored to visual preferences across European, North American, Middle Eastern, and Southeast Asian markets, achieving what developers call "one click, global reach."</p><p>Two AI-generated creative videos have gained significant traction on overseas social media platforms. "To the Summit" uses Mount Everest imagery to depict Yiwu's new generation of digital traders launching the "Global Digital Trade Crystal" to connect international digital trade networks. "Breaking Boundaries" features an AI-generated hot air balloon carrying Yiwu's young entrepreneurs across global landmarks including the Egyptian Pyramids, Eiffel Tower, Silicon Valley, and Sydney Opera House, extending multilingual invitations to "Come to Yiwu to do global business." The video surpassed 3.9 million views within one day of release, becoming a viral case study in cross-border digital marketing.</p><p>The Yiwu Global Digital Trade Center represents not only the next generation of markets but also a "digital trade infrastructure" powered by AI as its core engine. As a national strategic-level project focusing on fashion accessories, smart home products, collectible toys, outdoor leisure, and consumer electronics, the center features 3,760 innovative shops aimed at establishing a fully digitized, round-the-clock operational "intelligent trade ecosystem." Here, the integration of people, products, marketplaces, and supply chains is fully digitized, rendering language, time zones, and geographic boundaries no longer obstacles to trade.</p><p>"We are committed to empowering every small and medium-sized merchant with the 'content creativity' and 'brand communication power' that once belonged exclusively to international major brands," stated the CGAI project lead. The opening ceremony will feature international exchange events including a welcome gala for global buyers, new product launch live festivals, and AI interactive experience exhibitions, offering visitors an immersive celebration blending technology, commerce, and culture.</p>
