<p>Quantumzyme Corp. has announced the World Intellectual Property Organization publication of its international patent application covering modified polypeptides for enzymatic synthesis of ibuprofen. The patent, published as WO 2025/093935 A1, represents a crucial advancement in sustainable pharmaceutical manufacturing technology that could transform how one of the world's most widely used pain relievers is produced.</p><p>The company previously announced the publication of its U.S. Patent Application covering related enzymatic processes, establishing broad protection for Quantumzyme's proprietary enzyme engineering platform across both domestic and international markets. These patent publications strengthen the company's intellectual property portfolio and mark significant progress toward commercializing an enzymatic process for sustainable ibuprofen manufacturing. The patented biocatalytic method enables ibuprofen production through enzyme-mediated processes designed to reduce chemical waste, eliminate harsh reagents, and enhance overall manufacturing efficiency.</p><p>This approach addresses growing environmental concerns in pharmaceutical manufacturing while potentially lowering production costs. Naveen Kulkarni, CEO of Quantumzyme Corp., stated that the patent publications validate the strength of the company's enzyme engineering technology and enhance its position for global partnerships focused on greener pharmaceutical manufacturing. The achievement allows the company to advance into optimization and pilot-testing phases while engaging with potential partners interested in sustainable and scalable active pharmaceutical ingredient production.</p><p>The patented ibuprofen synthesis builds on Quantumzyme's proprietary QZyme Workbench platform, which integrates quantum mechanics, molecular modeling, and AI-driven optimization to design next-generation biocatalysts. This technology underpins multiple enzyme systems the company is developing for sustainable, high-efficiency production of pharmaceuticals and specialty chemicals.
