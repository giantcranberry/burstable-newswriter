<p>Woofie's, the pet-care franchise offering mobile pet grooming, dog walking, and pet sitting services, is recognizing its women-owned franchises nationwide during National Women's Small Business Month. More than half of Woofie's franchise owners are women, with 43 of the brand's 67 locations owned by female entrepreneurs. The corporate leadership team also features strong female representation across key operational roles.</p><p>Co-Founder and President Amy Addington received recognition as a 'Woman of Wonder' by Franchise Dictionary Magazine in its October issue. Nominated by the publication's 450,000 readers, honorees are selected based on their franchising impact, ability to overcome challenges, and community contributions. Addington established Woofie's in 2004, launched the franchising program in 2018, and has since expanded the brand to 67 locations across the United States. The complete roster of women-owned Woofie's locations is available at <a href="https://www.woofies.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.woofies.com</a>.</p><p>Crystal Witt, co-owner of Woofie's of Greater Jacksonville with her husband Neil Dakake, exemplifies the franchise's entrepreneurial spirit. Following a breast cancer diagnosis, Witt pursued her lifelong business ownership dream to demonstrate to her children the value of building a fulfilling life. 'We have frequent interactions with local pet owners and feel like business ownership has deepened our relationship with our community,' Witt noted. 'The icing on the cake is getting to surround ourselves with pets just about every day!'</p><p>Tanya Lee, owner of Woofie's of Reston-Herndon, has significantly grown her operation to include 10 office staff, 12 groomers, and approximately 100 dog walkers and pet sitters. 'All of them come from our local community so they know the people. They know the neighbors,' Lee explained. Her franchise was recently featured in the International Franchise Association's 'Franchise Means Local' campaign and covered by <a href="https://www.franchisewire.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.franchisewire.com</a>.</p><p>Woofie's commitment to diversity extends beyond gender representation. In 2022, Entrepreneur magazine ranked Woofie's as a top franchise for Diversity, Equity & Inclusion. To reduce ownership barriers, the company offers a $5,000 Diversity Discount on franchise fees for qualified minority-owned, women-owned, and LGBTQ+-owned businesses. Prospective franchise owners can learn more at <a href="https://www.ownawoofies.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.ownawoofies.com</a>.</p><p>The brand's female leadership team includes Vice President of Operations Lydia Best, Franchise Development Manager Jill Devlin, Franchise Business Consultant Gabby Loielo, Franchise Relations Specialist Jessica Koenig, Onboarding Operations Manager Caroline Murphy, Lead National Talent Partner Jenises Negron, and Marketing Manager Kellie Notman. 'Helping women realize their dreams of entrepreneurship is really important to us at Woofie's,' Addington stated. 'Every woman who steps into Woofie's ownership strengthens our communities, creates jobs, and elevates the standard of care for pets and their people. We're proud to foster a culture where women lead, innovate, and support one anotherâ€”because when women thrive in business, everyone benefits.'</p><p>This focus on women's entrepreneurship in the pet care industry demonstrates how franchise models can create meaningful economic opportunities while addressing the growing demand for professional pet services. As the pet industry continues expanding, Woofie's approach to inclusive franchising could influence broader industry practices around diversity and community engagement.</p>
