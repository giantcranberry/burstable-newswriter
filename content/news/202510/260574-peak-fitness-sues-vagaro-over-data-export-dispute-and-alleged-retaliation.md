<p>Peak Fitness Group LLC has filed a lawsuit against Vagaro, Inc. in California Superior Court, alleging the software company engaged in fraudulent advertising and retaliatory business practices. The legal action centers on a dispute over customer payment data migration and subsequent responses to negative feedback about the company's services.</p><p>According to court documents, Vagaro advertised the ability to import customer credit card information as part of its Premium Import Service, which led Peak Fitness to adopt Vagaro's software for their business operations. However, when the fitness company later attempted to transfer encrypted customer payment tokens to Square, a PCI DSS Level 1â€“compliant processor, Vagaro refused the request despite its previous representations about data accessibility. This refusal allegedly contradicted both Vagaro's advertising claims and established industry standards for data portability.</p><p>The situation escalated when one of Peak Fitness's owners shared his experience in a review on his private X account. In response, Vagaro's Vice President of Legal, Adam Zachs, sent a cease-and-desist letter containing what the lawsuit describes as false statements intended to intimidate and silence the business. Days later, Vagaro publicly posted on social media that businesses own their client data and can export it at any time, creating what the complaint characterizes as a direct contradiction to the company's prior written statements regarding data transfer restrictions.</p><p>The lawsuit includes multiple causes of action including fraud and deceit, breach of contract, unfair business practices, retaliation and abuse of process, and intentional interference with business relations. Peak Fitness seeks damages exceeding $450,000, injunctive relief compelling Vagaro to allow lawful data transfers, and punitive damages in the millions for intentional misconduct that allegedly prevented their expansion efforts. The case also requests a judicial declaration affirming that small business owners have the right to share truthful information about software vendors without fear of retaliation.</p><p>This case highlights significant implications for businesses relying on software platforms for critical operations. The outcome could establish important precedents regarding data ownership rights, vendor accountability, and the protection of small businesses in digital marketplaces. For business leaders and technology decision-makers, the dispute underscores the importance of carefully reviewing data portability clauses in software agreements and understanding the practical realities of migrating business-critical information between platforms.</p><p>The legal action raises fundamental questions about vendor transparency and the balance of power between software providers and their small business customers. As more businesses depend on digital platforms for core operations, cases like Peak Fitness Group LLC v. Vagaro, Inc. could influence how software companies structure their data policies and how courts interpret contractual obligations in the technology sector. The case is proceeding before Judge Craig van Rooyen in the Superior Court of California, County of San Luis Obispo.</p>
