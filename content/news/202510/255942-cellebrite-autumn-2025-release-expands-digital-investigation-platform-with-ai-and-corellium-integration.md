<p>Cellebrite has announced its Autumn 2025 Release featuring substantial expansions to its Digital Investigation Platform with new integrations and capabilities spanning from evidence collection to advanced AI-powered analysis. The release represents a significant evolution in how investigative teams can process and analyze digital evidence across multiple formats and sources, potentially transforming digital forensics workflows across public and private sectors.</p><p>A central development in this release is the integration of Corellium technology through a reseller agreement established while Cellebrite advances the acquisition process. This partnership delivers powerful Arm-based mobile virtualization offerings that complement and expand the company's digital intelligence solutions. Corellium brings highly differentiated iOS, Android and IoT device analysis capabilities for security research and testing used within defense, intelligence, government agencies and enterprise customers. Multiple Cellebrite customers in the defense and intelligence sector across EMEA and Asia Pacific have already subscribed to Corellium's solutions, which enable comprehensive security research, penetration testing and malware analysis.</p><p>The expanded and reimagined Guardian suite now includes SaaS offerings for digital forensics, investigations and analytics across public and private sectors. The new Guardian Investigate solution is designed to transform investigative team operations by using agentic AI to analyze multiple evidence types including mobile data, call detail records, open-source intelligence and case files. Currently in limited production with select Cellebrite Design Partners, Guardian Investigate is scheduled for general availability in early 2026 and aims to unify all relevant investigative information in one place with workflows supporting seamless collaboration.</p><p>Additional Guardian suite capabilities include expanded third-party mobile data file ingestion and a new European Union region to support customer data residency requirements. Cellebrite also launched Guardian for enterprises and service providers to support internal investigations by efficiently reviewing collected data and locating preliminary evidence faster, reducing reliance on forensic teams. The company's flagship digital forensics solution now supports direct integration with the Guardian suite for faster and more secure time to evidence and collaboration.</p><p>Pathfinder, Cellebrite's multi-device investigative data analytics solution, now offers a new AWS GovCloud deployment option providing users with various cost-optimized configurations tailored to specific requirements in a virtual private cloud environment. This expansion enhances the platform's flexibility and accessibility for government and enterprise users requiring secure cloud deployment options.</p><p>Ronnen Armon, Cellebrite's chief product and technologies officer, stated that the Autumn 2025 Release demonstrates the company's innovation engine at full throttle and acknowledged Design Partners for helping shape Guardian Investigate into what he described as the one-stop shop for all things digital investigations powered by agentic AI. He emphasized that the addition of Corellium technology provides the industry's finest Arm-based virtualization solutions, capabilities that are generating significant interest from the global customer base.</p><p>Cellebrite's technology is used in more than 1.5 million investigations globally each year, serving over 7,000 customers worldwide in legally sanctioned investigations of child exploitation, homicide, terrorism, border control, sex crimes, drugs and other organized crime, human trafficking, fraud, intellectual property theft, financial crimes, internal investigations and eDiscovery cases.
