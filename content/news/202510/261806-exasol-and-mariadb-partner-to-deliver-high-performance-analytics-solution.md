<p>Exasol AG has entered into a strategic partnership with MariaDB plc to expand market reach and accelerate international growth. The collaboration provides Exasol with direct access to MariaDB's extensive open-source user base, which includes more than one billion software downloads, significantly increasing visibility and commercial reach particularly in the strategically important U.S. market.</p><p>Under the partnership agreement, the Exasol Analytics Engine will be integrated into the MariaDB Enterprise Platform and offered as a joint solution called MariaDB Exa (Powered by Exasol). This integration enables high-performance analytics directly on operational data, combining the strengths of MariaDB's transactional database platform with Exasol's analytics technology to deliver real-time insights from operational to petabyte-scale AI data.</p><p>Joerg Tewes, CEO of Exasol, emphasized that the Exasol Analytics Engine is purpose-built to handle demanding data workloads at an unmatched price-performance ratio, with independent benchmarks showing performance up to 20 times faster than leading cloud competitors. The integration into the MariaDB Enterprise Platform creates new opportunities to bring Exasol's analytics engine directly to MariaDB customers, enabling them to deploy a converged database solution that supports GenAI performance requirements, real-time dashboards, and complex data science while maintaining data governance and cost control.</p><p>The MariaDB Exa solution is specifically engineered for extreme scale, complex queries, and high performance on multi-terabyte datasets. When combined with MariaDB MaxScale available at <a href="https://mariadb.com/products/skysql/maxscale/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://mariadb.com/products/skysql/maxscale/</a>, the solution uses a multi-node high availability architecture to deliver query results 20 times faster than traditional OLTP databases. This tiered approach ensures MariaDB customers have the appropriate analytical solution to maximize performance and efficiency across their entire data infrastructure.</p><p>Rohit de Souza, CEO of MariaDB plc, noted that as organizations scale their AI initiatives and associated data, they require modern systems that are fast, flexible, and cost-effective. MariaDB Exa allows organizations to extract real-time insights from large operational datasets effectively and derive immediate value from transactional information without the complexity of moving data to separate analytics systems. The solution is available immediately as an add-on option to the MariaDB Enterprise Platform 2026 release, with plans to incorporate the offering into MariaDB Cloud accessible through <a href="https://mariadb.com/products/skysql/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://mariadb.com/products/skysql/</a>.
