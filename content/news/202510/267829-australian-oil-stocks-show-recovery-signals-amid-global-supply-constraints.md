<p>Australian oil stocks are demonstrating signs of potential recovery as global supply constraints and technical patterns indicate upcoming price movements. With oil trading around $65 per barrel, up from recent lows of $55, market conditions appear favorable for selective investments in the energy sector. Global market tightening combined with new U.S. commitments to refill depleted strategic reserves are driving price support. Additional pressure comes from sanctions on Russian producers and potential secondary tariffs on nations including China, Turkey, and India, which threaten to reduce available supply.</p><p>According to Wealth Within analyst Pedro Benales, both supply and demand factors support higher prices in what he describes as a tightening market with additional buying pressure from U.S. reserve rebuilding efforts. This combination of fundamental and technical factors creates a compelling environment for investors seeking exposure to the energy sector's potential recovery.</p><p>Karoon Energy demonstrates one of the most intriguing technical structures among ASX oil stocks. After a prolonged correction, the price has established firm support near $1.25, suggesting potential trend reversal. The company has formed a strong base pattern aligning with historical low-volume accumulation zones, with increased trading volume and renewed investor interest indicating early reversal signs. Next major upside targets lie at $2.68 and potentially as high as $4.80-$5.00 based on past cycle peaks.</p><p>Woodside Energy, Australia's largest oil and gas producer, continues to hold firm technical support near $20 with clean resistance structure near $27. This $7 corridor has been key since early 2024 and could define the next breakout phase. Volume has spiked around these zones, and a confirmed break above $27 could target the $38-$40 zone, signaling return to longer-term bullish momentum. The company's scale and market position make it a bellwether for the broader Australian energy sector.</p><p>Viva Energy presents an unexpected opportunity following its mixed Q3 2025 operating update. While retail fuel sales declined, refining margins surged 76%, with signs indicating stronger Q4 performance as Geelong Refinery operations normalize. The stock has built a stable multi-year base around $1.75, a level that provided support in 2018, 2021, and again in 2025. The next key resistance area sits near $2.60, leaving potential upside of more than 45% if momentum continues, with increasing participation volume suggesting institutional activity ahead of possible Q4 strength.</p><p>For investors seeking to develop technical analysis skills, Wealth Within offers comprehensive educational resources including <a href="https://www.wealthwithin.com.au/trading-courses/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">trading courses</a> that provide detailed systems to identify momentum shifts, risk levels, and ideal entry signals.
