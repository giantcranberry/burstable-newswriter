<p>Renovation Sells, a national renovation franchise managing design, construction, and financing services, has launched InstantBid, a consumer platform providing rapid kitchen renovation estimates through iPhone Pro scanning technology. Developed in partnership with RENDR, the tool represents a significant advancement in renovation planning by delivering real-time cost projections powered by LiDAR technology and supported by Renovation Sells' extensive database of completed projects across more than 35 franchise locations.</p><p>The platform directly addresses a fundamental challenge in home renovation: uncertainty about actual costs. By drawing pricing data from thousands of completed projects, InstantBid offers homeowners and real estate agents verified material and labor costs for reliable planning purposes. Amanda Valente, Co-Founder of Renovation Sells, emphasized that the tool serves as an educational resource providing clear, upfront pricing within minutes directly on users' phones, eliminating the need for initial contractor consultations.</p><p>The implementation process requires users to download the RENDR app, provide contact information and project address, then follow guided instructions to scan their kitchen using an iPhone Pro. The system generates immediate renovation estimates covering common updates including cabinet refinishing, backsplash installation, and countertop replacement. Following the scan, a local Renovation Sells team member contacts the user via email to address questions and discuss potential next steps, maintaining a personalized approach despite the automated initial assessment.</p><p>For real estate professionals, the tool provides immediate value in client consultations. Kevin Van Eck, a licensed realtor with Maverix Advisory Group, noted that InstantBid enables agents to deliver concrete data helping sellers make informed decisions to attract buyers while positioning agents as trusted advisors focused on maximizing property returns. The technology combines automation with authentic local data and support infrastructure, offering what the company describes as the only instant estimate backed by a team capable of actually executing the renovation.</p><p>This development reflects Renovation Sells' broader commitment to streamlining the renovation process through technological innovation. By integrating advanced scanning capabilities with their established franchise network, the company aims to redefine homeowner and agent expectations regarding renovation planning and cost transparency.
