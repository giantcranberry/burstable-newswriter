<p>The Massachusetts Clean Energy Center has awarded New Bedford Research & Robotics $65,000 as part of the state's Ocean Innovation Network, a comprehensive program distributing over $11 million to strengthen Massachusetts' position in global ocean technology leadership. The funding announcement occurred during MassCEC's Climatetech Corridor Roadshow Southeast stop, following sessions at UMass Dartmouth that highlighted the region's growing clean energy infrastructure.</p><p>Dr. Emily Reichert, CEO of MassCEC, appeared alongside New Bedford Mayor Jon Mitchell to emphasize the South Coast's expanding role in the Commonwealth's clean energy and climate technology ecosystem. Reichert noted that New Bedford holds particular significance for MassCEC leadership due to its historical contributions to the blue economy and ongoing offshore wind innovation efforts. The investment will specifically fund the acquisition of a Computer Numerical Control machine, a high-precision manufacturing tool that will enable startups within the NBRR ecosystem to prototype components for underwater robots and other ocean technology innovations on-site.</p><p>Mark Parsons, Executive Director of New Bedford Research & Robotics, explained that access to CNC technology not only enhances product development capabilities but also creates valuable workforce training opportunities in high-demand manufacturing skills. The advanced equipment will streamline development processes, reduce production costs, and accelerate innovation cycles for early-stage companies working in the marine technology sector. Following the funding announcement, Parsons conducted tours of NBRR's developing facility, demonstrating the center's expanding capabilities and its strategic role in supporting Massachusetts' ocean innovation community.</p><p>This investment reinforces New Bedford's emergence as a central hub for ocean innovation, clean energy development, and offshore wind technology, solidifying the city's position within America's blue economy. In a complementary development, the New Bedford Ocean Cluster received $2.13 million to expand facilities, support its Maritime Business Incubator, and install additional prototyping equipment at NBRR, further establishing the region's leadership in marine innovation. New Bedford Research & Robotics functions as a collaborative center for researchers, entrepreneurs, and companies focused on ocean-related technologies including robotics, offshore wind, and clean energy solutions. Through provision of technical resources, shared workspace, and workforce development programs, NBRR continues to shape the future trajectory of Massachusetts' blue economy while creating new economic opportunities in advanced manufacturing and marine technology sectors.</p>
