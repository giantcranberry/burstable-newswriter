<p>Sweetgrass Pediatrics has expanded its coastal reach with the addition of Inlet Pediatrics, now operating as Sweetgrass Pediatrics at the Inlet. The Murrells Inlet practice, located at 140 Bandage Court, has served local families for nearly 20 years and will continue under the Sweetgrass Pediatrics banner while maintaining its established medical team.</p><p>Dr. Amanda Drosieko, who led Inlet Pediatrics, will remain with the practice along with nurse practitioner Dawn Fox, ensuring patients continue receiving care from familiar healthcare providers. This continuity is designed to maintain trust and stability for families during the transition. The practice will operate Monday through Friday from 8:00 AM to 5:00 PM, with a lunch closure from 12:00 PM to 1:00 PM.</p><p>The acquisition strengthens Sweetgrass Pediatrics' presence in the rapidly growing Grand Strand region, providing greater convenience and coordinated pediatric services to local families. Patients at the Murrells Inlet location will now have access to expanded resources including telemedicine options, behavioral health and counseling specialists, online appointment scheduling, and texting communication capabilities.</p><p>Dr. Colleen Boylston of Sweetgrass Pediatrics emphasized the strategic importance of this expansion, noting that the addition aligns with the organization's growth along South Carolina's coast. Both practices share a commitment to exceptional, family-focused care, making the integration a natural fit for serving the community's pediatric healthcare needs.</p><p>Families at the newly acquired location will benefit from access to the full network of Sweetgrass locations across the Charleston Lowcountry, enhancing care coordination for patients who may need services at multiple locations. The expanded network is part of Sweetgrass Pediatrics' broader mission to deliver compassionate, accessible pediatric care throughout the region.
