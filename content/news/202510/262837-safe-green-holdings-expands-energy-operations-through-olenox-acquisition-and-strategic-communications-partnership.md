<p>Safe & Green Holdings Corp. has engaged IBN to enhance its corporate communications strategy as the diversified holding company expands its energy operations through subsidiary Olenox Corp. The company is advancing energy initiatives through Olenox, which focuses on acquiring and revitalizing underutilized oil and gas assets. Following the May 2025 acquisition of 111 wells across 1,600 acres from Sherman Oil & Gas and affiliates, Olenox has mobilized operations in Texas and reached production levels of 55 barrels per day.</p><p>Additional production increases are expected from well restimulations as the company continues to optimize its newly acquired assets. The strategic engagement with IBN, part of the Dynamic Brand Portfolio that includes NetworkNewsWire, aims to strengthen corporate communications during this period of operational expansion. IBN's comprehensive services include access to wire solutions via <a href="https://InvestorWire.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">InvestorWire</a>, article syndication to thousands of outlets, and enhanced press release distribution.</p><p>Complementing Olenox's energy operations, Safe & Green's modular manufacturing arm, SG Echo, is consolidating operations into a new Texas facility shared with Olenox. This co-location strategy is designed to streamline logistics and strengthen operational efficiency across both business units. The company's latest news and updates relating to SGBX are available in the corporate newsroom at <a href="https://NetworkNewsWire.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">NetworkNewsWire</a>.</p><p>The partnership with IBN represents a strategic move to enhance visibility and communication during a period of significant operational growth for Safe & Green Holdings. As the company continues to develop its energy portfolio through Olenox while maintaining its core modular manufacturing capabilities through SG Echo, effective corporate communications become increasingly important for investor relations and market positioning. The engagement provides access to IBN's broad distribution network and specialized financial communications expertise.</p><p>For business leaders monitoring energy sector developments, Safe & Green's expansion strategy demonstrates how diversified companies can leverage existing infrastructure to enter new markets. The company's approach of revitalizing underutilized assets rather than developing new fields represents an alternative investment model in the energy sector. The co-location of energy and manufacturing operations in Texas creates potential operational synergies that could serve as a model for other diversified holding companies.</p><p>The timing of this expansion and enhanced communications strategy coincides with increased investor interest in energy assets and the need for clear corporate messaging during transitional periods. As Safe & Green Holdings continues to execute its dual-track strategy of energy development and modular manufacturing, the company's ability to effectively communicate progress and operational milestones will be critical for maintaining investor confidence and market positioning.</p>
