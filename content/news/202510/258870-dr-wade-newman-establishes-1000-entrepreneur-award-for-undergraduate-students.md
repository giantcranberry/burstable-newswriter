<p>The Dr. Wade Newman Award for Entrepreneurs represents a significant investment in the next generation of business leaders, offering a $1,000 prize specifically designed to support undergraduate students pursuing entrepreneurship as a career. Established by Dr. Wade Newman, founder of Eagle Valley Family Dentistry and Lieutenant Colonel in the Air National Guard, this award embodies his lifelong commitment to service, leadership, and empowering young innovators to create meaningful change through business. The initiative comes at a time when business leaders increasingly recognize the importance of integrating social responsibility into entrepreneurial ventures.</p><p>Dr. Newman's own career trajectory demonstrates the entrepreneurial spirit this award seeks to celebrate. After earning his Doctorate of Dental Surgery from West Virginia University School of Dentistry in 2000, he built a thriving dental practice while simultaneously serving his country for over 20 years in the Air National Guard. His journey from police officer to dental professional to business owner exemplifies the resilience, adaptability, and vision required for entrepreneurial success in today's competitive business landscape.</p><p>The award criteria emphasize ethical entrepreneurship and community impact, reflecting Dr. Newman's personal philosophy of using business as a force for good. Applicants must submit an original 500-750 word essay responding to a prompt about integrating social responsibility and community impact into their entrepreneurial journey. Essays will be evaluated based on demonstrated commitment to ethical entrepreneurship, clarity of vision, understanding of social responsibility in business, writing quality, and genuine passion for creating positive community impact. This focus on socially conscious business practices aligns with growing consumer and investor demand for companies that prioritize environmental, social, and governance principles.</p><p>Eligibility requirements specify that applicants must be undergraduate students currently enrolled at an accredited U.S. college or university, maintain a minimum GPA of 3.0 on a 4.0 scale, and be U.S. citizens or permanent residents. The application deadline is July 15, 2026, with the winner announced on August 15, 2026. Students must submit their essay, academic transcripts, and proof of enrollment to the designated application email by the deadline.

By supporting students who understand that entrepreneurship extends beyond profit generation to include positive social impact, the award contributes to developing a new generation of business leaders equipped to address complex societal challenges. Dr. Newman's extensive background in both business and humanitarian service, including volunteer work with Mission of Mercy and Give Kids a Smile, informs the award's emphasis on using entrepreneurial skills to uplift communities. As Dr. Newman stated, "Throughout my career in dentistry, military service, and business ownership, I've learned that the most rewarding success comes from serving others. I'm honored to support a student who understands that entrepreneurship is not just about building a businessâ€”it's about building something that matters."</p>
