<p>Alpha Cognition Inc. has priced an oversubscribed underwritten public offering of 5.6 million common shares at $6.25 per share, generating approximately $35 million in gross proceeds before expenses. The commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company, focused on neurodegenerative disease treatments, plans to use the net proceeds to accelerate commercialization of ZUNVEYL (Benzgalantamine), including sales expansion, marketing initiatives, payer coverage development, and reimbursement infrastructure enhancement.</p><p>CEO Michael McFadden emphasized that this substantial funding will help maximize near-term adoption of their treatments while establishing the foundation for long-term growth. The offering's oversubscribed status indicates strong investor confidence in Alpha Cognition's pipeline and commercial strategy. Titan Partners Group, a division of American Capital Partners, served as sole bookrunner for the offering and was granted a 30-day option to purchase up to an additional 840,000 shares to cover potential over-allotments.</p><p>The funding comes at a critical time for Alpha Cognition as the company advances ZUNVEYL, a patented drug approved as a new generation acetylcholinesterase inhibitor for Alzheimer's disease treatment. What distinguishes ZUNVEYL from existing treatments like donepezil and rivastigmine is its active metabolite's binding to neuronal nicotinic receptors, particularly the alpha-7 subtype, which is known to have positive effects on cognition while potentially minimizing gastrointestinal side effects common with current Alzheimer's medications.</p><p>Beyond ZUNVEYL's immediate commercialization, Alpha Cognition is developing ALPHA-1062 in combination with memantine to treat moderate to severe Alzheimer's dementia. The company is also advancing an intranasal formulation targeting Cognitive Impairment associated with mild Traumatic Brain Injury (mTBI), a condition for which there are currently no approved treatment options. These developments address significant unmet medical needs in neurodegenerative care, with Alzheimer's disease affecting millions worldwide and traumatic brain injury representing a growing public health concern.</p><p>The successful funding round positions Alpha Cognition to expand its commercial footprint and advance its diverse pipeline of neurodegenerative treatments.
