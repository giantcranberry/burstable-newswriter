<p>NANO Nuclear Energy Inc. has completed a significant private placement of 8,490,767 common shares, securing approximately $600 million in new capital from leading asset managers and institutional investors. The substantial financing provides multiple years of operating runway for the company to advance development, construction, and regulatory licensing activities for its nuclear energy technologies.</p><p>Founder and Chairman Jay Yu stated that the successful capital raise reflects strong investor confidence in NANO Nuclear's position within the U.S. microreactor industry. Titan Partners Group, a division of American Capital Partners, served as sole placement agent for the offering. The company believes it represents the first publicly listed portable nuclear microreactor company in the United States.</p><p>The funding will primarily support NANO Nuclear's lead project, the patented KRONOS MMR Energy System, which is currently in construction permit pre-application engagement with the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission. The company is collaborating with the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign on this stationary high-temperature gas-cooled reactor development. Additional reactor products in development include the ZEUS solid core battery reactor and the space-focused, portable LOKI MMR system.</p><p>NANO Nuclear operates as a vertically integrated company across five business lines: portable and microreactor technologies, nuclear fuel fabrication, nuclear fuel transportation, nuclear applications for space, and nuclear industry consulting services. Through its subsidiary Advanced Fuel Transportation Inc., the company holds exclusive licensing rights to a patented high-capacity HALEU fuel transportation basket developed by three major U.S. national nuclear laboratories with Department of Energy funding.</p><p>Another subsidiary, HALEU Energy Fuel Inc., focuses on developing a domestic source for High-Assay, Low-Enriched Uranium fuel fabrication to serve both NANO Nuclear's microreactors and the broader advanced nuclear reactor industry. The company's space division, NANO Nuclear Space Inc., explores commercial applications of micro nuclear reactor technology for extraterrestrial projects, human sustaining environments, and potential propulsion systems for long-haul space missions, with initial focus on cis-lunar applications.
