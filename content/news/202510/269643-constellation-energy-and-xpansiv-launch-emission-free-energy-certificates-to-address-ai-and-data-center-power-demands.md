<p>Constellation Energy Corporation and Xpansiv announced plans to launch clean energy-based annual emission-free energy certificates on an online trading platform, creating new market mechanisms to support corporate and institutional decarbonization efforts. Constellation will offer EFECs sourced from its clean energy centers in the PJM region on Xpansiv's CBL spot exchange beginning December 2, 2025, with plans to expand to hourly EFECs in the future.</p><p>The partnership addresses the critical need for additional carbon-free power sources as electricity demands surge from artificial intelligence applications, electric vehicles, and data center development. According to Goldman Sachs Research, global data center power demand is expected to grow 160% by 2030, creating unprecedented pressure on clean energy infrastructure. Xpansiv will further support the emission-free energy market through its North American Renewables Registry, which will issue nuclear-energy-based zero-emission certificates providing full-lifecycle traceability from issuance to retirement.</p><p>Jim McHugh, Chief Commercial Officer at Constellation, emphasized that the company's focus remains on providing comprehensive commercial products that help customers meet environmental goals. We believe the most important energy commodity is a reliable and clean megawatt, and our clean energy resources offer more clean, emissions-free energy than any other energy provider in the U.S., McHugh stated. The initiative leverages Constellation's position as the nation's largest producer of emissions-free energy, with annual output that is nearly 90% carbon-free.</p><p>John Melby, CEO of Xpansiv, highlighted the significance of the partnership in advancing clean energy markets. Additional carbon-free power sources are in critical need, and clean energy centers will play a key role in meeting the growing demand for years to come, Melby said. Our pioneering launch of clean energy certificate solutions across our registry and exchange demonstrates the power of our comprehensive environmental commodity market infrastructure.</p><p>The North American Renewables Registry represents a key component of this infrastructure, serving as a leading renewable energy certificate registry across the U.S., Canada and Mexico with more than 89 GW of renewable energy capacity. Market participants can access detailed information about the emission-free energy certificates through a webinar scheduled for Wednesday, November 12, at 10 a.m. ET, available at <a href="https://cvent.me/z2QXL7" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://cvent.me/z2QXL7</a>. The webinar will feature panelists from both companies discussing how verified, registry-issued certificates support decarbonization programs and disclosure requirements.</p><p>This market development comes as corporations face increasing pressure to demonstrate credible environmental claims and meet sustainability targets. Xpansiv's rules-based markets and infrastructure enable stakeholders to deliver transparent, credible, and auditable environmental claims to address the growing global demand for assurance and accountability on climate action. The partnership represents a significant step in creating standardized, tradable instruments for emission-free energy attributes that can help accelerate the transition to a reliable, sustainable and secure energy future.</p>
