<p>Employers across California are confronting heightened litigation risks as workplace laws continue to evolve, with wage-and-hour class actions and Private Attorneys General Act claims representing one of the fastest-growing areas of employment litigation. Michael W. M. Manoukian, Partner at Lathrop GPM LLP, emphasizes that employment law has transformed from a reactive function to a strategic business priority over the past decade, with compliance now central to risk management and operational planning.</p><p>The sharp increase in wage and hour litigation underscores the substantial financial consequences of even minor compliance gaps. Manoukian has developed expertise in defending companies against complex cases involving alleged off-the-clock work, unpaid overtime, meal and rest break violations, inaccurate wage statements, delayed final wage payments, and noncompliant time records. His preventive approach focuses on helping employers address compliance deficiencies before they escalate into claims through comprehensive audits, policy development, and targeted training for management teams.</p><p>Remote and hybrid work arrangements have introduced new compliance complexities that challenge traditional employment practices. Despite geographically dispersed workforces, employers must maintain accurate time tracking, ensure payment for all hours worked, reimburse necessary business expenses, and enforce consistent policies regardless of employee location. Manoukian assists companies in leveraging technology to streamline compliance through automated recordkeeping, expense reporting systems, and time management solutions that meet all applicable state and federal requirements.</p><p>As artificial intelligence becomes increasingly integrated into hiring and human resources processes, California is emerging as a regulatory leader in governing AI workplace applications. While AI can transform HR operations, improper implementation that results in biased or discriminatory outcomes can create significant legal exposure and reputational damage. Manoukian works with organizations to establish AI governance frameworks that balance innovation with legal safeguards, enabling employers to harness technological efficiencies while maintaining fairness and employee trust.</p><p>State-level regulatory changes continue to present challenges for businesses operating across multiple jurisdictions. Wage increases, paid leave rules, and evolving labor standards require systems capable of adapting quickly to shifting requirements. Manoukian advises clients to invest in proactive compliance audits, implement strategic documentation practices, and maintain updated cross-jurisdictional policies that meet the highest applicable standards. This approach becomes particularly critical as companies expand operations across California or into other states with differing regulatory environments.</p><p>Looking forward, several legislative developments could significantly impact California employers, including proposed bills related to paid sick leave expansion, workplace violence prevention, and noncompete restrictions. Rather than waiting for new regulations to take effect, Manoukian encourages proactive planning that assesses potential workforce cost implications, updates policies accordingly, and provides early manager training. This readiness strategy allows organizations to maintain operational continuity, preserve corporate culture, and control expenses during regulatory transitions.</p><p>The evolving employment landscape demands that employers treat compliance as an investment in operational excellence rather than a checkbox exercise. Companies that adopt proactive legal strategies can achieve measurable returns through enhanced performance, reduced litigation risk, and improved employee engagement. As workplace challenges continue to evolve—from remote workforce management to AI integration and legislative changes—employers who prioritize adaptability and strategic compliance positioning will be best equipped to navigate the complex regulatory environment while capitalizing on emerging opportunities.</p>
