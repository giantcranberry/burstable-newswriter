<p>United Franchise Group is observing the fourth annual Women in Franchising National Appreciation Day on October 14th, a company-created initiative honoring women-led entrepreneurial achievements and encouraging more women to consider the franchise industry. According to a 2024 report cited by the company, 30% of all franchise owners are women, with the top motivation being a desire to be their own boss.</p><p>Women continue to make a powerful impact in the franchising industry, and we're proud to honor their contributions with a dedicated observance day celebrating female entrepreneurs, said Ray Titus, Founder and CEO of United Franchise Group. For any woman curious about franchising—whether she's just exploring her options or getting ready to take the leap—we hope this day inspires her to discover the benefits of being a franchisee and find the opportunity that fits her best.</p><p>The company fuels the dreams of entrepreneurs around the globe, connecting them to a powerful network of seasoned experts and proven franchise systems. With over 40 years of experience, its affiliated brands and consultants offer the tools and knowledge needed to turn ambition into success.

Franchising gives me the advantage of working with an established brand, while also connecting me to a community of experts who continue to support my growth as I expand my business.</p><p>The observance day comes at a time when women's participation in franchising continues to grow, representing a significant shift in small business ownership patterns. The company's initiative aims to both celebrate current achievements and inspire future female entrepreneurs to consider franchising as a viable career path. With women now comprising nearly one-third of franchise owners, the industry demonstrates increasing gender diversity in business ownership that could reshape traditional entrepreneurship models and create new pathways for women seeking business ownership opportunities.</p>
