<p>NeuroOne Medical Technologies Corporation has significantly expanded its intellectual property portfolio with recent patent approvals from both the United States and European patent offices. The medical technology company, focused on improving surgical care for neurological disorders, received three key patent decisions that strengthen its position in the neurological device market.</p><p>On September 29, 2025, the United States Patent and Trademark Office issued a Notice of Allowance for U.S. Patent Application 17/860,232, titled "Probe Devices with Temperature Sensors and Related Systems and Methods." This patent covers novel electrode devices featuring at least one electrode contact and a temperature sensor. A Notice of Allowance indicates the USPTO's determination that a patent should be granted following examination of the application, with NeuroOne anticipating formal issuance in the coming months.</p><p>The company achieved another milestone on October 1, 2025, when European Patent 4013481, titled "Spinal Cord Stimulation Systems, Methods, and Devices," was granted by the European Patent Office. This patent covers innovative spinal cord stimulation devices with deployable electrode array bodies, representing NeuroOne's first granted patent in Europe.</p><p>Further strengthening its U.S. patent position, the USPTO issued U.S. Patent 12,435,407 on October 7, 2025. Titled "Methods for Making Probe Devices and Related Devices," this patent covers novel manufacturing methods for neural probe and spinal cord stimulation devices, including specific techniques for arranging probe components and depositing electrode contact material.</p><p>These recent additions complement NeuroOne's existing intellectual property portfolio, which includes four additional issued U.S. patents, seven pending U.S. applications, and eight pending foreign applications. The portfolio covers various thin-film electrode technologies, including both neural and spinal cord electrodes with unique structures designed to optimize functionality while minimizing device profile.</p><p>Dave Rosa, chief executive officer of NeuroOne, emphasized the strategic importance of these developments. "NeuroOne has made tremendous progress expanding our robust patent portfolio. Our goal is to continue to grow our technology platform to broader use cases and applications," Rosa stated. He highlighted that temperature control represents an integral feature of the company's <a href="https://www.neuroone.com/technology" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">OneRF Ablation System</a> that provides critical safety measures for brain ablations in patients suffering from seizures. Rosa also expressed excitement about the European patent covering percutaneously placed paddle electrodes, designed to spare patients from surgical incisions when treating lower back pain.</p><p>The expanded patent portfolio signals NeuroOne's commitment to advancing minimally invasive solutions for neurological conditions including epilepsy, Parkinson's disease, dystonia, essential tremors, and chronic pain resulting from failed back surgeries. The company's technology platform aims to improve patient outcomes while potentially reducing procedural costs through innovative electrode designs and manufacturing methods.</p>
