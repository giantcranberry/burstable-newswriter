<p>Yorkton Equity Group Inc. has finalized the acquisition of The Crystallina, a 184-unit multi-family residential complex in Edmonton, Alberta, for $46.0 million. The company removed all buyer's conditions on October 16, 2025, following extensive due diligence, with the transaction scheduled to close on January 15, 2026. This acquisition marks another significant step in Yorkton's expansion within Edmonton's rental market, following recent purchases of The Dwell and The Fuse properties.</p><p>The property financing includes a Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation insured mortgage of approximately $44.3 million, secured through a commitment letter with favorable terms including a 50-year amortization period and an interest rate capped at 4% per annum. Yorkton has already paid non-refundable deposits totaling $1,000,000, with the remaining purchase price to be funded through a combination of cash and the CMHC insured bank mortgage. This financing structure provides long-term stability and predictable carrying costs for the investment.</p><p>Constructed in 2016, The Crystallina property spans approximately 3.81 acres in the Crystallina Nera East neighborhood and consists of three condominium-quality buildings plus a freestanding amenity building. The complex offers 51 one-bedroom suites, 97 two-bedroom with one-bathroom suites, and 36 two-bedroom with two-bathroom suites, with an average suite size of 803 square feet and total net rentable space of 147,826 square feet. Each unit features premium finishes including quartz countertops, stainless steel appliances, walk-in closets, and in-suite laundry facilities.</p><p>The property's extensive amenities include 128 underground parking stalls and 150 surface parking stalls, along with a modern tenant lounge, energy-efficient solar panels, a fully equipped fitness centre, community garden, and pet run. Ben Lui, President and CEO of Yorkton, emphasized that the acquisition aligns with the company's growth strategy and is supported by strong economic conditions, continued in-migration, and attractive affordability factors in the Edmonton region.</p><p>This transaction strengthens Yorkton's portfolio of premium, condominium-grade rental properties in strategic Western Canadian markets where rental housing demand remains robust. The acquisition demonstrates continued investor confidence in Alberta's multi-family residential sector, particularly in markets experiencing population growth and economic expansion.
