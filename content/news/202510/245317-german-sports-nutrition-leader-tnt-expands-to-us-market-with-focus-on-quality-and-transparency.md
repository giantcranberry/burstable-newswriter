<p>TNT (True Nutrition Technology), one of Germany's fastest-growing sports nutrition companies, has announced its expansion into the United States market. Founded by former German national baseball player Michael Weigl and former U20 national hockey team goalie Markus Himmelstoss, the company launched in 2012 with a vision to create best-in-class sports supplements backed by independent testing and German precision manufacturing.</p><p>The company's commitment to quality and transparency sets it apart in the competitive supplement industry. Unlike many competitors, TNT has its entire product line tested by external laboratories. Certificates for nutritional content, protein verification, and microbiological safety—including tests for E. coli, salmonella, heavy metals, molds, and yeast—are published alongside each product. All TNT products are manufactured and packaged in Germany under HACCP, IFS, and TÜVNORD standards, providing assurance of transparency, consistency, and safety.</p><p>Since our first product, we have relied on independent laboratory analysis to ensure every supplement we produce meets the highest standards—not just our own expectations, but also the promises of our suppliers, said Weigl. We don't just claim quality, we prove it. This approach addresses longstanding concerns in the US supplement market about product safety and accurate labeling.</p><p>TNT products are developed using advanced processing techniques for maximum bioavailability. Enzymatic hydrolysis, for example, breaks proteins into smaller peptides and amino acids for faster digestion and absorption. The company's product innovations include their Multivitamin Powder Micronutrients—a blend of 24 essential vitamins and minerals enhanced with natural boosters such as green tea extract, spirulina, ginseng, Coenzyme Q10, and grape seed extract available at https://tnt-sports-nutrition.com/products/micronutrients. Their Vegan Basics formula provides all essential vitamins and minerals plus creatine for energy and muscle performance, while their Creatine Monohydrate Creapure® represents the world's purest creatine, made in Germany.</p><p>This combination of science-backed formulations, innovative ingredient blends, and proven effectiveness has made TNT a trusted choice for diverse consumers—from elite athletes seeking peak performance to older adults looking for preventive health support and everyday individuals aiming to improve overall wellness. The company's expansion into the United States represents a significant move in the competitive American sports nutrition market, where quality concerns and transparency issues have been ongoing challenges.</p><p>Our goal is simple, added Himmelstoss. We want TNT to become the number one trusted name in sports supplements in America—known for transparency, effectiveness, and results. Already established as a leading name in the German and European sports nutrition market, TNT aims to build brand awareness and deliver its proven supplements to American athletes and health-conscious consumers through their official website at https://tnt-sports-nutrition.com. The company expects to quickly establish a strong foothold in the U.S. market by leveraging its reputation for German manufacturing standards and independent verification processes.</p>
