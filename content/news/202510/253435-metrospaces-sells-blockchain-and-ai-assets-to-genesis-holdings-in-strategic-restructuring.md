<p>Metrospaces Inc. has entered into a Letter of Intent with Genesis Holdings Inc. to divest two of its core technology assets: MetroCrowd, a blockchain-based real estate tokenization platform, and MetroHouse, an AI-powered property management software system. The transaction, valued at $1 million in convertible preferred stock from Genesis Holdings, represents what the company describes as the first true value-based path to corporate rebuilding and signals a significant strategic shift for the publicly traded firm.</p><p>The asset sale enables Metrospaces to focus exclusively on its remaining flagship project, Abode Stays, a premium hospitality platform for high-end short-term residences across Europe and the Americas. Both MetroCrowd and MetroHouse, previously developed but never launched due to financial constraints, will be activated under the Genesis Holdings umbrella in the coming weeks according to the announcement. This strategic pivot allows Metrospaces to concentrate resources on its core hospitality business while maintaining financial exposure to the sold assets through the convertible preferred stock arrangement.</p><p>The corporate restructuring includes significant leadership alignment, with Metrospaces CEO Oscar Brito scheduled to become CEO of Genesis Holdings once the transaction closes. This leadership consolidation is designed to ensure full transparency and operational synergy between the two publicly traded companies. The arrangement creates operational clarity and cost efficiency while maintaining a united approach to executing both companies' missions in the competitive technology and real estate sectors.</p><p>For Metrospaces shareholders, the agreement marks what the company characterizes as a corporate rebirth after what has been described as a challenging journey. The convertible preferred stock provides Metrospaces with renewed access to funding and establishes what management calls a real business plan with a clear path to full relaunch. The company emphasized that it now has structure beneath its feet and is walking forward again after difficult periods, with both companies indicating their websites are currently being renewed and will launch shortly at https://metrospaces.com and https://genesisholdingsinc.com respectively.</p><p>The transaction represents a notable development in the convergence of blockchain technology, artificial intelligence, and real estate management. For industry leaders, this deal demonstrates how companies can strategically reposition themselves by divesting non-core technology assets while maintaining financial upside through convertible instruments. The activation of previously shelved blockchain and AI platforms under new ownership could signal renewed momentum in property technology innovation, potentially creating new competitive dynamics in both the real estate tokenization and smart property management markets.</p><p>The transaction remains subject to successful negotiation and closing of a definitive agreement, with the final terms expected to be disclosed upon completion. This strategic move by Metrospaces highlights the ongoing evolution in how technology companies manage their asset portfolios and focus their operational priorities in response to market conditions and financial realities.</p>
