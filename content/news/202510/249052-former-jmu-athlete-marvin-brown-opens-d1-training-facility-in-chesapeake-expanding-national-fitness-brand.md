<p>The opening of D1 Training's newest facility in East Chesapeake marks a significant expansion for the national fitness brand while bringing professional-grade athletic training to the Chesapeake community. Former James Madison University tight end Marvin Brown, who will be inducted into JMU's Athletic Hall of Fame in 2024, has transitioned from a 15-year healthcare leadership career to pursue his passion for athletics and community building through this new venture.</p><p>Located at 1011 Eden Way North, the facility employs certified trainers using sports-science backed regimens to serve clients across four distinct age-based programs: Rookie (ages 7-11), Developmental (ages 12-14), Prep (ages 15-18), and D1 Adult. Each program follows five athletic-based tenets including dynamic warm-up, performance training, strength programs, core and conditioning, and proper cool down protocols. Beyond group workouts, D1 Training offers specialized group, semi-private, and one-on-one training sessions with world-class coaches.</p><p>Brown joins an impressive roster of D1 franchisees that includes professional athletes like Kylie Fitts and Jordan Gay, with additional brand partners including NBA star Chris Paul and Heisman Trophy winner Tim Tebow. The Chesapeake expansion represents part of D1 Training's strategic national growth through franchising, with the brand now operating more than 150 facilities and over 100 additional locations in various development stages.</p><p>According to Dan Murphy, D1 Training's Chief Operating Officer, the Browns and Clelland represent ideal candidates to bring the D1 experience to Chesapeake. The brand is actively seeking financially qualified business builders, former athletes, and entrepreneurs who share a passion for fitness and youth sports, with franchise information available at <a href="https://www.d1franchise.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.d1franchise.com/</a>.</p><p>Brown emphasized that D1 stands apart from traditional gyms by serving as a training ground that builds character, discipline, and confidence alongside physical fitness. While D1 Training is known as 'The Place of Athlete,' Brown aims to establish D1 Chesapeake as 'the Home of the Athlete' where individuals can develop physically, mentally, and spiritually.</p><p>The Chesapeake expansion represents a family affair, with Brown partnering with his brother Donnell Brown, head football coach at Hickory High School, and longtime friend Leland Cleland, a former Hickory High teammate. Together they'll operate under the unified brand 'D1 Chesapeake,' with Cleland planning to open a second location in West Chesapeake in late 2025 or early 2026. Brown's wife Ardaith and their three children are also involved in building community around the new facility.</p><p>This expansion reflects broader trends in the fitness industry toward specialized, science-backed training programs that cater to specific age groups and athletic goals. For business leaders and entrepreneurs, D1 Training's successful franchise model demonstrates the growing market for premium athletic training services that combine professional coaching with character development. The brand's rapid expansion to over 150 locations indicates strong consumer demand for structured athletic development programs that serve both youth and adult populations.</p>
