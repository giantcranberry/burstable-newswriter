<p>D1 Training has revealed an enhanced structured path to ownership designed to help franchise owners launch confidently and grow with purpose. The approach provides clarity, consistency, and support throughout every step of the franchise journey through a defined sequence of strategic stages supported by resources, hands-on training, and community-driven integration.</p><p>The D1 Training path to ownership is a strategic, six-phase journey that provides structure and ongoing guidance from the first inquiry through long-term operations. Each stage is designed to empower franchisees to make informed decisions, beginning with Exploration & Discovery where prospective owners engage in discovery calls, connect with existing franchisees, and participate in Discovery Day to experience the brand culture firsthand.</p><p>Following the discovery process, franchise candidates complete Validation & Commitment with current owners and finalize agreements, joining a network of mission-driven entrepreneurs. D1's development team works closely with each candidate to ensure alignment with the brand's values, goals, and growth vision. During Site Selection & Facility Development, owners leverage data-driven market analytics to identify high-potential locations with guidance from D1's real estate and construction teams.</p><p>Prior to opening, new owners and general managers attend D1's immersive Operator Training at the home office. This comprehensive program covers business operations, sales and marketing systems, and the five tenets of athletic-based training dynamic warm-up, performance, strength, core and conditioning, and cool down. The Pre-Sales & Community Integration phase provides detailed playbooks and marketing tools to help owners build early awareness through grassroots outreach, local partnerships, and brand activation events.</p><p>Beyond the grand opening, franchisees receive ongoing operational guidance through Regional Business Coaches, access to marketing platforms, and continued collaboration across the D1 network.
