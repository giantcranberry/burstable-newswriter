<p>The corporate landscape shifted for Innovative MedTech, Inc. as the company announced its official rebranding to AnTix Holdings, Inc., marking a fundamental change in business strategy from medical technology to entertainment ticketing solutions. This transformation represents a complete pivot from the company's previous medical focus toward what management describes as meaningful opportunities in the growing online ticketing sector.</p><p>Michael J. Friedman, President and CEO of the newly named AnTix Holdings, explained the strategic rationale behind the dramatic shift. Through this rebranding, we are expanding into the growing online ticketing and entertainment technology sector, where we see meaningful opportunities to apply artificial intelligence and Web 3.0 tools to improve the ticketing and live experience for consumers and partners alike, Friedman stated. He emphasized that the company's ticketing technology has already begun generating revenues, providing what he characterized as a strong foundation for our next phase of growth.</p><p>The corporate name change became official on September 19, 2025, when the company filed a Certificate of Amendment with the State of Delaware to change its corporate name from Innovative MedTech, Inc. to AnTix Holdings, Inc. While the company's common stock continues to trade under the ticker symbol IMTH for now, management has indicated plans to file with FINRA to effectuate both the name change and a new ticker symbol. Current stockholders need not take any immediate action, as outstanding stock certificates remain valid despite the corporate rebranding.</p><p>According to the company's official description available at <a href="https://www.antixholdings.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.antixholdings.com</a>, AnTix Holdings positions itself as a technology company that delivers artificial intelligence to online ticketing, with a mission to bring transparency, efficiency and personalization to the ticketing and entertainment industry. The strategic shift represents a complete departure from the company's previous medical technology orientation, though the company maintains its exclusive licensing arrangement for the Oral Thrush application of Shear Kershman Labs' BioViscidâ„¢ bio-adhesive encapsulation.</p><p>Friedman outlined the company's broader strategic vision, noting that their goal is to build value through innovation, execution and acquisition in a market that is ripe for significant technological change. The CEO expressed enthusiasm about the transition and emphasized the company's focus on strengthening its market position while increasing shareholder value. The rebranding and strategic pivot come at a time when the entertainment and ticketing industries are experiencing rapid technological evolution, creating what company leadership believes are substantial opportunities for AI-driven solutions that can transform how consumers purchase tickets and experience live events.</p>
