<p>Adamera Minerals Corp. will offer its Talisman Copper-Silver-Tungsten Property for joint venture, presenting a strategic opportunity in critical minerals development at a time of increasing geopolitical focus on secure supply chains. The property near Laurier, Washington includes the historic Talisman tungsten mine, which served as a key tungsten producer during World War II, supplying strategic metal for U.S. military applications.</p><p>Tungsten has gained recognition as a critical mineral by multiple nations including the United States, European Union, Canada and United Kingdom due to its essential role in ballistics, aerospace and technology applications. The United States has not seen commercial tungsten mining since 2015, with most global supplies currently sourced from China, creating strategic vulnerabilities in critical supply chains.</p><p>Mark Kolebaba, President and CEO of Adamera Minerals Corp., emphasized that the Talisman Property represents a critical minerals opportunity containing a polymetallic mineralized system with tungsten, copper, silver, lead, zinc and bismuth observed at shallow depths. Exploration has demonstrated that the mineralizing system extends well beyond the old tungsten mine workings, with clear potential for discovering a much larger polymetallic deposit.</p><p>Historical documentation from <a href="https://Tungsten Deposits of Washington" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Tungsten Deposits of Washington</a> reports grades of 0.35–1.0% WO₃ at the property, with local samples assaying even higher. Scheelite, the primary tungsten mineral, occurs in garnet-epidote skarn along the contact between limestone and intrusive rocks. Beyond tungsten potential, smelter records from the Talisman Mine reveal high-grade copper and silver averaging 5% and 103 g/t respectively, with specific zones containing lead up to 20% and zinc up to 11%.</p><p>Recent exploration work has revealed significant findings beyond the historic mine boundaries. Surface sampling, mapping, and geophysical interpretation demonstrate that copper, silver, zinc and lead mineralization extends well beyond the historic mine, suggesting tungsten may follow similar patterns. Recent exploration highlights several significant metal values located 700 to 1500 metres from the mine, including zones with elevated tungsten (100 to 2600 ppm) and bismuth (100 to 2850 ppm) that remain untested.</p><p>The geological setting features carbonate rocks intruded by granite and diorite bodies, forming extensive skarn alteration along contact zones. Adamera's mapping has outlined a 1.5-kilometre mineralized corridor with copper-silver-lead-zinc plus/minus tungsten occurrences, multiple magnetic anomalies coinciding with surface mineralization, and continuity of alteration beyond historic mine workings. The company believes the skarn system remains open along strike and at depth, with significant untested potential beneath a likely barren rock unit.</p><p>A comprehensive exploration program has been prepared, including drilling to test below and along strike of the former mine workings, targeting both high-grade scheelite zones and associated copper-silver-bearing sulphides. Additional work will include systematic soil and rock geochemistry focusing on tungsten and detailed electromagnetic survey. The Talisman Property represents one of the few known past-producing tungsten sites in Washington State, now positioned for potential re-development under modern critical-minerals initiatives.</p><p>The combination of historical tungsten production and newly identified copper-silver enrichment positions Talisman as a strategic exploration asset in a geopolitically secure jurisdiction. This development comes at a crucial time when Western nations are actively seeking to reduce dependence on foreign critical mineral supplies, particularly those with defense and technology applications. The property's polymetallic nature offers potential economic advantages through multiple revenue streams, while its location in Washington State provides regulatory stability and established infrastructure.</p>
