<p>Studio Samuel Girls Academy is marking its tenth anniversary with the launch of Yewer Abeba, a free menstrual health educational app created by Ethiopian girls to combat one of the leading causes of school absenteeism among adolescent girls in the country. The app debuts on October 11, 2025, coinciding with International Day of the Girl, whose theme directly aligns with the student-led initiative.</p><p>Yewer Abeba, which translates to "Monthly Flower" in Amharic, represents a significant approach to menstrual health education by putting creation and leadership in the hands of the girls it serves. One student currently in Studio Samuel Girls Academy explained, "Periods used to mean I would miss class. With Yewer Abeba, I feel prepared. The girl I am is a student, and the change I lead is showing my sisters and classmates that we belong in school every day."</p><p>The app addresses a critical educational barrier in Ethiopia, where menstruation remains a primary reason girls miss school. Available for free download on <a href="https://play.google.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Google Play</a> beginning October 11, Yewer Abeba reaches approximately 95% of mobile users in Ethiopia who utilize Android devices. The app features content in Amharic, Tigrinya, Afaan Oromo, and English, ensuring cultural relevance and broad accessibility across diverse Ethiopian communities.</p><p>Developed through collaboration between Studio Samuel Girls Academy students and licensed medical experts, with research support from Dr. Kathryn Geurts and Global Health students at Hamline University, Yewer Abeba includes practical features such as a period tracker, health resources, and a Kalkidan avatar based on the organization's menstrual health management ambassador. The app operates without requiring wifi after download and prioritizes user privacy by not collecting personal data, addressing concerns raised by caregivers and parents during development.</p><p>Tamara Horton, Founder and Executive Director of Studio Samuel Girls Academy, emphasized the app's significance, stating, "No girl should have her education disrupted by something as natural as her period. Our menstrual education app—created for girls, by girls and shaped with their families and medical experts—puts knowledge and dignity in their hands." The app is powered by <a href="https://makeadifference.tech" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">MakeADifference.tech</a> and builds upon Studio Samuel's proven model of pairing education with health and skills training for long-term empowerment.</p><p>The launch comes during Studio Samuel's milestone tenth year of operation in Ethiopia, during which the organization has impacted 25,000 girls with critical life skills through its Training for Tomorrow program. The organization recently rebranded as Studio Samuel Girls Academy to more clearly reflect its commitment to girls' education and empowerment, with an ambitious goal to reach one million girls by 2035. This student-led menstrual health initiative demonstrates how the organization continues to equip girls with tools to create lasting change for themselves and their communities.</p>
