<p>LaFleur Minerals Inc. has expanded its international market presence with the listing of its shares on the Tradegate Exchange in Berlin, Germany. This strategic move provides the company with access to one of Europe's most active investor-focused platforms, enhancing its global shareholder base and connectivity with international investors during a critical phase of corporate development.</p><p>The Berlin listing represents a significant milestone for LaFleur Minerals as the company advances from exploration activities to becoming a fully integrated gold producer at its Beacon Gold Mill in Quebec's Abitibi Gold Belt. Importantly, this expansion into European markets does not involve the issuance of new shares or dilution to existing shareholders, maintaining the current capital structure while broadening the company's investor reach.</p><p>The Tradegate Exchange listing complements LaFleur's primary listing on the Canadian Securities Exchange and provides additional visibility, liquidity, and market access that could prove valuable as the company develops its district-scale gold projects. This European market presence comes at a pivotal time for LaFleur, which is focused on advancing its resource-stage Swanson Gold Project and the Beacon Gold Mill near Val-d'Or, Qu√©bec.</p><p>The Swanson Gold Project encompasses approximately 18,304 hectares and includes multiple gold and critical metal prospects previously held by established mining companies including Monarch Mining, Abcourt Mines, and Globex Mining. The company has recently consolidated a substantial land package along a major structural break that hosts the Swanson, Bartec, and Jolin gold deposits, along with several other mineral showings.</p><p>Accessibility remains a key advantage for the Swanson Gold Project, with road access providing direct connections to several nearby gold mills, enhancing the project's development potential. The company's fully-permitted and refurbished Beacon Gold Mill represents another strategic asset, capable of processing over 750 tonnes per day and being considered for processing mineralized material from Swanson as well as potential custom milling operations for other nearby gold projects.</p><p>Investors seeking additional information about LaFleur Minerals can access the latest news and updates in the company's newsroom at <a href="https://ibn.fm/LFLRF" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://ibn.fm/LFLRF</a>. The Tradegate Exchange listing positions LaFleur Minerals to better capitalize on European investment interest as it progresses toward production status in one of Canada's most established gold mining regions.</p>
