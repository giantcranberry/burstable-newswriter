<p>goGlow, the award-winning sunless tanning and skincare franchise, has opened its first California location in Sherman Oaks, marking a significant expansion for the company and introducing Southern California to its luxury, skin-focused approach to sunless tanning. The Sherman Oaks flagship represents a major milestone in goGlow's national growth strategy and positions the brand at the center of Los Angeles' beauty and wellness culture.</p><p>The company has disrupted traditional spray tanning by combining skincare science with luxury service and transparency. Unlike conventional tanning salons, goGlow treats each client's skin as the foundational canvas, offering odorless, non-sticky, non-orange, plant-based formulations along with customized color consultations, pH balancing sprays, and moisture-locking finishes. Founder and CEO Melanie Richards emphasized that the company believes a beautiful tan should start with healthy skin, creating an experience where clients receive education, skincare care, and a natural-looking glow.</p><p>The Sherman Oaks location distinguishes itself through several key features including premium clean formulas that are vegan, cruelty-free, and free from parabens and sulfates. Each client works with a skin specialist to choose their ideal hue, minimizing guesswork and achieving tailored results. The salon offers flexible rinse options with rapid rinsing available after 3-5 hours or traditional rinsing after 12-24 hours, depending on desired color depth.</p><p>The physical space features sleek, modern interiors designed to feel like a spa rather than a traditional tanning booth. Clients can choose from VIP or Elite membership plans that provide discounted services and retail savings, while goGlow specialists educate clients on skin preparation, tan maintenance, and prolonging results as part of a comprehensive glow strategy. To celebrate the opening, goGlow will host an exclusive launch event on December 5, 2025, featuring ribbon-cutting ceremonies, live demonstrations, mini glow sessions, and special membership offers.</p><p>The arrival of goGlow in Los Angeles addresses the city's demand for radiant, healthy skin year-round while overcoming common issues associated with traditional spray tanning such as unwanted odors, streaking, orange tones, and harsh chemicals. By positioning itself in Sherman Oaks, goGlow aims to serve not only the local community but also draw clientele from across the San Fernando Valley and surrounding areas, signaling a new era for sunless tanning in Southern California where luxury, skin integrity, and science coexist.
