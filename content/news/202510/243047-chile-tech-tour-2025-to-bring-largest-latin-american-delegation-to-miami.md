<p>Hispanic Target Magazine features Claudia Serrer, Trade Commissioner of ProChile in Miami, highlighting her leadership in organizing the Chile Tech Tour 2025 scheduled for October 6 to 10 in Miami. The initiative represents the largest delegation from Latin America this year, bringing together 17 Chilean startups showcasing innovative solutions across three key technology sectors: FinTech, HealthTech, and EdTech.</p><p>The comprehensive program includes business roundtables, investor meetings, accelerator sessions, and visits to local tech incubators designed to create strategic connections between Chilean innovation and Miami's rapidly growing technology ecosystem. Claudia Serrer emphasized Miami's unique position as a natural meeting point for Latin American talent, noting that the city offers not only geographic proximity but also a multicultural environment that facilitates startup integration into the U.S. market.</p><p>Participation growth demonstrates Miami's increasing importance as a strategic hub for Chilean entrepreneurship. We started with a prospecting visit, then five companies participated, and this year we reached 17. This confirms that Miami is the strategic entry and development point for Chilean entrepreneurship and innovation, Serrer stated. The steady expansion from initial exploratory visits to the current 17-company delegation underscores Miami's established role as the primary gateway for Chilean technology companies seeking U.S. market access.</p><p>While acknowledging other technology hubs like New York, San Francisco, and Austin as important markets, Serrer positions Miami as the ideal starting point for Latin American companies. Each state has its own characteristics. Miami is perfect to begin with, as it connects with Latin America and Europe while offering an open and expanding ecosystem. From here, many companies can later scale into more specialized markets such as California or Texas, she explained. This strategic approach allows Chilean startups to establish a foothold in the familiar cultural environment of Miami before expanding to more specialized or competitive markets elsewhere in the United States.</p><p>For entrepreneurs hesitant about entering the competitive U.S. market, Serrer offers clear guidance: The invitation is to leverage all the networks and tools available in Miami. The U.S. is a competitive but opportunity-rich market. What matters most is exploring responsibly and daring to take the first step. This year's Chile Tech Tour reinforces Chile's commitment to innovation and internationalization while establishing Claudia Serrer as a key figure connecting Santiago and Miami and positioning Chilean startups on the global technology stage.</p>
