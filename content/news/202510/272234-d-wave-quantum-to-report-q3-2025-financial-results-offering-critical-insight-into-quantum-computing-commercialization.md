<p>D-Wave Quantum Inc. (NYSE: QBTS) will release its financial results for the third quarter of fiscal year 2025 ended September 30, 2025 on Thursday, November 6 before market open. The announcement represents a significant benchmark for investors monitoring the commercial quantum computing sector's development and financial sustainability. The company will host a conference call on November 6, 2025, at 8:00 a.m. Eastern Time to discuss the financial results and business outlook, featuring participation from Chief Executive Officer Dr. Alan Baratz and Chief Financial Officer John Markovich.</p><p>D-Wave's position as the world's first commercial supplier of quantum computers and the only company building both annealing and gate-model quantum computers makes its financial performance particularly significant for the emerging quantum technology industry. The company's quantum computers feature quantum processing units with sub-second response times and can be deployed on-premises or accessed through their quantum cloud service, which offers 99.9% availability and uptime. The financial results press release will be available on the D-Wave Investor Relations website at https://ir.dwavesys.com/.</p><p>With more than 100 organizations trusting D-Wave with computational challenges and over 200 million problems submitted to their quantum systems to date, the company's financial results will provide critical insight into how quantum computing is transitioning from experimental technology to commercial application. Customers apply D-Wave's technology to address use cases spanning optimization, artificial intelligence, research and more, making the company's financial health an important indicator of the broader quantum computing market's maturity. The full press release can be viewed at https://ibn.fm/XiwV7, while additional information about D-Wave's quantum computing solutions is available at https://www.dwavequantum.com/.</p><p>The implications of D-Wave's financial performance extend beyond the company itself to the entire quantum computing ecosystem. As businesses increasingly explore quantum solutions for complex optimization problems and AI applications, D-Wave's commercial success or challenges will signal the technology's readiness for mainstream enterprise adoption. The results will help business leaders assess whether quantum computing is approaching the inflection point where it becomes a practical tool for solving real-world business problems rather than remaining primarily a research and development investment.</p><p>For technology executives and investors, D-Wave's financial reporting provides one of the few publicly available metrics for evaluating the commercial progress of quantum computing technology. The company's forward-looking statements are subject to various risks and uncertainties as detailed in their SEC filings, including factors beyond management's control that could affect actual results. Nevertheless, the upcoming earnings report offers valuable data points for assessing whether quantum computing is moving closer to delivering on its promise of solving computational problems beyond the reach of classical computers.</p>
