This year marks the 10th anniversary of the Ocean Exchange Collegiate Awards program, with all finalists representing U.S. universities and post-secondary institutions. The competing teams present solutions spanning multiple critical environmental categories including ocean sensors, biodiversity measurement, plastic alternatives, aquaculture and fishery management, robotics, and artificial intelligence applications.</p><p>Finalist teams include Bioluminescence from Cape Cod Community College/WHOIHBS Lab, UTD from University of Texas Dallas, Ignition Packaging from University of Florida, MADEIN U.S.T.A. LLC from Georgia Southern University, OctaPule from Carnegie Mellon University, SLA Robotics from North Carolina State University, SWPT from University of Rhode Island, and The Leatherback Project from University of Central Florida. Winners will be selected based on the impact, innovation level, and execution capability of their presented solutions by delegates representing business, academia, government, and nonprofit sectors.</p><p>The awards program includes the Guy Harvey Foundation Award and two Ocean Exchange Collegiate Awards, each carrying a $10,000 prize. Millicent Pitts, CEO of Ocean Exchange, emphasized the program's significance, stating that these awards are wildly popular with our ocean community, not just about the student-led innovation but about the ability to personally engage with and be inspired by the next generation.
