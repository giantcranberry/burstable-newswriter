<p>McEwen Inc. has amended and refiled its technical report on the Fox Complex mineral resources in Ontario, Canada, following a review by the Ontario Securities Commission. The company refiled its NI 43-101 Technical Report on the Mineral Resources Estimate of the Fox Complex after the regulatory review identified areas requiring additional disclosure. The original report was filed on April 4, 2025, as part of the company's continuous disclosure obligations.</p><p>The updated technical report now includes additional information required under Items 16 to 22 of Form 43-101F1 for advanced properties. These additional disclosures provide more comprehensive information about the mineral resource estimate, though the company emphasized that the actual mineral resource statements for the Fox Complex remain unchanged. The refiling also involved replacing John Ryan Cox as a co-author to ensure full compliance with Qualified Person requirements under Canadian securities regulations.</p><p>This regulatory compliance action demonstrates the critical importance of maintaining accurate and complete technical documentation in the mining sector. The Ontario Securities Commission's continuous disclosure program regularly reviews such technical reports to ensure they meet stringent requirements for investor protection. Companies operating in the mining sector must ensure their technical reports comply with National Instrument 43-101 standards, which govern the disclosure of scientific and technical information concerning mineral projects.</p><p>McEwen's shares trade on both the New York Stock Exchange and Toronto Stock Exchange under the symbol MUX, making regulatory compliance essential for maintaining listing standards and investor confidence. The company's news and updates are available in its <a href="https://ibn.fm/MUX" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">newsroom</a>, providing investors with access to current corporate information. The full press release detailing the technical report refiling can be viewed at <a href="https://ibn.fm/7Ujah" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">this location</a>.</p><p>The Fox Complex represents one of McEwen's key mining assets in Canada, alongside operations in the United States and Argentina. While the technical adjustments do not affect the reported mineral resources, they highlight the regulatory scrutiny that mining companies face when disclosing technical information to investors. Such compliance measures help maintain market integrity and ensure that investors receive complete and accurate information about mineral resource estimates, which is crucial for informed investment decisions in the resource sector.</p><p>For business leaders and investors in the mining industry, this development underscores the ongoing importance of regulatory compliance and transparent disclosure practices. The incident serves as a reminder that even established mining companies must maintain vigilance in their reporting standards, as regulatory bodies continue to enhance their oversight of technical disclosures. This increased scrutiny ultimately benefits the entire investment community by ensuring that mineral resource estimates are presented with the necessary context and supporting information.</p>
