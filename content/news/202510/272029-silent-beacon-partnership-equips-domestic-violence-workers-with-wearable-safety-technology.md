<p>Washington D.C.'s oldest domestic violence organization, My Sister's Place, has partnered with Maryland-based Silent Beacon to equip its staff with wearable safety devices that can call 911 and share live GPS location with a single button press. The technology provides critical protection for staff members who regularly work in shelters, conduct home visits, and engage in community outreach with domestic violence survivors.</p><p>Krista McDaniel, Interim Executive Director of My Sister's Place, emphasized the importance of the technology for staff working in high-risk situations. "At My Sister's Place, our staff works with survivors of domestic violence every day; in shelters, in the community, and often in challenging or high-risk situations," McDaniel stated. "It's critical that our team can reach help the moment a problem arises, because every second matters in an emergency. Silent Beacon's wearable panic button provides a simple, discreet way to alert emergency contacts or 911, giving our team greater peace of mind as they carry out this vital work."</p><p>The Silent Beacon device features a "Silent Mode" that allows users to send alerts without making any sound, preventing potential attackers from realizing help has been summoned. This innovation comes at a critical time when domestic violence remains a national crisis affecting 1 in 3 women and 1 in 7 men in the United States. According to national data, 24 people per minute experience rape, physical violence, or stalking by an intimate partner, totaling more than 12 million people annually.</p><p>While most violent crime rates are declining, domestic violence incidents have increased by 3% in the first half of the year, highlighting the urgent need for enhanced safety measures. "After equipping our staff with Silent Beacon, they've said they feel more confident conducting home visits, outreach, and community work with survivors of domestic violence," McDaniel noted. "Knowing they have a discreet, reliable way to reach help allows them to focus fully on supporting survivors, rather than worrying about their own safety."</p><p>Silent Beacon was founded by entrepreneur Kenny Kelley following a personal experience where he survived a near-fatal motorcycle crash that left him unable to call for help. "Technology has the power to save lives, but only if it's simple enough to use in an emergency," said Kelley, Founder and CEO of Silent Beacon. "We designed Silent Beacon to help people feel safer and more connected, whether they're a survivor, a social worker, or someone walking to their car late at night."</p><p>The partnership represents a significant step in prioritizing the safety of frontline social service workers. McDaniel expressed hope that other organizations will follow My Sister's Place's example, stating that "prioritizing staff safety is essential" for organizations working directly with vulnerable populations. The collaboration between My Sister's Place and Silent Beacon demonstrates how technology and advocacy can intersect to protect those dedicated to protecting others in high-risk environments.</p>
