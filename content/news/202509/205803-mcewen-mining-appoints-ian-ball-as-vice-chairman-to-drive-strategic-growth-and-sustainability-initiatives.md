<p>McEwen Inc. has appointed Ian Ball as Vice-Chairman, a newly created executive position designed to support the company's strategic growth initiatives. Ball, who has served as an independent director since 2022, brings significant mining industry experience to the role, having previously led Abitibi Royalties Inc. as President and CEO, where he delivered a 74% compound annual growth rate in share price from 2014 to 2021.</p><p>In his new capacity as Vice-Chairman, Ball will focus on advancing exploration efforts, optimizing capital allocation, and identifying long-term growth opportunities. His appointment comes at a critical time as McEwen pursues its ambitious plan to double production by 2030. The company's growth strategy includes developing its <a href="https://www.mcewenmining.com/projects/los-azules" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Los Azules copper project</a> in Argentina, which is being positioned to become one of the world's first regenerative copper mines and achieve carbon neutrality by 2038.</p><p>Chairman and Chief Owner Rob McEwen emphasized that Ball's unique combination of operational expertise and capital markets experience will be instrumental in shaping the company's next chapter of growth. McEwen Inc. provides shareholders with exposure to gold, copper, and silver through its producing mines in the United States, Canada, and Argentina, along with its advanced-stage copper development project. The company also maintains a gold and silver mine on care and maintenance in Mexico.</p><p>The appointment signals McEwen's commitment to strengthening its leadership team as it pursues aggressive expansion targets. For investors seeking additional information, the company maintains a comprehensive <a href="https://www.mcewenmining.com/news" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">newsroom</a> with the latest updates and developments. This strategic move underscores the mining sector's increasing focus on both production growth and environmental sustainability, particularly through innovative projects like the regenerative copper mine concept being developed at Los Azules.</p><p>The appointment of Ball as Vice-Chairman represents a significant development for investors and industry observers, as it combines proven financial performance with ambitious sustainability goals. Ball's track record of delivering substantial shareholder value at Abitibi Royalties suggests potential for similar success at McEwen, particularly given the company's diverse portfolio of precious and base metal assets across North and South America.</p><p>The focus on the Los Azules copper project highlights the growing importance of environmentally responsible mining practices in attracting both investment and regulatory approval. The regenerative mine concept represents an innovative approach to sustainable resource extraction that could set new industry standards. As global demand for copper continues to grow, driven by electrification and renewable energy transitions, McEwen's strategic positioning with both experienced leadership and sustainable development projects positions the company competitively in the evolving mining landscape.</p>
