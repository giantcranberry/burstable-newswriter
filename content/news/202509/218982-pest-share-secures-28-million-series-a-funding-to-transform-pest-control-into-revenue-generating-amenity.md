<p>Pest Share, a pest control amenity platform designed for property managers and their residents, has closed a $28 million Series A funding round that establishes the company as a category-defining solution in the residential property management industry. The substantial investment represents a significant milestone for the company, which has expanded from its 2020 launch into a nationwide business serving over 300,000 residential units across 48 states.</p><p>According to Landon Cooley, CEO and Co-Founder of Pest Share, the platform addresses a critical industry challenge by converting pest control from a traditional expense into a revenue-generating amenity. The company's technology-centric business model automates pest control service dispatch and connects residents with a national network of vetted service providers. This innovative approach can function as a standalone solution for property managers or be offered as a premium amenity for residents, creating new revenue streams while simultaneously improving the resident experience.</p><p>The platform currently collaborates with over 700 property management companies, ranging from local operators managing 200 units to large national brands overseeing more than 50,000 properties. Major partners include industry leaders such as <a href="https://www.remax.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Re/Max</a>, <a href="https://www.roofstock.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Roofstock</a>, and ARK Homes For Rent. Cooley emphasized that Pest Share's competitive advantage stems from the founders' deep pest management expertise, with generations of industry knowledge informing their strategic approach to solving property management challenges.</p><p>Pest Share leverages modern artificial intelligence technology to deliver faster, more automated experiences for residents while providing seamless integrations for property managers. The company's national network of providers and strategic partnerships with major industry leaders serve as key differentiators as competitors begin to emerge in the space. Cooley noted that the company's success originates from its ability to comprehensively solve the pest control problem through technological integrations while driving exceptional resident experiences and delivering net operating income improvements to property managers' financial performance.</p><p>The Series A funding will accelerate continuous growth in both single-family and multifamily rental markets. Capital allocation will focus on product development, expansion of go-to-market initiatives, and development of strategic integrations with other leading industry software platforms. Cooley expressed confidence that Pest Share's innovative method of delivering pest control services will become standard across professionally managed rental housing in the near future.</p><p>For business and technology leaders, Pest Share's funding announcement signals a broader trend of traditional service industries undergoing digital transformation through AI-powered platforms. The company's success demonstrates how technology can convert operational costs into profit centers while improving customer experiences. This model has implications for other property management services and adjacent industries seeking to leverage technology for revenue optimization and service enhancement.</p><p>The property management industry, valued at approximately $100 billion annually, stands to benefit significantly from Pest Share's approach. By transforming pest control from a reactive expense to a proactive amenity, property managers can improve resident retention, increase property values, and generate additional revenue streams. The platform's scalability and integration capabilities position it as a potential industry standard, with implications for how other maintenance and service functions might be similarly transformed through technology-driven solutions.</p>
