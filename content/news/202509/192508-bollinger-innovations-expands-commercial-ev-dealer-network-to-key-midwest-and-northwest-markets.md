Company executives emphasized that these partnerships are crucial for advancing sustainable fleet transportation solutions in key regional markets.</p><p>Bollinger Innovations operates a U.S.-based vehicle manufacturing facility in Tunica, Mississippi, where it produces next-generation commercial electric vehicles.
