<p>Omer Gotlieb, co-founder and CEO of Salespeak.ai, is leading a transformation in B2B sales through artificial intelligence technology that converts static websites into intelligent sales engines. Drawing from his experience as a second-time founder who previously co-founded customer success platform Totango, Gotlieb identified fundamental flaws in traditional B2B buying processes where generic forms and sales development representatives create bottlenecks that frustrate buyers and stall revenue generation.</p><p>The company's AI Sales Brain represents a significant departure from traditional chatbots by providing real-time conversational engagement trained on comprehensive company knowledge including product documentation, customer stories, pricing information, and competitive intelligence. This technology enables 24/7 founder-level conversations that not only answer questions but also guide buyer journeys, calculate intent, and deliver actionable insights to sales teams through integrated platforms like Slack and CRM systems.</p><p>Customer results demonstrate the technology's impact, with engagement rates 3-5 times higher than legacy chat tools and conversion rates jumping from 8% to 50% for some clients. One customer generated $380,000 in pipeline through meetings booked overnight, while others gained valuable insights about campaign effectiveness, competitor mentions, and messaging gaps. The system addresses trust concerns by providing more accurate and consistent responses than inexperienced sales representatives while offering continuous monitoring and improvement capabilities.</p><p>Gotlieb emphasizes that Salespeak.ai is not positioned as a cost-cutting tool but rather as a transformation agent that changes the role of sales teams from cold-calling and form-chasing to guiding and closing deals with buyers who have already self-qualified through AI interactions. The technology prepares companies for an emerging AI-to-AI future where artificial intelligence agents will evaluate vendors on behalf of human buyers, making AI-readable website content essential for market consideration.</p><p>The company's vision extends beyond immediate revenue goals to establishing intelligent AI-powered buying experiences as essential business infrastructure, similar to how websites became indispensable decades ago. Gotlieb's category creation experience from building the customer success industry at Totango informs his approach to reshaping B2B buying through technology that prioritizes buyer experience over traditional sales processes.</p>
