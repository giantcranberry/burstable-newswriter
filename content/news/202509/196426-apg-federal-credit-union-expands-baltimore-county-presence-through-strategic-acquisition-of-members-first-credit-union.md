<p>APG Federal Credit Union has completed the acquisition of Members First of Maryland Federal Credit Union, effective August 29, 2025, marking a significant strategic expansion that enhances its service capabilities in Baltimore County. The transaction ensures uninterrupted financial services for Members First's existing member base while providing access to APGFCU's comprehensive suite of benefits, including competitive loan rates and robust financial education resources.</p><p>The acquisition adds physical locations in Dundalk and Perry Hall to APGFCU's network, significantly increasing accessibility for members throughout the region. Becky Smith, President and CEO of APGFCU, emphasized that the union represents more than a typical business transaction, describing it as a blending of cooperative principles focused on putting people first. This alignment of values between the two institutions underscores the strategic nature of the acquisition beyond mere financial considerations.</p><p>Members First members will gain immediate access to APGFCU's expanded branch and ATM network, while current APGFCU members benefit from increased service accessibility in Baltimore County. Jerry Ernest, Chairman of the Board of Members First, highlighted the philosophical alignment between the organizations, noting that APGFCU's member-first approach and community roots make the acquisition a positive development for preserving legacy services while enhancing member offerings.</p><p>The transition process ensures no immediate changes to current accounts, with both institutions collaborating to maintain personalized service throughout the integration. Future plans include the implementation of expanded digital banking platforms, further enhancing the member experience. APGFCU is providing ongoing updates through their <a href="https://www.apgfcu.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">dedicated webpage</a> to keep members informed throughout the transition process.</p><p>This acquisition represents a strategic consolidation within the credit union industry, demonstrating how mission-driven financial institutions can expand their reach while maintaining their commitment to member service and community partnership. The union of these two organizations amplifies their collective impact across the Greater Baltimore area, potentially setting a precedent for similar strategic partnerships in the financial services sector that prioritize member benefits over purely commercial considerations.</p>
