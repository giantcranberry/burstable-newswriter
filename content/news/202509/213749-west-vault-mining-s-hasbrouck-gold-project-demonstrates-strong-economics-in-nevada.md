<p>West Vault Mining Inc. maintains full ownership of the Hasbrouck Gold Project in Nevada, a fully permitted operation ready for immediate construction in a world-class mining jurisdiction. The project's 2023 Pre-feasibility Study reveals compelling economics, including a 51% after-tax internal rate of return and US$206 million net present value at $1,790 gold prices, demonstrating strong financial viability for potential development.</p><p>The mineral reserve base includes 753,000 ounces of gold across 44.02 million tons at a grade of 0.017 ounces per ton, categorized as Proven and Probable reserves. Beyond the current reserve, the company controls a substantial land package featuring multiple exploration targets that offer significant growth potential and resource expansion opportunities for future development phases.</p><p>West Vault operates with an efficient corporate structure, maintaining an annual burn rate of approximately US$1 million, which preserves shareholder value through low-cost optionality. Management and insiders hold substantial equity positions, aligning their interests directly with shareholders and long-term value creation objectives throughout commodity cycles.</p><p>The company's strategic positioning enables full exposure to gold price upside with zero near-term construction risk, allowing it to capitalize on potential bull market cycles. Following its formation after the successful C$424 million sale of West Timmins Mining in 2009, West Vault has consistently focused on opportunities in North America's most prolific gold-bearing regions, maintaining financial discipline while advancing its flagship asset.</p><p>West Vault employs a disciplined model of acquiring, advancing, and holding high-quality gold projects in premier jurisdictions, emphasizing dilution control and strategic timing of development decisions to optimize shareholder returns. The company's approach prioritizes maximizing shareholder value through low-risk, cash-conservative strategies that position it favorably for emerging market opportunities. Additional information about the company is available through its corporate communications at <a href="https://www.MiningNewsWire.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.MiningNewsWire.com</a>.</p><p>The combination of full project permitting, established mineral reserves, and strategic positioning in Nevada creates a compelling investment opportunity within the gold development sector, particularly for investors seeking exposure to gold price appreciation with minimized development risk. This configuration positions West Vault to potentially benefit from favorable gold market conditions while maintaining operational flexibility and financial stability.</p>
