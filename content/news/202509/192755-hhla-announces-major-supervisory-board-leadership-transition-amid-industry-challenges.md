<p>Hamburger Hafen und Logistik AG (HHLA) is undergoing a comprehensive leadership transition within its Supervisory Board, with Marcus Vitt appointed as the new Chairman effective October 1, 2025. Vitt, who currently serves as Chairman of the Hamburg Stock Exchange Council, succeeds Prof. Dr. Rudiger Grube, who will depart the board on September 30, 2025, after eight years of service.</p><p>Senator Dr. Melanie Leonhard, speaking on behalf of HHLA's majority shareholder Port of Hamburg Beteiligungsgesellschaft (PoH), acknowledged Prof. Dr. Grube's significant contributions during his tenure. The leadership change comes at a critical juncture for the logistics sector, which faces evolving global trade patterns and increasing demands for sustainable operations.</p><p>In addition to the chairman transition, two other current representatives of the City of Hamburg are stepping down from their supervisory roles. Andreas Rieckhof, State Secretary of the Economic Authority, and Dr. Sibylle Roggencamp, Head of the Office for Investment Management in the Authority for Finance and Districts, will also leave the board effective September 30, 2025.</p><p>The new supervisory team will include Senator Dr. Andreas Dressel, Head of the Authority for Finance and Districts, and Katharina Kriston, Head of the Central Office of the Authority for the Economy, Employment and Innovation. These appointments were made in agreement with the Nomination Committee of the HHLA Supervisory Board, with an application for court-appointment of the three new members to be submitted shortly. The company maintains information about its corporate governance at <a href="https://www.hhla.de/en" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">www.hhla.de/en</a>.</p><p>HHLA's Supervisory Board structure follows German co-determination principles, consisting of twelve members with equal representation from employees and shareholders. The City of Hamburg and MSC Mediterranean Shipping Company each hold the right to propose three Supervisory Board members, with the Chairman position traditionally nominated by the City. This governance framework ensures balanced stakeholder representation while maintaining strategic oversight of one of Europe's leading logistics companies.</p><p>The leadership transition signals a new chapter for HHLA as it navigates complex global supply chain challenges and positions itself for future growth in the evolving logistics landscape. The appointment of Vitt, described as "an expert in finance" by Senator Leonhard, suggests a continued focus on financial stability and strategic investment in HHLA's port terminal network and digital infrastructure capabilities.</p>
