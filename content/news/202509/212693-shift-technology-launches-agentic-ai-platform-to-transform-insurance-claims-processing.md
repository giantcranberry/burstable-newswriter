<p>Shift Technology has introduced Shift Claims, an agentic artificial intelligence platform designed to transform insurance claims operations. The solution assesses and prioritizes cases, guides claim handlers, and automates tasks throughout the claims lifecycle, aiming to accelerate processing, improve accuracy, and reduce claims losses and handling costs while delivering better policyholder experiences.</p><p>Historically, claims transformation has been constrained by process complexity and the uniqueness of each claim, as rules-based approaches struggle to handle the nuance and variability of real-world cases. This forces frequent human intervention even for routine tasks, slowing processes and increasing costs. Eric Sibony, chief scientist and chief product officer at Shift Technology, explained that previous technology approaches failed to address claim complexity effectively, making agentic AI a powerful transformation tool that increases automation when appropriate while providing guidance when human intervention is necessary.</p><p>The company successfully integrated generative AI into its solutions in 2024, with insurance-trained large language models proving effective at information extraction, document summarization, classification, and liability determination. Agentic AI builds on this foundation by enabling LLMs to access and utilize tools that can take autonomous, task-specific actions. AXA Switzerland has emerged as an early adopter, with COO and Head of Customer Operations Markus Keller stating that the Shift approach to agentic AI provides confidence in enabling best actions throughout the claims process, resulting in enhanced efficiency and excellent customer experience.</p><p>Designed for AI and human collaboration, Shift Claims integrates seamlessly with existing claims and core systems as an AI layer. Shift's AI agents and generative AI work alongside claims teams to assess, triage, and advise, as well as automate tasks or entire claims while insurers retain full control. Early adopters report 3% lower claims losses, 30% faster claims handling, a 60% overall automation rate, and greater than 99% accuracy in claims assessment.</p><p>The platform transforms four key areas: assessing claims complexity by reviewing documentation for coverage exclusion and liability; classifying, prioritizing, and assigning claims based on complexity and exposure; assisting and advising claims handlers with dynamic guidance; and automating claims processing and individual tasks throughout the journey.
