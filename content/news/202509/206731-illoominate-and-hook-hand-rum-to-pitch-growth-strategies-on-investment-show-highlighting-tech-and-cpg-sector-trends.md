<p>Illoominate, a parenting companion app developed by Bright Start Ed-Tech, and Hook Hand Rum, a California-based craft spirits startup, will present their growth strategies on Cheddar TV's investment pitch show Go Fund Yourself on September 11, 2025. These companies represent sectors experiencing significant transformation and consumer demand, with Illoominate targeting the parenting technology market and Hook Hand Rum operating in the competitive craft spirits industry.</p><p>Illoominate employs a dual growth strategy, targeting both direct consumer downloads and business-to-business partnerships. The platform features daily inspiration, curated blogs, interactive activities, and private reflection tools, positioning itself strategically as employers increasingly invest in family-friendly benefits to attract and retain talent. The company also partners with school systems for family support tools. Investment information is available at <a href="https://www.illoominate.net/investors" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.illoominate.net/investors</a>.</p><p>Hook Hand Rum, founded by two bartenders in Dana Point, California, represents the traditional consumer packaged goods sector in a market where the U.S. craft spirits industry has surpassed $7 billion in annual sales. The company positions itself as a premium lifestyle brand featuring blood orange and Madagascar vanilla infusions. Its growth strategy focuses on securing wholesale relationships, expanding retail presence, and gaining placement in high-traffic restaurants and bars, addressing distribution challenges common for emerging players in this competitive space.</p><p>The investment show features three experienced investors who evaluate companies based on scalability, strategy, and market timing. Rory Cutaia focuses on infrastructure and long-term vision, David Meltzer emphasizes purpose-driven positioning, and Jayson Waller concentrates on execution and operational discipline. For Illoominate, national exposure could accelerate corporate and education sector partnerships, while Hook Hand Rum could gain leverage with distributors and investors.

Illoominate must demonstrate measurable impact and enterprise adoption potential in the digital wellness space, while Hook Hand Rum needs to prove production scalability and brand differentiation in a market where hundreds of new products launch annually. The episode highlights how investment television shows provide emerging companies with visibility and access to capital while showcasing evolving market trends in both technology and traditional consumer goods industries.</p>
