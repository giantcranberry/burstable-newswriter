<p>Blue Lagoon Resources Inc. has commenced underground mining activities at its Dome Mountain Gold Project near Smithers, British Columbia, representing a critical operational milestone in the company's transition to production status. The achievement follows the company receiving its first delivery of blasting material on site and completing its initial underground blast, officially initiating active mining operations at one of only nine mining projects in British Columbia to receive a mining permit since 2015.</p><p>According to company President and CEO Rana Vig, this development positions the company to generate near-term cash flow while continuing exploration of what Vig described as Dome Mountain's district-scale potential. The mining commencement follows years of preparation and occurs without requiring further dilution to shareholders, making it particularly significant for investors seeking exposure to gold production in established mining jurisdictions.</p><p>Initial underground development and blasting operations will focus on accessing high-grade zones that were previously defined through drilling and sampling activities. In the coming weeks, mined material will be transported to <a href="https://nicolamining.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nicola Mining Inc.</a> under an existing toll milling agreement, providing an efficient pathway to gold concentrate sales and revenue generation. This arrangement eliminates the need for Blue Lagoon to construct its own processing facility, accelerating the timeline to cash flow.</p><p>The mining commencement follows the recent commissioning of Dome Mountain's water treatment plant, which was built to meet all regulatory discharge standards. The facility has capacity to treat up to 400 liters per minute, representing more than six times the current required capacity. These combined achievements demonstrate Blue Lagoon's operational readiness as it advances the Dome Mountain project toward gold production.</p><p>The Dome Mountain project holds particular significance within British Columbia's mining landscape, having received one of only nine full mining permits issued in the province since 2015. This regulatory approval, granted in February 2025, provided the foundation for the current operational phase. The company's production decision is based on existing mining infrastructure, past bulk sampling and processing activity, and established mineral resources rather than a formal feasibility study.</p><p>Blue Lagoon Resources trades on the Canadian Securities Exchange under the symbol BLLG, with additional listings on the OTCQB market as BLAGF and on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange as 7BL. The company's primary objective remains becoming a cash-flowing mining operation that delivers value to shareholders and local communities while operating within one of Canada's prime mining jurisdictions. The commencement of underground mining represents a tangible step toward achieving this goal while demonstrating the viability of smaller-scale mining operations in British Columbia's challenging regulatory environment.</p>
