<p>Downtown Burbank has experienced significant commercial growth with 10 new restaurants and retailers opening since the beginning of the year, driven by approximately 1,000 new housing units under construction or recently completed and two new hotels adding nearly 300 rooms. This expansion represents coordinated efforts between the <a href="https://www.burbankca.gov" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">City of Burbank</a> and the Downtown Burbank Property Based Business Improvement District to create an environment that attracts both unique small business owners and established brands.</p><p>The new establishments include Tigawok, Chubby Dumpling, Jam Jam Tea Studio, and Lab Lagree, with Supreme Crab, The Melt, iSmash, High Intensity Pilates, Flow Wine and Coffee, and Fire Wings scheduled to open soon. This retail expansion serves not only the growing residential population but also supports the city's workforce of 165,000 employees and increasing visitor numbers, creating a more comprehensive urban ecosystem.</p><p>First Street Village, a modern 275-unit apartment community that opened earlier this year, has become a focal point for new leasing activity with its 12,000 square feet of ground floor retail space nearly fully occupied. Tenants including Hardcore Fitness, Hollywood Pet Grooming Pet Store, High Intensity Pilates, and Flow Wine and Coffee are positioned to serve both apartment residents and the broader community, demonstrating the strategic integration of residential and commercial development.</p><p>The entrepreneurial spirit driving this growth is exemplified by ventures like Flow, a new concept by Burbank residents Vincent Tempongko and Ariel Nicastro that will feature exclusive <a href="https://www.lamillcoffee.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">LaMill coffee</a> and boutique wines. The city's economic development programs, combined with downtown events such as arts and film festivals, have created increased foot traffic and a supportive environment for business investment, fostering local entrepreneurship.</p><p>According to City of Burbank Mayor Nikki Perez, these developments represent the transformation of Downtown Burbank into an 18-hour city that balances destination retail with community-serving establishments. This urban revitalization creates a vibrant environment for residents, workers, and visitors alike, potentially serving as a model for other suburban cities seeking to develop more dynamic downtown cores that can compete with larger urban centers.</p>
