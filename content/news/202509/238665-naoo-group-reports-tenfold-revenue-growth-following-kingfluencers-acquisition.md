<p>The naoo Group reported substantial growth during the first half of 2025, with consolidated group revenue increasing to CHF 4.3 million compared to CHF 0.42 million during the same period in 2024. This tenfold growth primarily resulted from the strategic acquisition of Kingfluencers, Switzerland's leading influencer agency with more than 3,800 creators and over 300 clients. The integration has expanded the group's reach and customer network while adding stable, profitable agency revenues to the corporate structure.</p><p>Despite the revenue surge, EBITDA for H1 2025 stood at negative CHF 1.22 million, reflecting approximately CHF 0.9 million in extraordinary expenses for growth initiatives and Kingfluencers integration. Gross profit showed significant improvement, rising to CHF 1.62 million with a gross margin of 38%, more than double the 16% margin recorded in H1 2024. Net income for the period was negative CHF 1.95 million, compared to negative CHF 0.52 million in the prior year period.</p><p>The strategic combination of agency expertise from Kingfluencers with naoo's platform technology has created what company leadership describes as a unique market position. Karl Fleetwood, CFO & COO of the naoo Group, stated that the company has laid important strategic and operational foundations for future growth through this integration. The complete half-year report detailing these financial results is available at <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ePwv45XPRs7KISD9EvjCqq4vL_6zOLmj/view" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ePwv45XPRs7KISD9EvjCqq4vL_6zOLmj/view</a>.</p><p>Technological advancement formed another key component of naoo's H1 2025 progress, with the June launch of Gaia, a central data lakehouse serving as the foundation for AI applications. This infrastructure already supports naooSense 2 in the feed and a new semantic search engine, representing significant steps in the company's artificial intelligence development. The Gaia platform enables advanced features including People Matching capabilities that enhance user connectivity based on interests and preferences.</p><p>Initial collaborative initiatives between naoo and Kingfluencers have demonstrated the growing platform attractiveness, including the launch of naoo Mirror+, onboarding of creators with over 3 million followers, and the inaugural KING Awards honoring creativity and authenticity in social media. The company has also strengthened its commercial capabilities through key executive appointments, adding Gregor Doser with 13 years at Google Switzerland and Philip Hofmann with over 15 years of sales and media experience.</p><p>For the full year 2025 and beyond, naoo maintains a positive outlook and plans to continue its dynamic growth trajectory. Dr. Thomas Wolfensberger, Founder and Senior Advisor, emphasized the company's intention to maintain strong growth momentum through innovation, new features, products, and regional expansion. The adjusted four-pillar sales strategy at Kingfluencers is being supported by an expanded sales and consulting team focused on deepening customer relationships and establishing strategic partnerships with agencies.</p>
