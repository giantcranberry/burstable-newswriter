<p>Brook.ai has demonstrated how its comprehensive remote patient monitoring and care management platform helps healthcare providers consistently achieve Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set quality measures and secure associated incentive payments. The platform specifically addresses the administrative burden that often causes small practices to miss financial incentives despite delivering excellent clinical care.</p><p>The company's approach combines remote patient monitoring technology with dedicated care teams to help practices track and improve HEDIS measures throughout the year. Unlike traditional remote monitoring, Brook.ai integrates AI-powered patient engagement with human care coordination to ensure patients receive preventive care, complete necessary screenings, and maintain medication adherence. Key features include home-based blood pressure monitoring that captures and documents the two required readings under 140 mm Hg for previously uncontrolled patients directly in the EMR system.</p><p>Proactive patient outreach for preventive screenings like diabetic eye exams and mammograms supports preventive-care HEDIS measures, while medication adherence monitoring and support quickly closes refill gaps to meet medication adherence requirements. Monthly check-ins track key health metrics, identify care gaps, and flag emerging issues early, allowing practices to address problems before year-end. Care team support for patient education and engagement ensures accurate data capture and keeps patients on track with their care plans.</p><p>The platform proves particularly valuable for rural healthcare providers participating in value-based care models, including Medicare innovation programs at https://innovation.cms.gov. These providers can leverage Brook.ai's remote care capabilities to maintain quality standards despite geographical challenges and staffing limitations. University of Buffalo Medical Doctors' experience illustrates the platform's effectiveness, maintaining audit-ready HEDIS compliance for over a year with zero audit findings since implementation.</p><p>According to Kevin Hughes, MD, a primary care physician at UBMD's Primary Physicians Group, the platform has dramatically lightened the administrative load on clinical teams, freeing them to focus on patient care instead of paperwork. The success has led to expansion from a single-site pilot to three additional locations, with physicians expressing increased confidence in meeting every HEDIS measure. Oren Nissim, CEO and Co-Founder of Brook.ai, emphasized that their platform helps bridge gaps by extending clinical teams' reach through technology and human support, ensuring consistent care management while maintaining compliance with quality measures.</p>
