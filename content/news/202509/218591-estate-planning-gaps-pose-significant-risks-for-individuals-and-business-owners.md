<p>Jamie Hopkins, Executive Vice President and Chief Wealth Officer at WSFS Bank, has identified significant educational gaps in estate planning that affect both consumers and business owners. Many individuals fail to recognize how estate planning touches everyday life, overlooking critical elements like account titling, beneficiary designations, powers of attorney, and health care directives. For business owners, succession planning, tax strategy, digital assets, and liquidity planning are often neglected, creating substantial risks to business continuity and legacy preservation.</p><p>Hopkins advises people to consolidate their financial picture by getting all accounts into one view, simplifying redundant accounts, and building regular check-ins with financial advisors. He stresses the importance of coordinating investments, estate plans, tax plans, and insurance to align with personal and business goals. At <a href="https://www.brynmawrtrust.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Bryn Mawr Trust</a>, their integrated strategy brings these moving parts together, helping clients make better decisions and avoid costly gaps in their financial planning.</p><p>For business owners, Hopkins emphasizes starting succession planning early to identify future leaders, explore tax-efficient transfer strategies, and build flexibility into organizational structures. He notes that waiting until retirement or sale limits options and forces reactive planning that may not serve the business's long-term interests. This proactive approach is particularly important given the complex regulatory environment facing businesses today.</p><p>Trusts are frequently overlooked due to societal avoidance of death discussions and misconceptions that they are only for the wealthy. However, trusts offer significant protection by avoiding probate, reducing taxes, and securing succession plans. Proper use of trusts can provide control, protection, and efficiency for generational wealth transfers, making them valuable tools for businesses of all sizes.</p><p>Bryn Mawr Trust's approach is unique because it consolidates financial advisory, legal, tax, and banking services under one coordinated framework, eliminating the silos that often plague traditional financial planning. The firm's national and Delaware state charters enhance trust services, supporting special needs and legacy trusts that require sophisticated structuring. For business owners in the Greater Delaware Valley, local tax codes like Delaware's research and development refundable credit or Philadelphia's Business Income & Receipts Tax add layers of complexity that demand specialized knowledge.</p><p>Hopkins highlights that their total wealth view integrates banking, wealth, and estate planning solutions to help local businesses thrive, addressing liquidity needs and workforce dynamics to protect legacies and ensure sustainable growth. This comprehensive approach represents a significant shift from traditional piecemeal financial planning toward holistic strategies that account for the interconnected nature of modern business and personal finance.</p>
