<p>The equipment rental industry faces increasing pressure to digitize operations, with many independent companies still relying on spreadsheets, paper systems, or software adapted from other industries. FleetNow, a Cleveland-based equipment services company, announced it is developing RentalBoss, a rental management platform designed specifically for the equipment rental sector, with launch scheduled for the second quarter of 2026.</p><p>Rental yards and equipment dealers have long struggled with fleet management software that wasn't built to handle the unique challenges of their industry. FleetNow's team analyzed existing rental software including POR, Alert Rental, and RentalMan, finding that while each has strengths, most weren't designed specifically around the realities of rental yards. This leaves teams wrestling with tools that don't fit their day-to-day business operations.</p><p>Carly Cahlik, CEO and founder of FleetNow, explained the motivation behind developing new software. "At OHR Rents and IronTek we live and breathe this business and this industry every day, so we know all too well how fragmented and outdated many rental software solutions are," Cahlik said. "We couldn't find a platform that was easy to use and truly met the needs of today's rental businessesâ€”so we decided to create one."</p><p>RentalBoss is being developed with a focus on intuitive design, practical tools, and scalability. Unlike larger enterprise systems that can be difficult for smaller operators to adopt, the platform is designed to grow with a business, making it accessible for small to mid-sized rental yards while remaining adaptable to larger fleets. In addition to streamlining daily operations, the software includes reporting features that make it easier for rental businesses to track performance and use data to make smarter decisions about their fleets.</p><p>The announcement also kicks off a five-part series in which FleetNow will examine the rental software landscape, spotlighting both strengths and gaps in current tools and exploring how technology is reshaping rental operations. "The equipment industry is at a turning point," Cahlik added. "Rental businesses need technology that simplifies operations while keeping customers at the center. RentalBoss is our contribution to that shift." For more information on RentalBoss, visit <a href="https://rentalboss.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://rentalboss.com/</a>.</p>
