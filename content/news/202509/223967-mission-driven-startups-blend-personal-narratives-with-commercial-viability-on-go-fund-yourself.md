<p>The latest episode of Cheddar TV's Go Fund Yourself series featured French With an Attitude and Torques, two startups that exemplify how personal narratives can be transformed into scalable business ventures. Under the guidance of seasoned entrepreneurs Rory Cutaia, Jayson Waller, and David Meltzer, both companies demonstrated unique approaches to blending authentic stories with commercial potential.</p><p>French With an Attitude introduced Born in the Wrong Chair, a memoir addressing cultural displacement, neurodivergence, addiction, and recovery while serving as a framework for personal transformation through The Three Stages of Awareness. The project extends beyond traditional publishing through its connection to Neurodivergent With an Attitude, a nonprofit developing adaptive fashion, technology, and educational resources. This integrated approach combines content, community, and social impact, creating multiple engagement points for readers and investors.

Founded by licensed clinical social worker Scott Thomas Peterson, the company transforms familiar games into therapeutic experiences. Racquet Torques combines elements of tennis and badminton, while Torques Toss incorporates gamified scoring mechanics like Money Bird. Each product connects to a companion app that tracks performance and integrates mindfulness features, extending engagement beyond physical play.</p><p>The company's foundation in cognitive behavioral therapy principles, particularly the Thinking, Feeling, Behavior framework, distinguishes its approach to connecting physical activity with emotional regulation. Torques has developed multiple revenue streams including product sales, app adoption, curriculum licensing, video content through Torques TV, and wellness event activations.

The Go Fund Yourself platform provides participating companies with national visibility, constructive feedback from experienced entrepreneurs, and direct access to potential funders.</p><p>The series continues to differentiate itself from traditional pitch shows by combining market analysis with mentorship, helping founders accelerate growth while maintaining strategic focus. For business leaders and investors watching the program, the episode offered valuable insights into how personal narratives can be leveraged to create compelling business propositions that resonate with modern consumers seeking authentic connections and meaningful impact.</p>
