<p>Intellum has announced a strategic partnership with MadCap Software to deliver intelligent, scalable content management solutions for learning organizations. The collaboration combines Intellum's learning platform with MadCap's Create and Syndicate (Xyleme) Learning Content Management System (LCMS), enabling organizations to streamline content creation, delivery, and governance while boosting productivity and business impact.</p><p>MadCap Software provides a unified, component-based LCMS that centralizes the entire learning content lifecycle from authoring and version control to syndication and analytics. The platform available at <a href="https://www.madcapsoftware.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.madcapsoftware.com</a> allows enterprise teams to build reusable content once and deliver it across multiple channels with precision and consistency. Advanced features include AI-enhanced "Sidekick" tooling, SCORM and cmi5 compliance, xAPI-enabled analytics, and seamless integrations via APIs and LMS connectors.</p><p>"Learning content is a strategic asset. MadCap's intelligent LCMS aligns with our vision of learning as a growth catalyst," said Dan Hynes, SVP of Partnerships at Intellum.

Organizations can reuse and personalize content components efficiently while automating version control, translation, and delivery workflows. The integration also provides deep insights into content performance through xAPI Learning Record Store dashboards.</p><p>"Organizations today need learning solutions that are flexible, measurable, and built for scale," said Erin Rae Sales, Director of Strategic Alliances at MadCap Software. "Partnering with Intellum allows us to bring the power of structured content directly into a world-class learning experience platformâ€”helping customers deliver personalized learning that drives engagement and measurable business results."</p><p>The partnership addresses the growing need for integrated learning technology solutions that can handle complex content management requirements while maintaining consistency across multiple delivery channels.
