<p>The Carlsbad Department of Development will host its first Franchise Expo on October 15, 2025, at the Pecos River Village Conference Center, creating a direct connection between local investors and franchise brands seeking expansion into one of New Mexico's fastest-growing markets. The event addresses critical commercial gaps identified through a recent leakage analysis conducted with <a href="https://www.retailstrategies.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Retail Strategies</a>, a national firm that helps communities attract brands.</p><p>Jeff Campbell, Director of Marketing and Business Development, emphasized that Carlsbad's strong growth and unmet market demand provide fertile ground for franchise development. Campbell stated there are many opportunities for local investors to step up and be a part of the solution to fill in the gaps in the market as determined in part by the leakage study, aiming to keep dollars in Carlsbad while building community wealth.</p><p>The expo will feature networking opportunities alongside two educational modules covering business startup fundamentals, franchise investment considerations, and long-term success strategies. All registered participants will receive complimentary lunch during the event, which runs from 8:30 AM to 2:00 PM. Registration is free and available through the department's official website.</p><p>Kristen Gamboa, Executive Director of the Carlsbad Department of Development, explained that the initiative goes beyond simply attracting national brands. Gamboa stated the expo is about empowering local investors and entrepreneurs to seize opportunities, while giving franchise systems a direct line into Carlsbad's growing economy, with the goal to grow with franchise partners and with the community.</p><p>The department anticipates the Franchise Expo will serve as a powerful platform to attract new businesses, empower local investment, and strengthen Carlsbad's position as a commercial hub in southeastern New Mexico. The event represents a strategic approach to economic development that leverages both external franchise systems and local capital to address identified market deficiencies and retain consumer spending within the community.</p>
