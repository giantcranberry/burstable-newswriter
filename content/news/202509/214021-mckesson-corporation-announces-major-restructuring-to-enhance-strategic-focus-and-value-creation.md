<p>McKesson Corporation has implemented significant changes to its reportable segments and organizational structure, effective in the second quarter of fiscal year 2026. The restructuring is designed to enhance strategic alignment and transparency while supporting portfolio management optimization for sustainable long-term value creation. Chief financial officer Britt Vitalone emphasized that the updated reporting structure reflects a strategic evolution of the business, accelerating growth in high-margin areas including oncology, multispecialty, and biopharma services.</p><p>The new North American Pharmaceutical segment combines McKesson's scaled wholesale drug distribution businesses in the United States and Canada. This segment delivers distribution services to retail and community pharmacies, along with institutional healthcare providers, maintaining the company's core pharmaceutical distribution capabilities while streamlining operations across North American markets.</p><p>A newly defined Oncology and Multispecialty segment represents a strategic focus on integrated solutions across oncology and multispecialty providers. This segment features specialty provider solutions with distribution-related capabilities such as specialty drug distribution and group purchasing organizations. It also offers practice management services supporting physician-led, community-based oncology networks, along with clinical trial services and specialty pharmacy solutions available through McKesson's digital platforms.</p><p>The Prescription Technology Solutions segment connects patients, pharmacies, providers, pharmacy benefit managers, health plans, and biopharma through scaled networks. This segment focuses on improving medication access and affordability while delivering measurable value to biopharma partners through technology-driven solutions that enhance the prescription fulfillment ecosystem.</p><p>Medical-Surgical Solutions continues to deliver medical-surgical supply distribution, logistics, and related services to healthcare providers across alternate sites of care. McKesson announced in May 2025 its intention to separate this segment into an independent company, signaling a strategic shift toward higher-margin healthcare services. The Other segment includes distribution and retail operations in Norway, which McKesson entered into a definitive agreement to sell on August 4, 2025, subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals.</p><p>Additional details regarding the restructuring will be shared during the company's Investor Day on September 23, 2025. The event will feature presentations by McKesson's leadership team and a live Q&A session with chief executive officer Brian Tyler and chief financial officer Britt Vitalone. The event will be webcast live on the company's investor relations website at https://www.mckesson.com/Investors.</p><p>The restructuring demonstrates McKesson's commitment to disciplined capital allocation and shareholder value creation while positioning the company for accelerated growth in high-value healthcare segments. This strategic realignment may influence how healthcare distribution companies structure their operations to maximize value in evolving market conditions.</p>
