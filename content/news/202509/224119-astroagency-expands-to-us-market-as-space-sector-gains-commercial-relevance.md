<p>Daniel Smith, founder of strategic communications firm AstroAgency and Scotland's first Trade & Investment Envoy for Space, is leading his company's expansion into the United States market as the commercial space sector gains unprecedented relevance. The firm, which describes itself as the world's first dedicated space marketing company, will open a North American office at <a href="https://vistasciences.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">VISTA</a>, Voyager Technologies' new science park initiative in Columbus, Ohio.</p><p>Smith's unusual path into the space sector began when he helped establish rocket company Skyrora in 2016/17 after recognizing a gap in the UK's sovereign launch capability. This experience revealed a critical challenge facing the industry: brilliant engineers and scientists often struggled to connect with audiences who could fund, support, or apply their work commercially. AstroAgency was created specifically to bridge this gap, helping space organizations communicate their value to governments, investors, and wider industries that can benefit from space technology.</p><p>The company has built a strong track record since its founding six years ago, delivering more than 100 projects for organizations including Spire, Hydrosat, <a href="https://catalystcampus.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">CATALYST</a>, Spaceflux, and institutions such as the UK Space Agency, NASA, and the European Space Agency. Smith emphasizes that what differentiates AstroAgency is its team's prior experience inside the space industry itself, approaching projects as insiders rather than external marketing consultants.</p><p>Recent milestones include developing the world's first national space sustainability strategy for Scotland in collaboration with Friends of the Earth, University of Edinburgh, Scottish Enterprise and the European Space Agency. This work positioned Scotland as a global leader in sustainable space, an area Smith considers crucial for the sector's future. The company has also engaged in significant educational outreach, helping share the story of the UK Space Agency's active debris removal mission with new audiences at events like Blue Dot Festival and New Scientist Live.</p><p>Smith sees the current moment as particularly significant for the space sector due to its growing commercial relevance. Space now underpins daily life through thousands of satellites providing communications, navigation, climate monitoring, and national security support. The commercial sector's rapid growth stems from space technology's application across virtually every industry, opening new opportunities for innovation and solving global challenges.</p><p>The expansion into the US market builds on existing partnerships with American firms including Voyager Technologies, OrbitFab, NovaSpace, Terrametric, AlphaData, and Astraius. Smith anticipates growing AstroAgency's team and presence in North America, with discussions underway about establishing an office within the VISTA Science Park at The Ohio State University, which would represent the nation's first science park dedicated to in-space research and innovation.</p><p>Looking ahead, Smith identifies the biggest untapped opportunities in how satellite data can solve real-world challenges outside the space sector. From radar measuring soil moisture to prevent landslides to infrared detecting crop disease before visible to the human eye, space technology has applications in virtually every sector. The main barrier, according to Smith, isn't technology but visibility - showcasing what satellite data can accomplish to drive uptake from governments and industries.</p>
