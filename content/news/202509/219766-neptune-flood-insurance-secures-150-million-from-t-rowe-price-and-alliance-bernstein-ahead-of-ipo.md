<p>Investment firms T. Rowe Price and Alliance Bernstein have each committed to purchasing $75 million of Neptune Insurance Holdings shares as the St. Petersburg-based flood insurer prepares for its initial public offering. The Baltimore-based investment giant, which manages $1.7 trillion in assets, serves as a cornerstone investor in the IPO alongside Alliance Bernstein, demonstrating significant institutional confidence in the flood insurance market.</p><p>Neptune Flood expects to price its shares between $18 and $20 per share, potentially valuing the company at $2.76 billion at the upper end of the range. The IPO involves only existing shareholders selling a total of 18.4 million shares, generating gross proceeds of up to $368 million. Selling shareholders include company co-founder Jim Albert and private equity firms Bregal Sagemount and FTV Capital.</p><p>Under CEO Trevor Burgess's leadership since 2019, Neptune has grown to become the largest private flood insurance provider in the United States, operating in all 50 states and the District of Columbia through partnerships with AM Best-rated insurance companies. Burgess will maintain voting power over 80% of the company following the public offering, ensuring continuity in the company's strategic direction.</p><p>The company's growth trajectory includes strategic acquisitions such as parametric insurance company Jumpstart in 2021 and Charles River Data in 2024, enhancing Neptune's in-house data science, artificial intelligence and machine learning capabilities. These technological investments have supported Neptune's expansion, with the company now insuring property valued in excess of $100 billion and serving more than 235,000 customers.</p><p>Neptune's financial performance shows strong momentum, with the company reporting $119.3 million in revenue and $34.6 million in net income for 2024. The insurer has secured $400 million in premium capacity for 2025, up from $300 million in 2024, supported by more than 30 global reinsurance and specialty market partners. This capacity expansion reflects growing market demand for private flood insurance solutions as climate-related risks intensify.</p><p>T. Rowe Price's participation in the Neptune IPO follows recent strategic moves by the investment firm, including a partnership with Goldman Sachs where Goldman will invest up to $1 billion in T. Rowe Price stock. The collaboration aims to leverage T. Rowe Price's investing expertise with Goldman's innovation in private and public markets. Earlier in September, T. Rowe Price also participated in a $1 billion Series E round for quantum computing company PsiQuantum.</p><p>Neptune has applied to list on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol "NP," marking a significant milestone for the seven-year-old company that raised only $12.6 million over three funding rounds prior to going public. The IPO represents one of the most substantial public market entries in the specialized insurance sector, highlighting investor appetite for companies addressing climate-related risk management through technological innovation. The substantial backing from major institutional investors signals confidence in Neptune's business model and the growing importance of private flood insurance markets in an era of increasing climate volatility.</p>
