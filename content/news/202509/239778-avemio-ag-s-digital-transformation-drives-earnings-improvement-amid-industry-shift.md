<p>Avemio AG achieved substantial progress in its strategic realignment during the first half of 2025, with the high-margin digital business making a decisive contribution to improved earnings. The German media technology company reported that revenue in its digital business rose to EUR 8.5 million, approximately double the prior-year period, while overall consolidated revenues reached EUR 41.9 million despite challenges in the traditional trading segment.</p><p>The company's proprietary developments are showing strong market traction, particularly in the United States. Two key platforms - the cloud solution helmut.cloud and the AI platform CaraOne - are approaching commercial breakthrough. CaraOne received significant industry recognition when it was named "Product of the Year" at the NAB Show in Las Vegas in April 2025, and has already secured initial orders from U.S. media companies. The order pipeline for CaraOne in the U.S. market has reached more than USD 5 million, indicating robust demand for AI solutions in the media industry.</p><p>While the digital business expanded rapidly, the trading segment continued to face headwinds from weak customer investment activity. However, the company's efficiency program is delivering tangible results, with fixed costs set to be reduced by approximately EUR 1.5 million annually starting in 2026. The full integration of all trading brands under the umbrella brand "Teltec" was successfully completed, streamlining operations amid declining industry-wide demand for high-priced capital goods.</p><p>Financial metrics demonstrate clear improvement in the company's performance. The Group's gross profit margin improved significantly to 23.9% with gross profit of EUR 10.0 million, up from 21.7% and EUR 9.7 million in the first half of 2024. Consolidated operating earnings showed substantial improvement at EUR -0.9 million compared to EUR -2.1 million in the prior-year period, primarily due to cost reductions in the trading business. The Group's equity ratio strengthened to 46% as of June 30, 2025, underscoring Avemio's solid financial foundation.</p><p>Ralf P. Pfeffer, Chief Executive Officer of Avemio AG, emphasized that the reorganization of the trading business provides the foundation for consistent investment in future technologies. "With our cloud and AI solutions, we are well positioned to benefit from the digital transformation of the media industry and to evolve from an independent German trading company into an internationally active media technology group," Pfeffer stated. He noted that the digital solutions from MoovIT Group and ObviousFuture GmbH are market-ready and the pilot phase is complete, positioning the company to capitalize on its investments.</p><p>For the second half of 2025, Avemio expects a moderate revival in the trading business and the first significant revenue contributions from new digital products. The company's 2025 Half-Year Report is available on the company's website at <a href="https://avemio.com/news/#finanzberichte" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://avemio.com/news/#finanzberichte</a>. The strategic shift toward digital solutions represents a fundamental transformation for Avemio as it navigates structural changes in the media technology industry and positions itself for sustained growth in both traditional and digital segments.</p>
