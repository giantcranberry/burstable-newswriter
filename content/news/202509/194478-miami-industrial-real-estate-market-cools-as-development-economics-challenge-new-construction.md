<p>The Miami industrial real estate market is undergoing a significant shift as demand cools from recent peak levels, according to Edward W. Easton, chairman of The Easton Group. While the market continues to perform reasonably well with deals still being completed, transaction volumes have declined due to a price disconnect between buyers and sellers who have not adjusted expectations to current market conditions.</p><p>Rental rates remain generally stable, but Easton anticipates a modest correction of approximately 8% over the next year. Occupancy rates have also seen a slight decline from about 98% to roughly 95%, indicating a more balanced market environment. The current climate features more cautious capital and extended decision-making timelines for transactions.</p><p>New construction activity has experienced a significant slowdown across the market. Development economics have become challenging with current costs reaching approximately $350 per square foot including land acquisition, while market rents average only $15 per square foot. This results in projected returns of about 4.28%, which Easton notes is insufficient to justify new construction projects at present.</p><p>Most developers, including The Easton Group, are adopting a wait-and-see approach. While projects already in the pipeline will continue moving forward, new developments are likely to be paused until either construction costs decrease or rental rates increase sufficiently to improve financial viability. The market already contains adequate available space, further reducing the urgency for new construction.</p><p>The Easton Group is focusing its investment strategy on acquiring existing buildings rather than pursuing new development. The firm targets stabilized or near-stabilized properties, particularly those with in-place leases featuring below-market rental rates. This approach allows the company to capitalize on potential rent growth while avoiding the current challenges of new construction economics.</p><p>Despite some stress in commercial mortgage-backed securities, Easton does not anticipate widespread distress in the market. Banks overall are not facing significant loan-loss issues, and both debt and equity capital markets remain relatively healthy. While isolated pockets of distress may emerge in certain asset classes, the overall liquidity in the market suggests limited systemic problems ahead for Miami's industrial real estate sector.</p>
