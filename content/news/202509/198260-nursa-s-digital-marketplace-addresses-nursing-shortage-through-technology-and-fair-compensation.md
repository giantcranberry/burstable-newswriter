<p>Curtis Anderson, CEO and founder of Nursa, has developed a digital platform that directly connects healthcare facilities with qualified nurses to combat the ongoing nursing shortage crisis. The company operates as a digital marketplace rather than a traditional staffing agency, eliminating middlemen between facilities and nurses. Nursa has experienced remarkable growth, expanding from 20,000 to 2.5 million patient hours annually in less than 36 months.</p><p>The platform enables healthcare managers facing staffing shortages to access a network of over 400,000 credentialed nurses nationwide. Nursa's sophisticated matching algorithms consider specialization, experience, location, and specific facility requirements to efficiently fill shifts. The company maintains its mission to put a nurse at the bedside of every patient in need, unchanged since its founding in 2019.</p><p>Anderson identifies the nursing shortage as a recurring cycle in American healthcare, exacerbated by systemic issues including inadequate compensation and burnout. Nurses are leaving not because they don't want to care for patients, but because the system signals that their work isn't recognized or compensated appropriately. Nursa addresses this by giving nurses control over their schedules and providing fair compensation opportunities.</p><p>The platform's effectiveness is demonstrated through partnerships with more than 3,400 facilities. EmpRes Healthcare implemented Nursa across 23 buildings, reducing their dependence on external agencies from 11 to just 3 and saving $300,000 in hire-away fees. The company also eliminated overtime costs and reduced recruitment expenses by streamlining the hiring process. Forest Grove achieved 100% fill rates for posted shifts, often within minutes of posting.</p><p>Nursa's technological approach includes robust credentialing verification, maintaining industry-leading standards as the only Gold Seal Joint Commission National Quality platform marketplace partner. The company continues expanding geographically, adding new markets and states monthly while refining platform capabilities.</p><p>Looking forward, Nursa plans to expand services across the comprehensive healthcare workforce ecosystem using an AI-first approach. The company aims to deliver personalized user experiences that traditional staffing agencies cannot replicate, focusing on flexibility, autonomy, and tools that improve patient care while supporting nurse wellbeing. With over $100 million in funding and a growing community, Nursa represents a technological solution to a century-old healthcare staffing challenge.</p>
