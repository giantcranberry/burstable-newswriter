<p>Motorola Solutions has been named the number one company by Fast Company for Best Workplaces for Innovators, receiving recognition for its leadership in developing purpose-built artificial intelligence that automates tasks and augments human attention to help detect, respond, verify and resolve safety and security threats. The company was specifically honored for its <a href="https://www.motorolasolutions.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Assist AI assistant</a> designed for high-stakes public safety environments where response time is critical.</p><p>With over 240 million 911 calls placed in the United States annually, each emergency triggers rapid flows of critical information into public safety command centers. Dispatchers must maintain composure during callers' most difficult moments while rapidly cross-checking details, locating first responders and providing essential support until assistance arrives. Motorola Solutions' Assist technology is purpose-built for these high-stress situations, enabling dispatchers to focus on critical tasks while providing field responders with verified, tailored information for faster, more cohesive teamwork that helps save lives.</p><p>Mahesh Saptharishi, executive vice president and chief technology officer at Motorola Solutions, emphasized that the company is architecting the future of safety rather than simply building software. This recognition underscores our commitment to fostering a culture where groundbreaking ideas and purpose-built AI can thrive, building on our long history of working with emergency responders to develop lifesaving technologies that fit seamlessly into their workflows, Saptharishi stated.</p><p>Over the past decade, Motorola Solutions has invested approximately $18 billion in organic research and development and strategic acquisitions, including significant investments to advance AI applications across its portfolio of public safety and enterprise security solutions. The company demonstrates commitment to responsible technology design, development and use through initiatives like its <a href="https://www.motorolasolutions.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">AI labels</a>, which provide clear, concise information about how artificial intelligence is implemented across its technologies, marking an industry first for public safety and enterprise security products.</p><p>Mindi Bartee, PSAP education manager at the Greater Harris County 911 Emergency Network, confirmed the transformative potential of AI in emergency response. When there's an emergency, it takes multiple departments working together cohesively to coordinate a quick and appropriate response, Bartee explained. Assist gives us the information we need to work with higher efficiency, accuracy and speed. Fast Company reviewed over a thousand applications for its annual prestigious recognition, honoring the top 100 companies creating groundbreaking products while building cultures where innovation can thrive.</p><p>The recognition highlights the growing importance of specialized AI applications in critical infrastructure sectors. For business and technology leaders, Motorola Solutions' approach demonstrates how targeted AI investments can yield significant operational improvements in high-stakes environments. The company's focus on responsible AI implementation through transparent labeling sets a benchmark for ethical technology deployment in sensitive applications.</p><p>This development signals a broader trend toward purpose-built AI solutions that address specific industry challenges rather than generic applications. The substantial $18 billion investment over the past decade underscores the long-term commitment required to develop truly transformative AI capabilities. For public safety agencies and enterprise security operations, technologies like Assist represent a paradigm shift in how emergency response coordination can be enhanced through intelligent automation.</p>
