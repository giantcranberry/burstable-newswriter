<p>Safe Pro Group Inc.

The agreements cover both disaster response imagery for assessing storm damage to power grid infrastructure and routine condition assessments, positioning the company to play a critical role in maintaining reliable power delivery throughout the state.</p><p>The timing of these contracts is particularly significant given the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's forecast of a 60% chance of above-average Atlantic storm activity in 2025. Airborne Response's Florida-compliant drone fleet is now strategically positioned to support utilities in preparing for and responding to potential weather-related emergencies. The company's expertise in infrastructure inspection, monitoring, and emergency response services becomes increasingly valuable as climate patterns shift and extreme weather events become more frequent.</p><p>As a subsidiary of Safe Pro Group, Airborne Response benefits from the parent company's AI-enabled security and defense solutions.

The integration of Safe Pro AI software, Safe-Pro USA protective gear, and Airborne Response drone-based services creates a synergistic approach to delivering safety and operational efficiency across various applications.

The contracts demonstrate how AI-powered drone technology is becoming essential for modern utility operations, offering faster damage assessment, reduced worker risk, and improved restoration times during emergencies. For business leaders in the technology and infrastructure sectors, this signals growing market opportunities for drone-based inspection and monitoring services as climate resilience becomes a priority for critical infrastructure operators.</p>
