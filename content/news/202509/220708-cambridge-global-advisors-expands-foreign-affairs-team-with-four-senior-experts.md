<p>Cambridge Global Advisors has announced the addition of four distinguished Senior Advisors to its foreign affairs team, significantly enhancing the firm's capacity to address complex international challenges. The expansion comes as global affairs grow increasingly complex, requiring organizations to rely on trusted advisors with international expertise, policy insight, and operational experience to navigate shifting landscapes.</p><p>The new advisors bring nearly 200 years of combined experience across diplomacy, security, development, and regional strategy. Gentry Smith joins as a former Assistant Secretary for Diplomatic Security at the U.S. Department of State and former Director of the Office of Foreign Missions, bringing extensive leadership experience in safeguarding U.S. diplomatic operations worldwide from key postings in Egypt, Myanmar, and Japan.</p><p>Sepideh Keyvanshad adds substantial international development expertise from her previous roles as USAID Acting Chief Human Capital Officer, USAID Mission Director in Nepal, and Deputy Mission Director in Afghanistan. Her background in stabilization and governance in complex environments complements CGA's existing capabilities. Scott Worden brings deep expertise in conflict resolution, governance, and the rule of law from his former position as Director of the Afghanistan and Central Asia Program at USIP, along with prior senior roles at SIGAR and USAID.</p><p>Brian Harding contributes specialized knowledge in Asian regional dynamics and engagement strategies from his experience as Country Director for Asia-Pacific Security Affairs at the Office of the Secretary of Defense and former Deputy Director of the Southeast Asia Program at CSIS. The addition of these four experts follows CGA's earlier expansion of Indo-Pacific expertise when Frank Aum, Tamanna Salikuddin, and Andrew Scobell joined as Senior Advisors.</p><p>Jake Braun, CGA CEO, emphasized that these leaders add tremendous depth to the foreign affairs bench, strengthening the firm's ability to support clients globally. Doug Lute, Chairman of CGA and former U.S. Ambassador to NATO, noted that with these additions, CGA now possesses one of the most comprehensive teams advising on foreign affairs challenges, particularly in the Indo-Pacific region. The growing bench reflects today's complex global environment and better equips clients to anticipate and respond effectively to international developments.</p><p>For business leaders operating in international markets, this expansion signals CGA's enhanced capability to provide strategic guidance on geopolitical risks, regulatory compliance, and market entry strategies. The firm's strengthened expertise in Asian dynamics, particularly through advisors like Brian Harding who brings experience from the Office of the Secretary of Defense, offers valuable insights for companies navigating U.S.-China relations and regional security concerns.</p><p>The inclusion of development experts like Sepideh Keyvanshad and conflict resolution specialists like Scott Worden provides clients with critical understanding of stabilization efforts and governance challenges in emerging markets. This expertise becomes increasingly relevant as businesses expand into complex environments where political risk and regulatory frameworks require sophisticated navigation strategies.</p><p>The timing of this expansion reflects the growing demand for specialized foreign affairs counsel amid escalating global tensions and shifting international alliances. For technology companies expanding globally, the diplomatic security expertise of advisors like Gentry Smith offers crucial understanding of protection requirements for international operations and personnel. The collective experience across government agencies including the State Department, USAID, and defense organizations provides clients with comprehensive perspective on interagency coordination and policy implementation.</p>
