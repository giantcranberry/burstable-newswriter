<p>Shala Hormone Health has launched NOURISH², a dual-action blend of prebiotic fiber and digestive enzymes designed to feed healthy gut bacteria, maximize nutrient absorption, and support whole-body wellness. The flavorless powder mixes seamlessly into any beverage, providing an effortless solution for daily gut and hormone care. This product addresses a significant health concern affecting women's wellbeing, with an estimated 97% of women not meeting daily fiber needs, which can impact energy, cravings, and overall hormone health.</p><p>The widespread fiber deficiency represents a critical gap in women's nutritional intake that directly affects hormonal balance and digestive function. NOURISH² works through a two-pronged approach: it feeds healthy gut bacteria with five digestion-friendly prebiotic fibers that promote balance, regularity, and comfort, while simultaneously maximizing nutrient absorption with five digestive enzymes that help break down carbohydrates, fats, and proteins for efficient bodily utilization. The combination aims to flatten the belly, sharpen focus, and support hormone confidence.</p><p>The supplement contains five specific prebiotic fibers: Guar Gum, Gum Acacia, Chicory Root Fiber, Fibersol-2, and Glucomannan, along with five digestive enzymes: Protease, Amylase, Cellulase, Lactase, and Lipase. Users simply mix one scoop (3.5g) with 10-12 ounces of their preferred beverage twice daily. The product is gluten-free, vegan, non-GMO, and each bag provides 48 servings at a retail price of $34.99.</p><p>Tori Poulter, CEO of Shala Hormone Health, describes the product as "your daily scoop of hormone confidence" that was created to help people feel lighter, more energized, and more in tune with their bodies through improved digestion and nutrient absorption. The product is now available through their <a href="https://shalahormonehealth.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">official website</a>, representing the company's commitment to empowering individuals with science-backed products that support hormonal balance, gut health, and whole-body vitality.</p><p>For business and technology leaders in the health and wellness sector, this launch highlights the growing market opportunity in addressing specific nutritional deficiencies through targeted supplementation. The product's formulation addresses a documented public health issue affecting nearly all women, potentially creating significant demand for science-backed solutions that bridge nutritional gaps. The direct-to-consumer availability through digital channels demonstrates how technology enables specialized health companies to reach consumers effectively with targeted solutions.</p>
