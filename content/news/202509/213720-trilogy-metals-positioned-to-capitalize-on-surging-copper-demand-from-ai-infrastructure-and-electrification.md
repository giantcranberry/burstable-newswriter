<p>Trilogy Metals Inc. is strategically positioned to benefit from the growing copper demand driven by artificial intelligence infrastructure and global electrification trends. According to industry projections, AI data centers alone are expected to consume more than 4 million tonnes of copper by 2035, significantly intensifying global demand for the essential metal.</p><p>Through Ambler Metals LLC, its 50/50 joint venture with South32, Trilogy controls the Upper Kobuk Mineral Projects in Alaska's Ambler Mining District. The district hosts volcanogenic massive sulphide and carbonate replacement deposits containing copper, zinc, lead, gold, silver, and cobalt. The combination of AI-driven data centers, renewable energy expansion, and broader electrification initiatives is fundamentally reshaping copper's demand profile across global markets.</p><p>With a 50% stake in one of North America's most prospective copper districts, Trilogy Metals possesses significant advantages in addressing the anticipated copper supply shortfall. The company's high-grade deposits, established partnerships, and supportive policy environment provide a solid foundation to meet the challenges of a tightening copper market. As global copper deficits loom, projects like Arctic and Bornite could play a vital role in securing future supply chains.</p><p>The Upper Kobuk Mineral Projects span approximately 190,929 hectares within the Ambler Mining District, which is recognized as one of the richest and most-prospective known copper-dominant districts worldwide. Exploration efforts have concentrated on two primary deposits: the Arctic VMS deposit and the Bornite carbonate replacement deposit, both containing world-class polymetallic resources. Additional information about the company's developments is available at <a href="https://ibn.fm/TMQ" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://ibn.fm/TMQ</a>.</p><p>Ambler Metals maintains an agreement with NANA Regional Corporation, Inc., an Alaska Native Corporation that provides a framework for exploration and potential development of the Ambler Mining District in cooperation with local communities. This partnership supports Trilogy's vision to develop the district into a premier North American copper producer while respecting and protecting subsistence livelihoods in the region.</p>
