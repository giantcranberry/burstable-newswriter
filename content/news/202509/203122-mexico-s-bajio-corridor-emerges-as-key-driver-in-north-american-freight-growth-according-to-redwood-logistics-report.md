<p>Redwood Logistics and its Mexico division have released the Q3 2025 Cross-Border Index, identifying the Bajío–Mexico City–Querétaro corridor as an emerging economic powerhouse driving North American freight growth. The report introduces the "Twin Triangles" concept, illustrating how manufacturers in Mexico's Bajío region are expanding operations to meet consumer demand concentrated from Querétaro to the Valley of Mexico, mirroring the economic dynamics of the U.S. Texas Triangle region.</p><p>Jordan Dewart, President of Redwood Mexico Operations, noted that hundreds of people are flocking to Querétaro daily, rapidly transforming the area into a major retail hub with surging consumption. This growth requires logistics providers to strategically integrate themselves deeply within Mexico, moving beyond mere border operations to effectively meet customer expectations amid the expansion.</p><p>Southbound demand is increasing significantly, driven by Mexico's expanding retail sector anchored by Walmart de México and ongoing nearshoring trends. These factors are drawing more U.S. goods into Mexico, with carriers operating south of the border actively seeking southbound shippers to achieve network balance. Mexico's economy grew by 0.7% in Q2 compared to 0.2% in Q1, with foreign direct investment and venture investment showing upward trends despite tariff concerns.</p><p>Effective August 11, 2025, Mexico has implemented Automatic Export Notice requirements through the SNICE platform, significantly impacting exporters of specific product categories including turbines, parts for electric motors, parts for transformers, parts for other electrical machinery, and fiber optic cables. Exporters must file an official notice requiring a free-form letter and a structured Excel form, with Mexican authorities targeting a 10-business-day approval turnaround.</p><p>Dewart emphasized that this new measure suggests a strategic move by Mexico to enhance control and monitoring over the export of industrial components and technologies, aimed at ensuring compliance with international trade agreements, managing domestic supply chains, and monitoring sensitive technology flows. To address potential disruptions and align with Querétaro's growth, Redwood Mexico recently opened a new office in the region, underscoring their commitment to providing localized support and expertise in navigating international trade complexities.</p>
