<p>The legendary Four Sixes Ranch has detailed its intensive sales preparation process that transforms young horses into confident, fit animals ready for their new owners. Sales prep season officially begins in mid-June and runs through September, with preparation starting even earlier as weanlings are halter-broke and handled before being turned out.</p><p>According to Dr. Nathan Canaday, Horse Division Manager, and Fallon Rand, Sales Prep Manager, approximately 50-60 horses are prepared annually, including yearlings, young riding horses, and seasoned cowboy horses with real ranch work experience. The program focuses on building a solid foundation so horses are set up for success regardless of their future careers.</p><p>The ranch's philosophy prioritizes fitness over fat, with Dr. Canaday emphasizing that fitness prepares horses for long-term soundness, preventing foot issues, developmental joint problems like OCDs, and metabolic issues in broodmares. Nutrition plays a critical role in the preparation process, with the ranch focusing on steady, balanced nutrition using high-quality forage and conservative grain rations.</p><p>Horses begin receiving the <a href="https://www.foursixesranch.com/products/multi-vitamin-mineral" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Four Sixes Multi-Vitamin & Mineral</a> as weanlings and remain on it through sales season. Joint health receives particular attention during sales preparation as horses transition from pasture to stalls and structured exercise routines.</p><p>The ranch immediately adds <a href="https://www.foursixesranch.com/products/joint-health-pellets" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Joint Health Pellets</a> for proactive joint care and <a href="https://www.foursixesranch.com/products/complete-gut-protection" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Complete Gut Protection</a> to counteract digestive stress during this transition period. Ranch officials emphasize that change is stressful for horses and encourage new owners to maintain gut health supplements and consider electrolyte supplementation.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.foursixesranch.com/products/electrolyte-powder" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Electrolyte Powder</a> helps ensure adequate hydration during the adjustment period, especially during hot weather or when horses are adjusting to new water sources. Every Four Sixes horse carries the historic 'L' brand, originally an anti-theft measure 150 years ago that now represents quality and excellence.</p><p>Through thoughtful breeding, balanced nutrition, careful training, and commitment to excellence, the ranch ensures each horse leaving their program embodies the legacy of the brand. This comprehensive approach demonstrates the ranch's dedication to producing horses that are not only physically prepared but also mentally and emotionally ready for their new careers.</p>
