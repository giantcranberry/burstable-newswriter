This trend has created new opportunities for investors seeking exposure to the growing sports investment market.</p><p>Brera Holdings PLC (NASDAQ: BREA), an Ireland-based international holding company, has positioned itself to capitalize on this market growth through its multi-club ownership strategy. The company operates across Europe, Africa, and Asia, focusing on portfolio growth, bottom-up value creation, and developing fan-to-investor pathways. This approach allows investors to gain direct access to the sports investment market through a diversified club portfolio.</p><p>The company recently demonstrated the effectiveness of its strategy through the majority acquisition of SS Juve Stabia, which now competes in Italy's Serie B. During the 2024-25 season, Juve Stabia's squad value increased by 245% to reach $32 million, showcasing the significant value creation potential of Brera's operational model.
