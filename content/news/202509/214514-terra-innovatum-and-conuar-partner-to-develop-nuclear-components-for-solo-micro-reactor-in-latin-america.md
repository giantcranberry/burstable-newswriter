<p>Terra Innovatum Srl has signed a memorandum of understanding with Argentine nuclear components and fuel supplier Conuar for the development and supply of critical cooling and fuel components for Terra Innovatum's SOLO micro-modular nuclear reactor. The partnership represents a strategic expansion into Latin America, identified as a key growth region for nuclear energy.</p><p>Under the agreement, Conuar will supply coolant tubs and plates, control rod mechanisms, fuel rods, and stainless steel and special alloy components. The companies will conduct pilot programs to evaluate scope and pricing for these components. Additionally, they will collaborate on developing a manufacturing and assembly hub in South America to increase production capabilities and better serve local customers.</p><p>Alessandro Petruzzi, CEO of Terra Innovatum, stated that Conuar's 40 years of expertise in fuel production and component manufacturing has been central to powering Latin America's nuclear sector. This partnership not only strengthens SOLO's global supply chain but also marks Terra Innovatum's strategic entry into the Latin American market.</p><p>Giordano Morichi, Partner and Chief Business Development Officer at Terra Innovatum, emphasized that the company is developing a global supply chain and deployment strategy for SOLO, ensuring resilience across multiple continents. The reactor's off-grid, behind-the-meter capabilities enable power delivery directly to communities and industries without requiring large-scale infrastructure investments.</p><p>Rodolfo Kramer, CEO of Conuar, described the agreement as a milestone in international cooperation for advanced nuclear technologies. He noted that bringing together Terra Innovatum's innovative vision with Conuar's proven capabilities represents a unique opportunity to accelerate safe, clean, and sustainable energy solutions.</p><p>The SOLO micro-modular reactor, conceptualized in 2018 and engineered over six years, is designed to provide 1 MWe of power using commercial off-the-shelf components. It supports both low-enriched uranium and high-assay low-enriched uranium fuels, offering versatility for future fuel supplies. The reactor is anticipated to be available globally within the next three years.</p><p>SOLO's applications include providing CO2-free, off-grid power for data centers, remote communities, and industrial operations in sectors such as cement production, oil and gas, steel manufacturing, and mining. The reactor can also supply heat for industrial processes, water treatment, desalination, and co-generation, while producing radioisotopes essential for oncology research and cancer treatment.</p><p>Conuar, a leading nuclear development and high-precision technology manufacturer, has produced 100% of the nuclear fuel used by Argentina. The company specializes in fuel supply and component manufacturing with strict adherence to international standards in demanding environments.</p>
