<p>Polymarket, the world's largest prediction market platform, and Stocktwits, the largest social platform for investors and traders, have announced a strategic partnership to integrate real-time probabilities on market-moving events directly into the Stocktwits experience. This collaboration represents Polymarket's largest-ever strategic partnership and brings together two dynamic platforms in trading and investing to deliver transparent, continuously priced expectations around events that move markets.</p><p>The partnership will debut with embedded earnings outcome markets on Stocktwits ticker pages and streams, covering select companies during earnings season. Stocktwits' 10 million-strong community will now be able to see Polymarket's real-time, crowd-priced probabilities alongside their conversations about earnings, sentiment, and market moves. Matthew Modabber, Chief Marketing Officer at Polymarket, stated that prediction markets transform uncertainty into clarity by turning big questions into simple, tradable outcomes with transparent pricing.</p><p>Earnings season has long been one of the most consequential and volatile times for investors, and this integration provides investors with a clean, continuously calibrated signal on expectations. Additional experiences include mention markets tracking whether specific terms appear on earnings calls, as well as discovery features such as curated collections and watchlists that highlight upcoming earnings with live probabilities. Probabilities will be displayed directly in Stocktwits discussions, with access to <a href="https://polymarket.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Polymarket</a> for deeper details, order books, and settlement rules.</p><p>Howard Lindzon, Founder and CEO of Stocktwits, emphasized that in a post real-time world, trust, community, and great signals matter more than speed. The integration allows investors to cut through noise and focus on the probabilities that matter most. Markets resolve on official company reports and call transcripts per clearly published rules on each Polymarket page. The rollout begins in September 2025 for select U.S. users, with broader availability throughout the earnings season.</p><p>Polymarket has recently expanded rapidly, setting records for new market creation and securing key partnerships and investments, underscoring growing mainstream interest in prediction markets. This partnership represents a significant advancement in how investors access and utilize crowd-sourced market intelligence, potentially reshaping how financial markets process information and make trading decisions based on collective wisdom rather than individual speculation.</p>
