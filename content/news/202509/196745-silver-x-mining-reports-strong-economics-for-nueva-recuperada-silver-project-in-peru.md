<p>Silver X Mining Corp. has released an enhanced preliminary economic assessment demonstrating strong financial performance for its Nueva Recuperada Silver District in Peru. The assessment shows an after-tax net present value of $439 million at a 5% discount rate and a 69% internal rate of return, based on a combined mining and processing capacity of 3,000 tonnes per day.</p><p>The project economics indicate life of mine cash costs of $11.8 per ounce of silver equivalent and all-in sustaining costs of $15.8 per ounce. With an initial capital expenditure of $82 million, including 13% contingency, the company plans to develop new processing facilities and dry-stacked tailings systems. The assessment forecasts average annual production of approximately 6.2 million ounces of silver equivalent over a 14-year mine life.</p><p>Chief Executive Officer José García stated that the results confirm Nueva Recuperada as a district-scale silver project that will continue to grow and operate for decades. The company's strategic plan involves operating two mines within the district: the Tangana Mining Unit, which has been in production since 2021, and the Plata Mining Unit in the southern part of the district known for higher-grade mineralization.</p><p>The company is pursuing an aggressive drilling campaign aimed at upgrading resource categories and expanding tonnage and grades across the district. García emphasized that the objective is to increase production by up to six times within the next few years through two milling facilities: a new 1,500 tpd mill at Tangana and an expansion of the existing Recuperada mill to 1,500 tpd capacity.</p><p>Environmental permitting is advancing, with a new Environmental and Social Impact Assessment for the Tangana Mining Unit in its final stages. The company expects approval from SENACE, the National Service for Environmental Certification, before the end of 2025. The mineral resource estimate has been updated with new block models, following CIM Definition Standards and NI 43-101 guidelines.</p><p>The preliminary economic assessment was prepared by independent consultants including Edgar Vilela, Donald Hickson, and David Heyl, all qualified persons under NI 43-101 standards. The technical report will be filed on <a href="https://www.sedar.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">SEDAR</a> and posted to the company's website within 45 days of the news release.
