<p>The commercial office real estate market is experiencing unprecedented skepticism as hybrid work trends and rising vacancy rates complicate financing across the sector. Despite these challenges, liquidity remains available for strategic assets that demonstrate strong fundamentals and credible sponsorship, creating a highly bifurcated market environment.</p><p>Regional banks have emerged as particularly active lenders, especially in markets they understand well, offering competitive terms driven by deposit relationships and sponsor confidence. Current financing terms reflect increased caution, with loan-to-value ratios decreasing to between 50% and 60% and debt yields reaching mid-teens levels. Strong deals may secure pricing potentially below 7%, though underwriting standards have intensified across all lender types.</p><p>Private debt funds are filling financing gaps where traditional banks have retreated, offering creative structures for transactions with lease-up risk or transitional business plans. These alternative lenders typically price risk at spreads of 400 basis points or higher, providing crucial capital for properties that don't meet conventional bank criteria.</p><p>Financial institutions now demand detailed answers about current and projected occupancy, leasing velocity, tenant creditworthiness, and cost basis relative to market comparables. Lenders increasingly underwrite vacancy assumptions even for strong tenants approaching lease rollover periods, and deals are sized based on in-place cash flow rather than projected rent growth. Appraisals face heightened scrutiny as the market requires more conservative underwriting approaches.</p><p>Capital continues flowing to specific office segments that demonstrate resilience, including partially stabilized buildings with realistic lease-up trajectories and properties with strong credit tenancy providing predictable income streams. Medical office facilities in growing suburban areas near healthcare systems and conversion projects such as office-to-medical or office-to-lab repositioning in top-tier markets are particularly attractive to lenders. Location and operational soundness now matter more than general office classification, with well-positioned assets maintaining access to competitive debt pricing.</p><p>Successful financing requires borrowers to approach lenders with realism and transparency, avoiding overpromised rent growth or underestimated tenant improvement costs and downtime. Conservative underwriting, experienced sponsorship, and deep understanding of local market dynamics prove essential for securing financing in the current environment. While the office sector faces persistent challenges, the capital markets remain open for strategically positioned assets with compelling investment stories that demonstrate clear paths to stabilization or exit.</p>
