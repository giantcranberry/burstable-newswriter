<p>Nauticus Robotics, Inc. (NASDAQ: KITT) will execute a 1-for-9 reverse stock split of its common shares, approved by its Board of Directors and stockholders at the annual meeting on June 25, 2025. The action consolidates every nine shares into one, proportionally increasing the share price while reducing outstanding shares, with effectiveness set for September 5, 2025. Trading will be suspended temporarily at 7:50 p.m. Eastern Time on September 4, 2025, resuming the next day under the existing symbol "KITT" with a new CUSIP number 63911H 306.</p><p>The primary goal is to raise Nauticus' per-share stock price to meet the minimum bid requirement of The Nasdaq Capital Market. A higher price could enhance appeal to institutional investors and other market participants who often mandate minimum price thresholds for investments. This move underscores the company's focus on maintaining its listing and improving market positioning, which is critical for accessing capital and sustaining investor confidence in the competitive technology sector.</p><p>Current shareholders will experience automatic adjustments, with every nine shares consolidated into one and fractional shares rounded up to the nearest whole share. Ownership percentages and overall market capitalization remain unchanged. Shareholders with electronic book-entry holdings need no action, while those with certificated shares will receive instructions from Continental Stock Transfer and Trust, the transfer agent. Details are available in Nauticus' definitive proxy statement (Form DEF 14A) filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on April 29, 2025, accessible at https://www.sec.gov/edgar/searchedgar/companysearch.</p><p>Nauticus develops autonomous robots for ocean industries, leveraging sensors, artificial intelligence, and advanced algorithms for perception and decision-making in marine environments. The technology aims to reduce operational costs, enhance data collection for subsea infrastructure maintenance, and minimize environmental impact. This reverse split may signal broader financial strategies to support innovation and growth in AI-driven maritime solutions, potentially influencing industry trends toward sustainable and efficient ocean operations.</p><p>For business and technology leaders, this development highlights the intersection of corporate finance and technological advancement, where maintaining stock exchange compliance can facilitate continued investment in cutting-edge AI applications. It may prompt similar actions among peers in the robotics and AI sectors, emphasizing the importance of market standards in driving innovation and economic resilience.</p>
