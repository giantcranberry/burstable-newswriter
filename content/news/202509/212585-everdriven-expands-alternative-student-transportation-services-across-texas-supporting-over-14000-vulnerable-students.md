<p>EverDriven, the national leader in alternative student transportation, has achieved significant growth in Texas, where its network now supports more than 14,446 students across the state. Over the past 13 years, the company has completed 860,286 trips and driven over 12.5 million miles in Texas, establishing itself as a critical partner for ensuring students arrive at school safe and ready to learn.</p><p>The company's expansion matters particularly because it serves some of Texas's most vulnerable student populations. This school year, 86% of students transported are experiencing housing instability under the McKinney-Vento Act, while 9% require special education support. With 102 school district partnerships across Texas, including major districts like Dallas ISD, Houston ISD, and Plano ISD, EverDriven provides flexible, student-centered rides that complement traditional yellow bus service.</p><p>Jazmin Harrison, Ph.D., Executive Director of Student Transportation Services at Dallas Independent School District, emphasized the importance of this partnership, stating that EverDriven's consistent and safe service helps meet diverse student needs, particularly for those experiencing housing instability or requiring specialized support. The growth has been rapid, with the company transporting 2,299 students, completing 100,749 trips, and driving nearly 2 million miles across Texas last school year alone.</p><p>Mitch Bowling, CEO of EverDriven, noted that Texas is leading the way in adopting modern approaches to student transportation, from large urban districts to smaller rural communities. The company's human-led, tech-enabled approach provides districts with its <a href="https://www.everdriven.com/360-degree-student-experience" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">360-Degree Student Experience</a>, offering full visibility of every ride to strengthen safety, transparency, and accountability.</p><p>EverDriven maintains a 99.99% safety record and 100% compliance in driver and vehicle safety checks, combining flexible routing, rigorous safety protocols, and real-time visibility to give districts confidence and families peace of mind. The company plans to expand service to additional districts, roll out new visibility-enhancing technology, and continue raising safety standards as Texas's student population grows more diverse and mobility needs become more complex.</p>
