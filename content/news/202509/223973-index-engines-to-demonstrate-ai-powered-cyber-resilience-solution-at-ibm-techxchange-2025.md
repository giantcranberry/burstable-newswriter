<p>Index Engines announced it will showcase its cyber resilience solution at IBM TechXchange 2025, scheduled for October 6-9 at the Orange County Convention Center and Hilton Orlando. The company will demonstrate how its CyberSense platform combines immutable snapshots via IBM FlashSystems' Safeguarded Copy with forensic validation and advanced AI to ensure data integrity and trusted ransomware recovery.</p><p>The presentation will focus on how organizations can detect corruption, achieve predictable recovery with reduced reinfection risk, and maintain business continuity through faster recovery point objectives and accelerated restoration times. Jim McGann, Vice President at Index Engines, emphasized that while immutable storage is critical, immutability alone cannot ensure recovery. Organizations must be able to recover rapidly and with confidence, which the partnership between Index Engines and IBM aims to deliver.</p><p>IBM TechXchange serves as a technical learning event for developers, data scientists, and cybersecurity experts, featuring hands-on labs, technical breakout sessions, product demonstrations, and certification opportunities. Index Engines will conduct multiple sessions during the conference, including "Index Engines & IBM: Advanced Cyber Resilience Through Validated Immutable Storage Recovery" on Tuesday, October 7, from 10:30 AM to 11:30 AM ET. This session will explore how CyberSense validates that snapshots are clean, detects corruption to IBM Storage Sentinel, and facilitates faster, dependable recovery.</p><p>Another technical session, "CyberSense â€“ IBM FlashSystem Integration Architecture and Recovery Automation," scheduled for Tuesday, October 7, from 4:00 PM to 4:20 PM Eastern, will provide a deep dive into the architectural integration between CyberSense and IBM FlashSystems for automated cyber recovery. This presentation targets storage architects and engineers seeking to understand the technical implementation details of the cyber resilience partnership. For more information about the company's solutions, visit <a href="https://www.indexengines.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.indexengines.com</a>.</p><p>On Wednesday, October 8, from 3:00 PM to 3:20 PM ET, Index Engines will present "CyberSense 99.99% SLA: Engineering Cyber Resilience Guarantees for Mission-Critical Healthcare Systems." This session will demonstrate how CyberSense achieves its industry-leading 99.99% service level agreement through forensic validation engines and continuous monitoring, using real-world healthcare examples involving EPIC systems to show how hospitals can maintain electronic health record availability and protect patient safety during ransomware attacks.</p><p>The implications of this technology demonstration are significant for business leaders concerned with cybersecurity resilience. As ransomware attacks continue to evolve in sophistication, the ability to not only protect data but also ensure rapid, verified recovery becomes critical for maintaining operational continuity. The integration of AI-driven forensic validation with immutable storage represents a shift from reactive security measures to proactive resilience strategies that can significantly reduce downtime and financial losses associated with cyber incidents.</p><p>For technology leaders, the partnership between Index Engines and IBM demonstrates how specialized cybersecurity solutions can integrate with enterprise infrastructure to create comprehensive protection ecosystems. The focus on healthcare applications highlights the life-or-death consequences of data availability in critical industries, setting a benchmark for other sectors requiring high-availability systems. The 99.99% service level agreement represents an industry standard that could redefine expectations for cyber resilience across multiple business verticals.</p>
