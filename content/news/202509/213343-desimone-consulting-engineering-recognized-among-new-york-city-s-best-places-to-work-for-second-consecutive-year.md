<p>Crain's New York Business has named DeSimone Consulting Engineering to its 2025 Best Places to Work in New York City list, marking the second consecutive year the firm has received this recognition. The prestigious business publication partnered with Workforce Research Group to conduct anonymous employee surveys evaluating companies across the city, celebrating those that have made superior efforts to support and value their employees.</p><p>DeSimone's New York team members highlighted the company's support of innovation and inclusion, with 94% of surveyed employees expressing pride in being part of a company whose reputation, projects, and values align with their own. An impressive 98% of teammates reported understanding how their efforts impact organizational success, making them more motivated to contribute to meaningful work, while 97% said they go above and beyond for the company—reflecting the value and support of strong leadership.</p><p>Stephen V. DeSimone, Chairman and CEO, stated, "It is a tremendous honor to see our people affirm the values we live by every day. When our people feel supported, respected, and inspired, the projects we deliver for our clients exceed their expectations in terms of technical innovation and efficient delivery." The firm's workplace culture emphasizes growth and resilience through regular town halls, in-house seminars, tuition reimbursement, hybrid work options, wellness initiatives, and team-building gatherings.</p><p>Founded in New York City in 1969, DeSimone has grown into a global engineering leader with 19 offices across four continents, providing comprehensive services including structural engineering, façade consulting, and vertical transportation. The company's New York-based engineers have played pivotal roles in transforming landmark properties such as the office-to-residential conversion of One Wall Street and the reimagining of the Terminal Warehouse into a modern mixed-use complex. As structural engineer for the revitalization of One Times Square, DeSimone designed a dramatic new cantilevered observation deck and curtain wall that will be in place for the 2025 New Year's Eve ball drop.</p><p>The Crain's honor adds to DeSimone's growing list of 2025 accolades, including Top Workplace recognition from USA Today, The Sunday Times of London, and multiple Florida publications. Over the past five years, the firm has expanded its global workforce from 250 to approximately 600 professionals, adding offices in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, and South America while acquiring specialized companies to enhance service options for clients.</p>
