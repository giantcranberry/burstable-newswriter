<p>Code Ninjas, the nation's largest kids coding franchise, has opened its newest location in Greensboro at 2961 Battleground Ave, offering children ages 5-14 comprehensive computer coding, robotics, and STEM education through interactive video game projects. The center provides a safe environment where children develop problem-solving abilities essential in today's technology-driven world, representing a significant investment in local STEM education as artificial intelligence continues transforming workforce requirements.</p><p>Local owner Miles Martin, who brings over 20 years of IT and cybersecurity experience, emphasizes the importance of preparing children for technological changes. "AI and other technologies are transforming the way we live and work, and it's so important to help kids in our community prepare for these changes," Martin stated. The Martins, who also own the High Point location and plan expansion to Winston-Salem, were inspired by their own three children to bring the coding education program to the region.</p><p>The curriculum employs a martial arts-inspired structure with nine belt levels from white to black, allowing students to progress at their own pace with support from trained instructors called Code Senseis. The program emphasizes small milestones and "Belt-Up" celebrations to maintain motivation, culminating in each child creating and publishing their own app. This hands-on approach teaches technical skills while building confidence, creativity, and teamwork abilities transferable to various future career paths.</p><p>Beyond regular programming, Code Ninjas Greensboro offers flexible weeknight drop-in sessions, weekend camps, and Parents Night Out events, making STEM education accessible to busy families. The center's approach aligns with growing educational trends emphasizing project-based learning and practical skill development. Additional program information is available at <a href="https://www.codeninjas.com/nc-greensboro" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.codeninjas.com/nc-greensboro</a>.</p><p>The establishment addresses the critical need for early technology education as digital literacy becomes fundamental to career success. By making coding education engaging through video game creation, Code Ninjas bridges the gap between entertainment and education, potentially inspiring the next generation of technology innovators and problem-solvers in the Triad region.</p>
