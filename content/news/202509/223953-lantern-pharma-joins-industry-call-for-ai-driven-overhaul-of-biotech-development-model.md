<p>Lantern Pharma, a Dallas-based clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company, has aligned with industry leaders calling for fundamental changes to what they describe as a broken biotech model. The company's stance was highlighted during the 2025 BioNTX iC3 Summit, where CEO Panna Sharma served as both moderator and panelist. Sharma emphasized that despite available technology, drug development remains largely manual, stating that the industry hasn't adopted technological solutions quickly enough to address systemic inefficiencies.</p><p>The summit featured biotech executives who collectively declared the traditional drug development model unsustainable. Sharma specifically pointed to Lantern Pharma's RADR AI platform as a solution that can streamline discovery processes, accelerate clinical timelines, and significantly reduce costs. The RADR platform leverages over 200 billion oncology-focused data points and utilizes more than 200 machine learning algorithms to address what the company describes as billion-dollar problems in oncology drug development. More details about the company's approach are available in their <a href="https://www.lanternpharma.com/newsroom" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">online newsroom</a>.</p><p>Lantern Pharma's approach represents a shift toward data-driven drug development that could create a more sustainable future for the biotech industry. The company currently maintains a pipeline of therapies spanning multiple cancer indications, including both solid tumors and blood cancers, along with an antibody-drug conjugate program. Their development programs include a Phase 2 clinical program and multiple Phase 1 clinical trials, with the combined annual market potential of their pipeline estimated at over $15 billion.</p><p>This positioning comes at a critical time when the pharmaceutical industry faces increasing pressure to reduce development costs and accelerate the delivery of new treatments to patients. The broader implications of this industry movement extend beyond Lantern Pharma's specific technology. As biotech companies grapple with rising research and development expenses, AI-driven platforms offer the potential to make drug discovery more efficient and targeted.</p><p>The summit discussion reflects growing consensus that technological innovation must play a central role in reshaping how new therapies are developed and brought to market, particularly in complex fields like oncology where treatment development traditionally involves extensive time and resource investments. The industry-wide shift toward AI-powered solutions could fundamentally change how pharmaceutical companies approach drug discovery, potentially reducing development timelines from years to months while improving success rates.</p><p>For business and technology leaders, this movement signals important changes in the healthcare investment landscape. The adoption of AI platforms like RADR could lead to more predictable R&D outcomes, better resource allocation, and ultimately more affordable treatments for patients. As the biotech industry continues to evolve, companies that successfully integrate artificial intelligence into their development processes may gain significant competitive advantages in bringing innovative therapies to market faster and more cost-effectively.</p>
