<p>PowerBank Corporation is advancing three community solar projects in Nova Scotia, with construction targeted for spring 2026 pending interconnection results and financing. The projects, located in Sydney, Brooklyn, and West Petpeswick, represent a significant step forward in the province's renewable energy transition. The combined output of the three solar developments will total approximately 14,369 megawatt hours of clean energy annually, enough to power the equivalent of 1,140 homes.</p><p>This substantial energy production will contribute directly to Nova Scotia's ambitious target of sourcing 80% of its electricity from renewable sources by 2030. The 12.4 MW DC solar power capacity represents a meaningful addition to the province's clean energy infrastructure. Environmental benefits from the projects are projected to be substantial, with an estimated reduction of roughly 10,058 tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions annually. This reduction is equivalent to removing 3,081 passenger vehicles from the road each year.</p><p>The lifetime savings for local communities are estimated at $6.95 million, providing significant economic benefits alongside the environmental advantages. The company's progress on these projects was confirmed through official channels, with further details available at <a href="https://www.powerbankcorp.com/announcements" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">the company's announcement</a>. PowerBank Corporation, which trades on multiple exchanges including NASDAQ under the symbol SUUN, specializes in distributed and community solar initiatives throughout Canada and the United States.</p><p>Community solar projects like these provide local residents with access to clean energy without requiring individual rooftop installations, making renewable energy more accessible to a broader segment of the population. The timing of the projected construction start in spring 2026 allows for thorough planning and regulatory approvals while aligning with Nova Scotia's broader energy transition timeline. The projects' advancement demonstrates continued private sector investment in Canada's renewable energy infrastructure as provinces work toward their climate goals.</p><p>The successful implementation of these Nova Scotia projects would mark an important milestone in PowerBank Corporation's development portfolio. For business and technology leaders, this development signals growing investment opportunities in renewable energy infrastructure and highlights the increasing viability of community solar models as scalable solutions for clean energy transition. The projects serve as a case study for how private sector initiatives can align with provincial climate objectives while delivering tangible economic benefits to local communities.</p>
