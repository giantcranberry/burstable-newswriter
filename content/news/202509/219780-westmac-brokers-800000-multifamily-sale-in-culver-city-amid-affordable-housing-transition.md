<p>Westmac Commercial Brokerage Company facilitated the sale of a multifamily property at 2656-2662 Â½ La Cienega Avenue in Culver City for $800,000. The transaction involved an approximately 5,682-square-foot apartment building situated on a 5,759-square-foot lot containing eight residential units. The buyer, BLRS Equities, acquired the property as part of an IRS 1031 tax-deferred exchange, a strategy that allows investors to defer capital gains taxes when selling and replacing investment properties.</p><p>The sale represents the conclusion of a long-term affordable housing investment that originated with support from the City of Los Angeles following the 1994 Northridge earthquake. T.C. Macker, CCIM of Westmac noted that the buyer acquired the asset at a low price point and low price per unit, though the property remains subject to rent control regulations and approaches the expiration of a 30-year City Regulatory Agreement. The regulatory agreement likely provided incentives or requirements related to affordable housing provisions that have governed the property's operation for three decades.</p><p>The transaction was handled by Westmac brokers T.C. Macker, CCIM, and Woody Cook, who represented the seller in the deal. Westmac Commercial Brokerage Company maintains its corporate presence at <a href="https://www.westmaccommercial.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.westmaccommercial.com</a>, where the firm outlines its commercial real estate services spanning office, industrial, retail, and multifamily properties throughout the Los Angeles market.</p><p>This sale highlights the ongoing activity in Los Angeles County's multifamily market, particularly for properties with historical affordable housing components. The transaction's timing coincides with the natural expiration cycle of long-term regulatory agreements established decades ago, potentially creating new investment opportunities while raising questions about the future affordability of such properties once regulatory constraints expire. For business and technology leaders monitoring real estate trends, this transaction signals a broader pattern of affordable housing stock transitioning to market-rate properties as regulatory agreements mature.</p><p>The use of a 1031 exchange in this transaction demonstrates sophisticated tax strategy implementation by institutional investors in the multifamily sector. As more properties approach the end of their regulatory agreement terms, investors are positioning themselves to acquire assets at favorable pricing before potential rent increases become possible. This trend has significant implications for housing affordability in Southern California markets where rental housing supply remains constrained.</p>
