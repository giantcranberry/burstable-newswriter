<p>Trailbreaker Resources Ltd. has mobilized an exploration team to its flagship Atsutla Gold project in northwestern British Columbia, focusing on newly acquired ground near the property's highest-grade gold discovery. The company's 100%-owned project covers over 40,000 hectares with limited historic exploration, located 70 kilometers south of the Yukon-British Columbia border.</p><p>The exploration program will concentrate on 528 hectares of recently consolidated ground west of the Highlands zone, where previous sampling revealed gold grades up to 630 grams per tonne. This area consists of 396 hectares acquired through recent staking and 132 hectares obtained through a purchase agreement signed August 26, 2025. According to the agreement details available on <a href="https://www.newmediawire.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">New Media Wire</a>, Trailbreaker will pay the vendor CAD $10,000 for full ownership while the vendor retains a 2.0% Net Smelter Return royalty.</p><p>CEO Daithi Mac Gearailt emphasized the significance of this exploration phase, noting that the newly consolidated ground represents virtually unexplored territory within the promising Highlands zone area. The company's team will conduct first-pass reconnaissance exploration including geological mapping, prospecting, and soil sampling while also preparing drill collar locations for future programs.</p><p>The Highlands zone has demonstrated widespread gold mineralization across a 750 by 600-meter area, with gold-bearing quartz veins confined to shallow-dipping fault structures extending 3.5 kilometers north to the Snook zone and 1.5 kilometers east to the Christmas Creek zone. This geological continuity suggests strong potential for additional mineralization within the newly acquired ground. The project is fully permitted for drilling, targeting two distinct deposit settings that have never been drilled.</p><p>The Atsutla Gold project's importance lies in its position along the regional-scale Teslin-Thibert fault system, where gold mineralization associates with Mesozoic batholithic intrusions. Since its discovery in 2020, Trailbreaker has identified five significant mineralization zones across 26 kilometers, including the Swan zone porphyry copper-gold-silver target located 26 kilometers southeast of the Highlands zone. Technical information about the project's geological features can be referenced through qualified person Carl Schulze's review under <a href="https://www.ni43-101.ca" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">National Instrument 43-101</a> standards.</p><p>This exploration program represents a critical step in advancing the Atsutla Gold project toward drill-ready status, similar to how the company progressed the Swan zone last year. The combination of high-grade surface samples, extensive mineralized structures, and previously unexplored ground positions this project as a significant opportunity for new gold discoveries in British Columbia's underexplored northwestern region.</p>
