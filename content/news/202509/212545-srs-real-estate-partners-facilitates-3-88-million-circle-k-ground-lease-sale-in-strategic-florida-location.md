<p>SRS Real Estate Partners has completed the $3.88 million ground lease sale of a Circle K property located at the northwest corner of SR-54 and Asturian Parkway in Odessa, Florida. The 5,200-square-foot property sits on 1.7 acres and features a new, 15-year, corporate-guaranteed lease. SRS Capital Markets Senior Managing Principal Patrick Nutt and Executive Vice President & Principal William Wamble represented the seller, a Florida-based private developer.</p><p>The buyer was a private investment entity controlled by family members residing in California and Florida. The purchase was executed to complete a <a href="https://www.irs.gov/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">1031 tax-deferred exchange</a>, a strategy that allows investors to defer capital gains taxes by reinvesting proceeds from the sale of one property into another similar property. The Circle K is part of a larger retail development that will include Fordâ€™s Garage, a three-tenant retail property, planned multi-family units, office space, and additional commercial offerings.</p><p>Patrick Nutt emphasized the appeal of ground-leased Circle K assets, stating they are seen as a gold standard for investors seeking cash-flowing assets with no landlord responsibilities and scheduled rental increases. Nutt noted that the SRS team has been highly active with the Circle K brand, having sold more than half of the new construction Circle K properties nationally since 2023. This transaction is part of SRS Capital Markets' broader activity, which has completed more than $1.5 billion in deal volume across more than 400 transactions nationwide this year.</p><p>SRS currently has over 845 properties actively on the market with a total market value exceeding $3.7 billion. The firm's expertise in retail real estate and its extensive transaction volume underscore its significant role in the commercial real estate market.
