<p>LaFleur Minerals Inc. has identified its Beacon Gold Mill as a strategic near-term revenue driver, with plans to restart operations by early 2026 following basic upgrades. The Canadian gold explorer and near-term producer holds full ownership of the mill at its Quebec Abitibi Belt Project, recognizing it as a critical resource for neighboring mining operations that have already expressed interest in custom milling agreements.</p><p>The company's strategic positioning in Canada's leading gold-producing Greenstone Belt provides multiple revenue streams beyond traditional exploration. While LaFleur continues to explore the potential of its approximately 18,304-hectare Swanson Gold Project, the Beacon Gold Mill represents an immediate opportunity to generate income through third-party processing contracts. This dual approach allows investors exposure to gold market opportunities without direct commodity investment during current record price trends.</p><p>LaFleur anticipates using the mill operation for its own production as mining activities commence at the Swanson Gold Project. The company's assets, including the mill and extensive land holdings, create a comprehensive gold development platform in one of North America's most prolific mining regions. Scientific and technical information has been reviewed and approved by Louis Martin, P.Geo., Exploration Manager and Technical Advisor, who qualifies as a Qualified Person under NI 43-101 standards.</p><p>The latest developments and corporate updates are available through the company's newsroom at <a href="https://ibn.fm/LFLRF" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://ibn.fm/LFLRF</a>. The Beacon Gold Mill's strategic location and existing infrastructure position LaFleur Minerals to capitalize on both the growing demand for milling services and the company's own gold production ambitions in Quebec's established mining jurisdiction.</p><p>The mill restart strategy represents a significant shift in how junior mining companies can mitigate exploration risk while building sustainable revenue. By offering custom milling services to neighboring operations, LaFleur creates immediate cash flow that can fund further exploration and development activities. This approach demonstrates how infrastructure assets can become valuable revenue centers independent of a company's primary mineral resources.</p><p>For the mining industry, LaFleur's model highlights the potential for shared infrastructure development in established mining districts. The Beacon Gold Mill's reactivation could reduce capital requirements for nearby mining projects while providing LaFleur with steady income. This symbiotic relationship between mining operations and processing facilities could set a precedent for more efficient resource development in mature mining regions worldwide.</p>
