<p>inDrive, the world's second most-downloaded ride-hailing app since 2022, has initiated its SuperApp strategy with the launch of grocery delivery services in Kazakhstan. This expansion represents a significant evolution for the company, which has already completed over 41 million deliveries globally in 2024 and more than 14 million in Q2 2025, making delivery one of the fastest-growing categories in its portfolio.</p><p>The company's strategic focus on frontier markets leverages mobile-first populations and rapidly changing consumer behaviors that create strong demand for affordable and fair services. inDrive operates with a capital-efficient, low-CAC, high-retention model that has already achieved EBITDA profitability while maintaining double-digit growth in the first half of this year. The company has completed more than 6.5 billion transactions and surpassed 360 million app downloads worldwide.</p><p>At the core of the SuperApp launch is inDrive.Groceries, a new service allowing users to order from more than 5,000 products with delivery in as little as 15 minutes. Early pilots have demonstrated remarkable traction, with an NPS of 83% and an average of five grocery orders per user per month. This indicates that grocery as a high-frequency service can anchor daily engagement and strengthen platform loyalty, potentially transforming user retention metrics across the platform.</p><p>The SuperApp is modular by design, built to adapt to each market's specific needs rather than following a one-size-fits-all approach. While grocery leads the rollout in Kazakhstan, other verticals drive adoption elsewhere. inDrive recently expanded inDrive.Money to Brazil, providing drivers and couriers access to digital loans of up to R$2,400, with similar services already successful in Mexico, Colombia, and Peru.</p><p>Evidence from early SuperApp rollouts demonstrates the model's substantial potential. In a sample of 16 focus cities, users of multiple services generate two to four times higher GMV and show over 15 percentage points higher retention compared to single-vertical users. Over the next 12 months, inDrive will roll out its SuperApp across key frontier economies including Kazakhstan, Mexico, Colombia, Peru, Pakistan, Egypt, Brazil, and Morocco.</p><p>Unlike legacy super apps that grew before the AI era, inDrive is embedding AI capabilities from the ground up while maintaining its founding principles of fairness and user choice. The company's approach ensures that peer-to-peer negotiation remains at the core of its pricing model, with AI serving to inform rather than decide pricing outcomes. This differentiation positions inDrive uniquely in the competitive landscape, combining technological sophistication with user-centric values that resonate particularly well in emerging markets.</p>
