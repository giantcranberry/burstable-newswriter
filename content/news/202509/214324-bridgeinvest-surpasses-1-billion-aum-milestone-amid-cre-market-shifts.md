<p>BridgeInvest has exceeded $1 billion in assets under management, a milestone that Managing Partner Alex Horn attributes to investor confidence and the firm's emergence as a market leader in senior-secured commercial real estate credit. The accomplishment is supported by a 90% limited partner reinvestment rate across five fund vintages, built on a 15-year history of delivering consistent risk-adjusted returns.</p><p>Over the past year, the firm doubled its origination volume and expanded into Central U.S. and West Coast markets, capitalizing on portfolio diversification opportunities and gaps created by retreating traditional lenders. BridgeInvest reviewed $46 billion in deal flow and selectively invested $685 million across 18 transactions, with a primary focus on transitional bridge lending. Strategic hires including General Counsel Isaac Marcus and Vice President of West Coast Originations Danny Alvarez facilitated this geographic expansion.</p><p>Horn positions BridgeInvest to benefit from macroeconomic uncertainty, noting that turbulent economic conditions can create favorable conditions for senior-secured CRE credit. Factors including tariffs, rising construction costs, and a historic wave of loan maturities are driving borrowers toward private lenders offering customized credit solutions. The firm is sourcing loans at SOFR + 300-650 basis points, resulting in 7-9% all-in coupons with first-lien priority and exposure below replacement cost.</p><p>A recent $21.5 million senior-secured loan on a 128-unit mixed-use project in downtown Atlanta exemplifies BridgeInvest's approach. The transaction refinanced existing debt and funded reserves while the borrower contributed $2 million in fresh equity, demonstrating the firm's capacity to provide flexible capital when traditional lenders withdraw from the market.</p><p>Multifamily properties remain a core focus, with $250 million closed across six transactions in the first half of 2025. The United States faces a 4.5-million-unit housing shortage, yet supply constraints have reduced construction starts by nearly 70% from their 2022 peak, creating attractive lending opportunities below replacement cost with conservative leverage structures.</p><p>Industrial real estate presents additional opportunities despite short-term oversupply concerns. Vacancy rates have nearly doubled from 3.6% in 2022 to over 7% in 2025, but BridgeInvest identifies potential in lending at conservative leverage levels while longer-term trends including onshoring and supply chain realignment absorb excess inventory.</p><p>Looking forward, Horn anticipates private credit will assume an increasingly central role in CRE lending, evolving from alternative to primary capital source. BridgeInvest's westward expansion positions the firm to develop new sponsor relationships and deploy capital selectively in markets where volatility creates attractive entry points, emphasizing reliability during periods of economic uncertainty.</p>
