<p>PowerBank Corporation (NASDAQ: SUUN) has secured all required municipal approvals for two community solar projects on industrial brownfield sites in Skaneateles, New York. The company obtained variances, site plan approval, and a special use permit, clearing the way for the projects to seek final approval from the New York Department of Environmental Conservation before construction begins.</p><p>The Skaneateles projects represent a significant step in expanding renewable energy access in Onondaga County. Once operational, the solar installations will deliver clean energy to the local grid, enabling renters and homeowners to subscribe to the community solar program and receive bill credits without needing to install solar panels on their own properties. This approach addresses a critical barrier to renewable energy adoption for those who cannot install rooftop solar due to rental status, unsuitable roof conditions, or financial constraints.</p><p>These developments support New York's ambitious Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act, which targets 6 gigawatts of solar capacity by 2025. The projects leverage PowerBank's extensive experience, with the company having developed more than 100 megawatts of completed projects and maintaining a 1 gigawatt development pipeline. The use of industrial brownfield sites for solar development represents an innovative approach to land utilization, transforming underutilized properties into productive clean energy assets.</p><p>Community solar projects like these are increasingly important as states work to meet aggressive renewable energy targets while ensuring equitable access to clean energy benefits. The projects demonstrate how <a href="https://www.energy.gov/oe/activities/technology-development/grid-modernization-and-smart-grid" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">distributed energy infrastructure</a> can be developed efficiently while providing tangible benefits to local communities. As noted in the company's <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001234567/000123456721000123/form10-k.htm" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">forward-looking statements</a>, such developments involve various factors beyond management's control, but the municipal approval milestone represents significant progress toward bringing additional renewable energy capacity online in New York State.</p>
