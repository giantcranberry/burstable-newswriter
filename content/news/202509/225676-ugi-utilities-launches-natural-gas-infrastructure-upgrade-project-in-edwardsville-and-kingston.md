<p>UGI Utilities, Inc. will begin a natural gas main replacement project in Edwardsville and Kingston Boroughs starting October 1. The infrastructure upgrades represent part of UGI's ongoing commitment to maintaining safe and reliable service systems while providing conversion opportunities for properties along the construction route.</p><p>The underground work will focus on Plymouth Street between Russell Street and Main Street, Main Street between Curry Court and South Page Street, and South Page Street itself. Construction activities are scheduled Monday through Friday from 7:00am to 5:00pm, with completion of the new natural gas main installation anticipated by mid-October, though weather and working conditions may affect the timeline.</p><p>Residents and business owners should prepare for significant disruptions during the project period. Road closures, detours, and parking restrictions will be implemented along the construction route. Natural gas service interruptions will occur, requiring UGI technicians to access properties for equipment inspection and relighting procedures. Final paving and restoration work will follow the main installation phase.</p><p>The project holds substantial importance for both infrastructure reliability and energy accessibility. By replacing aging gas mains, UGI enhances system safety and reduces potential service disruptions for existing customers. Simultaneously, the construction provides an opportunity for homes and businesses along the project route to convert to natural gas service, potentially offering cost savings and improved energy efficiency compared to alternative fuels.</p><p>UGI Utilities, Inc. serves more than 760,000 customers as a natural gas and electric utility provider.

The conversion opportunities presented by such projects can significantly impact local businesses' operational costs and sustainability profiles, making them relevant considerations for corporate energy strategy planning.</p>
