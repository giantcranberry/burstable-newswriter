<p>Daniel Jones, CEO of Hive MLS, has overseen the organization's transformation from a regional MLS with 6,000 subscribers to a multi-state network serving over 19,000 real estate professionals across North Carolina and Georgia. Between 2019 and 2025, Hive MLS tripled its subscriber base without relying on mergers or consolidation, instead building growth through trust and a cooperative network model centered on community, collaboration, and connectivity.</p><p>The cornerstone of this transformation is the MLS Data Exchange (MDX), a breakthrough model for interoperability at the database level that is reshaping how MLSs collaborate. Jones emphasizes that Hive's approach differs fundamentally from traditional MLS operations by ensuring associations remain fully empowered while the MLS accomplishes the vision of brokerages. The MDX platform represents a complete rethinking of MLS data sharing, creating interoperability at the database level rather than patching together feeds or building one-off integrations.</p><p>This approach allows multiple MLS instances to connect in real time without the friction and duplication that comes with traditional data shares. Jones explains that MDX creates data sovereignty and autonomy, where the platform becomes free to function as an interface overlay while the data remains truly the MLS. For agents and brokers who have long struggled with fragmented systems, MDX offers significant improvements. The model allows brokerages to have sovereign control over their data under the constraints of participation agreements with other brokerages.</p><p>Jones distinguishes MDX-enabled "intelligent consolidation" from traditional MLS mergers by emphasizing infrastructure consolidation rather than governance combination. MLSs maintain their boards, governance, and organizational structure while standardizing data, rules, and integrity operations. This approach maximizes brokerages' ability to cooperate with peers using timely, fair data without losing local control. The technology partnership with <a href="https://sourcere.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">SourceRE</a> provides the engineering depth needed to power this innovation while Hive contributes MLS expertise and collaborative business models.</p><p>The MDX model also represents an evolution beyond "Front-End of Choice" solutions, which Jones characterizes as merely overlaying another front-end interface dictated by a particular platform. Unlike FEoC solutions that continue to rely on fragmented databases, MDX creates true interoperability at the core level, making it what Jones believes is the only real path forward for the industry. This enables scenarios such as large brokerages wanting a single platform nationwide or small brokerages split between multiple MLSs seeking unified operations.</p><p>Jones challenges MLS leaders to consider whether they maintain sovereign control of their data and how easily brokerages can integrate their own platforms with MLS systems. He suggests the industry is moving toward brokerages building their own platforms and creating new participant relationships, urging MLSs to get ahead of this trend rather than maintaining outdated connections that limit innovation capacity. The MDX platform's database-level approach positions Hive MLS at the forefront of this industry transformation.</p>
