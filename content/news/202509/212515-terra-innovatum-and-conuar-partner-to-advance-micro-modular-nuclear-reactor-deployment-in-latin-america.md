<p>Terra Innovatum Srl has signed a memorandum of understanding with Conuar for the supply of critical components for its SOLO micro-modular nuclear reactor, marking a strategic entry into the Latin American market. This collaboration leverages Conuar's more than 40 years of expertise in fuel production and component manufacturing, which has been central to powering Latin America's nuclear sector.</p><p>The partnership strengthens SOLO's global supply chain and positions the company to scale production while accelerating the deployment of clean, affordable, reliable modular power. According to Alessandro Petruzzi, CEO of Terra Innovatum, this initiative also enables the provision of much-needed radioisotopes at scale.</p><p>Giordano Morichi, Partner and Chief Business Development Officer at Terra Innovatum, emphasized that the company is developing a truly global supply chain and deployment strategy for SOLO, ensuring resilience across multiple continents. This approach facilitates the delivery of affordable, zero-carbon, non-proliferant energy to emerging markets where infrastructure is limited or non-existent. SOLO's off-grid, behind-the-meter capabilities allow power to be delivered directly to communities and industries without requiring large-scale infrastructure investments.</p><p>Rodolfo Kramer, CEO of Conuar, described the agreement as a milestone in international cooperation for advanced nuclear technologies, noting that bringing together Terra Innovatum's innovative vision with Conuar's proven capabilities creates a unique opportunity to accelerate safe, clean, and sustainable energy solutions for future generations.</p><p>Under the memorandum, the companies will conduct pilot programs to evaluate scope and pricing for Conuar to supply coolant tubs and plates, control rod mechanisms, fuel rods, and stainless steel and special alloy components. They will also collaborate on opportunities to develop a manufacturing and assembly hub in South America to increase production capabilities and better serve local customers over time.

Built from readily available commercial off-the-shelf components, the reactor's proven licensing path enables rapid deployment and minimizes supply chain risks while ensuring final cost predictability.</p><p>The SOLO reactor offers versatile applications, providing CO2-free, behind-the-meter, and off-grid power solutions for data centers, mini-grids serving remote communities, and large-scale industrial operations in hard-to-abate sectors such as cement production, oil and gas, steel manufacturing, and mining. It can also supply heat for industrial applications, water treatment, desalination, and co-generation. Thanks to its modular design, SOLO can scale to deliver up to 1GW or more of CO2-free power with a minimal footprint, making it an ideal solution for rapidly replacing fossil fuel-based thermal plants.</p>
