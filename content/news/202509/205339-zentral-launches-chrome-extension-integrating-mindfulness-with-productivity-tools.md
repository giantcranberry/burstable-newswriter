<p>Zentral has launched a Chrome extension that combines focus timers, task management, and distraction blocking with mindfulness practices including guided breathwork, daily affirmations, and reflective journaling. This marks the first tool of its kind designed to transform the browser into a calm, intentional workspace for freelancers, entrepreneurs, students, and professionals managing multiple priorities.</p><p>According to Josh Gallup, Founder of Zentral, most productivity apps push users to do more faster, whereas Zentral helps people slow down, breathe, and set clear intentions before work. By integrating mindfulness into daily tasks, the platform aims to make productivity more sustainable and healthier. Key features include Mindful Focus Sessions with guided breathwork to reduce stress and sharpen focus, journaling and reflection prompts for self-awareness, a lightweight to-do and project management system, website blocking to limit digital distractions, ambient audio and screen tinting for a calming environment, and daily streaks with affirmations to build lasting habits.</p><p>With burnout and digital overload increasing across the workforce, Zentral offers an alternative to traditional productivity tools that focus solely on output. Research indicates mindfulness practices can improve focus by up to 16% and significantly lower stress levels, making Zentral's approach a timely innovation for those balancing competing demands. The extension is available on the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Chrome Web Store</a>, and more information can be found at <a href="https://zentral.life" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">zentral.life</a>.</p>
