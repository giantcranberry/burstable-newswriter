<p>Silver X Mining Corp. has completed two private placements raising aggregate gross proceeds of C$21.5 million, marking a significant financial milestone for the company's Peruvian silver operations. The financing consisted of a C$16 million brokered private placement and a C$5.5 million non-brokered offering, with both transactions involving the sale of units at C$0.50 per unit.</p><p>José García, President and CEO of Silver X, described the financing as an extremely important milestone that represents more than just capital – it is the catalyst for transformative growth. He emphasized that for the first time in the company's history, Silver X has the financial strength required to execute its vision properly and decisively. The strong investor demand led to two upsizings of the financing, reflecting market confidence in the company's strategic direction.</p><p>The capital injection will enable Silver X to significantly advance growth plans across exploration, resource conversion, and production scale at its Nueva Recuperada Silver District in Peru. According to company leadership, this positions Silver X to potentially become one of the fastest-growing silver producers in South America, with foundations in place to deliver sustainable value and operational excellence. The company aims to build what García described as the next district-scale silver project in Peru.</p><p>Each unit sold in the offerings consisted of one common share and one-half common share purchase warrant, with each whole warrant exercisable at C$0.70 until September 29, 2028. Red Cloud Securities Inc. acted as lead underwriter for the brokered offering, with Laurentian Bank Securities serving as co-manager. The underwriters also acted as finders for the non-brokered offering, receiving aggregate cash fees of C$1,258,020 and 2,516,040 non-transferable common share purchase warrants as compensation.</p><p>The net proceeds from the offerings will be used for capital and exploration expenditures related to the company's operations in Peru, as well as for working capital and general corporate purposes.
