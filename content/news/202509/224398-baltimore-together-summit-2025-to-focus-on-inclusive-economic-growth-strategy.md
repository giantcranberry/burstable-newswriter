<p>The Baltimore Development Corporation has opened registration for the 2025 Baltimore Together Summit, scheduled for October 27 at the M&T Bank Exchange. Now in its fourth year, the summit brings together city leaders, business owners, community partners, and residents to celebrate Baltimore's economic progress and plan the next phase of development work.</p><p>Launched as part of Baltimore's Comprehensive Economic Development Strategy, Baltimore Together focuses on building an inclusive economy by closing racial wealth gaps, investing in underserved communities, and supporting local businesses. The 2025 Progress Report and updated Implementation Matrix, to be released at the summit, will highlight key milestones from the past year. Mayor Brandon M. Scott emphasized the intentional approach to inclusion, stating that every decision must reflect the people of Baltimore and drive growth across all neighborhoods.</p><p>The opening day will feature a shorter program this year with three panel discussions centered on Baltimore's economic progress and implementation of the city's growth strategy. Panels will explore public-private partnership models for development, new investments, support for local businesses, and insights from companies that have recently chosen to locate in Baltimore. Speakers include Affan Sheikh of Hayat Brown, MacKenzie Garvin of the Mayor's Office of Employment Development, Eivind Dueland of Amber Infrastructure, Augie Chiasera of M&T Bank, and Mayor Brandon M. Scott.</p><p>Throughout the week, a series of workshops will take place in neighborhoods across the city, each highlighting key drivers of Baltimore's economy including community investment, building stronger commercial districts, the growing music sector, and strategies for building strong local economies. Attendees will hear from experts, participate in interactive discussions, and help shape the next steps in Baltimore's economic future. Registration is available at <a href="https://BaltimoreTogether.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">BaltimoreTogether.com</a>.</p><p>Otis Rolley, president and CEO of the BDC, described Baltimore Together as the organization's guiding strategy and framework for city growth. This means intentionally pursuing an equity agenda in every deal, investment, and program to ensure that growth mirrors the city's demographics and that pathways to prosperity are open to everyone. The summit is supported by sponsors including Bloomberg Philanthropies, CFG Bank, M&T Bank, BGE, WNADA, Johns Hopkins University, T. Rowe Price, Continental Realty Corp., CareFirst BlueCross BlueShield, and Annie E. Casey Foundation. Last year's event attracted over 1,100 attendees and more than 815 livestream participants.</p><p>For business and technology leaders, the Baltimore Together Summit represents a critical case study in urban economic development strategy. The intentional focus on equity-driven growth models provides valuable insights for corporate leaders navigating diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives within their own organizations. The summit's emphasis on public-private partnerships demonstrates how cities can leverage corporate resources while ensuring community benefits, offering a template for other municipalities seeking to balance economic development with social responsibility.</p><p>The inclusion of specific economic sectors like the growing music industry highlights how cities can identify and nurture unique competitive advantages. This approach to targeted economic development, combined with the comprehensive strategy framework, offers business leaders a model for strategic planning that balances immediate business needs with long-term community sustainability. The summit's neighborhood-based workshops further demonstrate the importance of localized engagement in economic development, a lesson that translates to corporate community relations strategies.</p>
