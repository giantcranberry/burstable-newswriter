<p>The International Franchise Professionals Group (IFPG) has maintained its dominant position in the franchise industry by earning the top spot on Entrepreneur magazine's prestigious Top Franchise Suppliers list for the seventh consecutive year. The recognition, featured in the September/October 2025 issue of Entrepreneur and on <a href="https://www.entrepreneur.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Entrepreneur.com</a>, underscores IFPG's consistent performance in a competitive field of franchise service providers.</p><p>IFPG CEO and Founder Don Daszkowski expressed enthusiasm about the repeated recognition, stating that while the honor has become familiar, it continues to validate the organization's commitment to improvement and team excellence. The ranking system, based on comprehensive surveys of more than 1,100 franchise brands, evaluates suppliers across critical metrics including quality, cost, and value, with franchisors directly rating their satisfaction with service providers.</p><p>Entrepreneur Editor-in-Chief Jason Feifer emphasized the significance of supplier networks in franchise success, noting that the list identifies partners who consistently deliver the expertise and support that differentiate thriving franchise systems from struggling ones. The Top Franchise Suppliers list categorizes service providers across 13 different segments, bringing attention to the vital role of suppliers and vendors in the franchise ecosystem.</p><p>In addition to the overall organizational recognition, IFPG's signature annual conference, the IFPG Retreat, was named a Top Franchise Event for the second consecutive year. The three-day gathering brings together hundreds of leading consultants, franchisors, and suppliers for workshops, networking, and presentations in an environment known for its energy and welcoming atmosphere. IFPG President Red Boswell attributed the event's success to the quality of franchise consultants within the organization, stating that having the best consultants naturally leads to winning outcomes.</p><p>The consecutive recognitions reflect IFPG's established position as a leader in franchise consulting and broker services. The membership-based organization connects franchisors, franchise consultants, vendors, and other professionals within the franchising industry, offering resources, networking opportunities, and support to help franchise professionals grow their businesses. IFPG's approach includes comprehensive training, certification programs, and a collaborative platform designed to match aspiring business owners with appropriate franchise opportunities while maintaining ethical standards and responsible practices.</p><p>The sustained top ranking demonstrates the franchise industry's confidence in IFPG's services and methodology. As franchising continues to evolve as a business model, the role of qualified brokers and consultants becomes increasingly critical for both franchisors seeking qualified candidates and individuals pursuing franchise ownership. IFPG's seventh consecutive recognition suggests consistent delivery of value to the franchise community and reinforces the organization's reputation for excellence in an increasingly competitive marketplace.</p>
