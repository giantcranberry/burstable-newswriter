<p>HF Foods Group Inc. has entered into a binding purchase agreement for a distribution facility in Chicago, Illinois, marking a significant step in the company's ongoing transformation strategy. The facility, which HF Foods previously leased following its acquisition of Great Wall Seafood in 2022, represents a strategic investment in the company's Midwest distribution footprint that will have substantial implications for the foodservice distribution industry.</p><p>The acquisition enables HF Foods to exit its lease agreement early while improving operating expenses and investing in additional capacity. This move is expected to drive consolidation opportunities and strengthen organic growth through cross-selling initiatives. The company believes owning the facility will provide greater operational control and enhance logistics capabilities for serving restaurant customers throughout the Chicago and Midwest region, potentially setting a new standard for operational efficiency in the competitive food distribution sector.</p><p>Felix Lin, President and Chief Executive Officer of HF Foods, stated that this acquisition represents a key milestone in positioning the company for future growth. Over the next several years, HF Foods expects to further expand its presence in the Midwest region, leveraging the Chicago facility as a cornerstone of its distribution network. This strategic expansion comes at a time when supply chain optimization has become increasingly critical for foodservice distributors facing rising operational costs and logistical challenges.</p><p>The timing of this acquisition aligns with HF Foods' establishment of an At-the-Market equity offering program, which the company expects will provide additional financial flexibility to pursue similar acquisitions in the future. The ATM program is designed to provide liquidity for working capital, capital expenditures, and potential business expansion opportunities, signaling HF Foods' aggressive growth strategy in the food distribution market.</p><p>This strategic development deepens HF Foods' commitment to the Chicago region and is expected to yield long-term benefits for local restaurant customers by reducing facility costs and driving margin growth. The company aims to supply the increasing demand for Asian American restaurant cuisine through its nationwide network of distribution centers and strong relations with growers and suppliers.

This move demonstrates how strategic real estate investments can drive operational improvements and market expansion in the food distribution industry, potentially influencing how competitors approach their own facility strategies and regional market penetration efforts.</p>
