<p>NeuralBase AI Ltd. (OTC: NBBI), operating under its enterprise brand BMP AI, announced that its Board of Directors approved a 5-for-1 forward split of its common stock on September 9, 2025. The stock split aims to increase the number of shares in circulation, making them more accessible to a broader range of investors and improving market liquidity.</p><p>Shareholders of record at the close of business on the anticipated record date of September 26, 2025 will receive four additional shares for each share of common stock they own. The new shares will be distributed on the payment date to be set by FINRA following their review of this corporate action. The company is expected to submit the required notification with FINRA pursuant to Rule 6490 and will file a Form 8-K with the Securities & Exchange Commission within four business days regarding this corporate action.</p><p>The 5-for-1 forward stock split is designed to provide several key benefits to shareholders and the broader investment community. The lower nominal share price following the split will make NeuralBase AI shares more accessible to retail investors and broaden the potential investor base. Increasing the number of shares outstanding is expected to enhance trading liquidity and reduce bid-ask spreads, benefiting all shareholders. The split positions the company's shares in a more optimal trading range, potentially attracting increased institutional and retail investor interest.</p><p>Shareholders will maintain their proportional ownership in the company, as the split does not change the underlying value of their investment. The increased share count provides greater flexibility for future corporate actions, including potential strategic partnerships and equity-based compensation programs.
