<p>The Architectural Glass and Metal Technician certification program, North America's only third-party personnel credential for glaziers, recently conducted hands-on testing at Frameless Hardware Company's South Gate, California campus, continuing a strategic partnership that includes prior testing in Texas and upcoming sponsorship at GlassBuild America in Orlando. This collaboration represents a significant advancement in professional standardization for the glazing industry, which has historically lacked uniform certification requirements.</p><p>AGMT certification provides an independent assessment of a glazier's fundamental knowledge, skills, and abilities through comprehensive written and hands-on evaluations, with certified professionals required to retest every four years to maintain their credentials. The program's growth reflects increasing industry recognition of the need for standardized qualifications, with 2,149 glaziers certified to date representing 41 states and four Canadian provinces, and a 12 percent growth rate in the first half of 2025 alone.</p><p>FHC's support extends beyond venue provision, with the company covering 50 percent of testing costs for candidates and serving as a vocal advocate for the program's mission. Andrew Haring, FHC Chief of Marketing, emphasized the program's importance, stating that as staunch advocates for education and training, they see how AGMT elevates the playing field, increases quality, and creates a standard.</p><p>The California testing event specifically targeted Southern California glaziers, with participants from Double Play Glass Co., Glazing Concepts Inc., Hale Glass, and Pacific Coast Glazing, resulting in nine individuals earning certification. Jason Simonette, AGMT Field Operations Manager who organized the event, noted the significance of industry support, highlighting FHC's financial contributions and vocal advocacy for certification value.</p><p>The program's ANSI-accredited status and third-party administration through Administrative Management Systems, Inc. ensure impartial assessment standards, while sponsorship by the Architectural Glass and Metal Certification Council, a 501(c)3 not-for-profit organization, maintains focus on public benefit rather than commercial interests.
