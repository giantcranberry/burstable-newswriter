<p>Jessica Lastarza, owner and lead attorney at We Mediate CT, along with her daughter Ainsley Lastarza, are serving as co-captains of Team We Mediate & Ainsley for the Interval House Walk to End Domestic Violence on October 4, 2025. The annual event, which draws hundreds of participants across Connecticut, raises awareness and funds for domestic violence prevention services while supporting survivors through emergency shelter, counseling, and legal advocacy programs. The team has set a fundraising goal of $5,000 to support Interval House's vital services, with over $1,000 already secured weeks before the event.</p><p>Lastarza emphasized that domestic violence often complicates divorce and separation proceedings, creating additional challenges for families seeking stability and healing. As a family law mediator specializing in out-of-court solutions, she noted that walking in memory of Jennifer Farber Dulos serves as a powerful reminder of how awareness and action can transform lives. The participation of a family law firm in domestic violence prevention efforts highlights the critical intersection between legal services and community safety initiatives.</p><p>We Mediate CT specializes in collaborative divorce mediation and family law services throughout Connecticut, focusing on non-adversarial approaches that help clients avoid the emotional and financial toll of litigation. The firm's alignment with Interval House's mission to end domestic violence through education and prevention underscores the importance of community partnerships in addressing family violence. Community members can support the effort by registering for the walk through the <a href="https://intervalhouse.org/walk" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Interval House Event Page</a> or making donations via the <a href="https://intervalhouse.org/donate" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Team We Mediate Donation Page</a>.</p><p>By emphasizing co-parenting plans that support long-term family well-being, We Mediate CT's approach complements Interval House's work in creating safer homes for children and parents. The walk represents not only a fundraising opportunity but also a public demonstration of commitment to ending domestic violence through collective action and professional collaboration. This partnership model demonstrates how legal professionals can extend their impact beyond individual cases to address systemic issues affecting family safety and stability.</p><p>The integration of domestic violence prevention into family law practice represents an important evolution in how legal services address complex family dynamics. For business and technology leaders, this approach illustrates how professional services can leverage community partnerships to address social challenges while maintaining core business functions. The collaborative model between legal professionals and domestic violence organizations offers a template for other industries seeking to integrate social responsibility into their operational frameworks.</p>
