<p>Rentana, an AI-powered revenue intelligence platform, is demonstrating transformative results for multifamily real estate operators facing seasonal leasing challenges. The platform recently showcased measurable outcomes from its partnership with Orion Real Estate Partners, a technology-forward investment firm that previously experienced a 3.5% rent decline using manual pricing processes.</p><p>Before implementing Rentana, Orion struggled with an inefficient, time-consuming approach to pricing that required extensive manual data analysis across multiple systems. The company sought to improve efficiency and portfolio performance without increasing staffing levels. After evaluating available solutions, Orion selected Rentana for its real-time, personalized insights delivered through an intuitive platform that emphasizes data privacy.</p><p>The results achieved within five months were substantial. Orion realized a 350% return on investment while dramatically reducing pricing review time from one hour to just ten minutes per property daily. This efficiency gain freed valuable resources for identifying additional operational opportunities. Most significantly, occupancy rates increased by 2%, providing enhanced pricing power during traditionally challenging market periods.</p><p>Mark Limpert, Principal at Orion Real Estate Partners, stated that Rentana has elevated their decision-making capabilities to unprecedented levels. The platform delivers intelligence and efficiency that enables the firm to anticipate market shifts and focus on driving results across their entire portfolio. Rentana combines public market data with proprietary portfolio insights to provide real-time, actionable recommendations through its AI-powered intelligence system.</p><p>Julie Blanc, CEO and Co-Founder of Rentana, emphasized that leasing slowdowns don't necessarily translate to lost revenue. The platform provides teams with personalized, immediate intelligence to operate more efficiently, scale smarter, and outperform competitors even in difficult market conditions. These results extend beyond Orion; earlier this year, Rentana helped 29th Street Capital achieve a $4.6 million valuation increase within 90 days, outperforming competing systems from established industry veterans.</p><p>Rentana is redefining revenue management for contemporary market realities, enabling owners and operators to scale efficiently, identify pricing and occupancy opportunities more rapidly, and maintain competitive advantages during market downturns and off-peak seasons. The platform's success demonstrates how AI technology can transform traditional real estate operations and create sustainable competitive advantages in volatile market conditions, offering significant implications for the broader real estate technology sector.</p>
