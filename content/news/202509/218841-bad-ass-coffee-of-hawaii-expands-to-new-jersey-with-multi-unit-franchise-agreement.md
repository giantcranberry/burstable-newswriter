<p>Bad Ass Coffee of Hawaii will open its newest franchise location in Madison, New Jersey on September 30, bringing premium Hawaiian coffees and island-inspired offerings to the community. The father-son duo of Jim and Tyler Bowman, both New Jersey natives, are leading the expansion with a multi-unit agreement that includes plans for at least six additional locations throughout the state. This strategic move represents a significant milestone in the brand's national expansion strategy and signals the growing consumer demand for premium, experience-driven coffee concepts.</p><p>The Madison caf√© at 14 Lincoln Place will feature handcrafted coffees, blended drinks, signature lattes, cold brews, teas, and food items with Hawaiian influences. Tyler Bowman emphasized that the venture represents more than just coffee service, describing it as an opportunity to create an energetic gathering space for local residents. The Bowmans bring complementary business backgrounds to the enterprise, with Jim's experience in technology entrepreneurship and franchising combined with Tyler's nearly two decades in entertainment and hospitality. This combination of expertise reflects a broader industry trend where successful franchise operations increasingly require diverse skill sets spanning technology, hospitality, and community engagement.</p><p>Bad Ass Coffee of Hawaii CEO Scott Snyder expressed confidence in the Bowmans' ability to successfully introduce the brand to New Jersey, noting their commitment to creating an authentic Hawaiian coffee experience. The company's name originates from Hawaiian coffee history, paying tribute to the donkeys that transported coffee beans down mountainous terrain on the Big Island. These animals were known locally as the Bad Ass Ones for their strong, stubborn nature in carrying valuable cargo. This historical connection underscores the brand's commitment to authenticity and quality, which has become increasingly important to consumers seeking genuine product stories and heritage brands.</p><p>The new location will operate daily from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. and will participate in the brand's loyalty program called 'Ohana Rewards, which offers members $5 off and 89 points after their first purchase. A grand opening celebration featuring giveaways, games, and charitable initiatives is planned for the weeks following the September 30 opening. The company sources its coffee beans from Hawaii's famous growing regions including Kona, Kauai, and Maui, maintaining what it describes as an uncompromising approach to quality and Hawaiian cultural authenticity. This focus on premium sourcing and cultural integrity positions the brand to compete effectively in the increasingly crowded specialty coffee market.</p><p>This expansion occurs as Bad Ass Coffee of Hawaii implements aggressive growth plans nationwide, with nearly 40 existing U.S. locations and 14 additional stores scheduled to open by the end of 2025. The brand's Madison location positions itself as a community hub within the town's transportation center, aiming to become a daily destination for residents seeking premium coffee experiences with distinctive Hawaiian character. The multi-unit franchise agreement with the Bowmans represents a strategic approach to market penetration that could serve as a model for other regional expansions, demonstrating how targeted franchise partnerships can accelerate brand growth while maintaining quality standards and local relevance.</p>
