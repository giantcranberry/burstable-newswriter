<p>The Baltimore Symphony Orchestra and its musicians have finalized a new three-year collective bargaining agreement that represents the most financially ambitious contract in over a decade. The agreement increases minimum musician pay by 12 percent over three years, reaching $101,350 by the 2027-28 season, while introducing groundbreaking audition and tenure review processes that could set new industry standards.</p><p>Mark Hanson, president and CEO of the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra, emphasized the mutual respect underlying the negotiations. This agreement reflects our deep appreciation for the artistry and dedication of our incredible musicians, Hanson stated. Just as we are honored to recognize their value with meaningful pay increases, we are deeply grateful to our musician colleagues for embracing important CBA changes that position us to expand audiences and strengthen revenue.</p><p>The agreement includes steady annual pay increases with a 3 percent raise in the first year (2025-26 season), 4 percent in the second year, and 5 percent in the third year. The contract maintains the full-time musician complement at 85 positions, including two librarians, while continuing competitive benefits such as 11 weeks of paid vacation, at least 30 days of sick leave, employer-paid pension contributions, and comprehensive medical and dental coverage.</p><p>Jeremy Buckler, chair of the Players' Committee, highlighted the broader implications of the agreement. This new contract empowers us to build on our legacy of world-class artistry, community, and economic impact, while enabling us to attract and retain the next generation of musicians, Buckler said. The musicians' commitment extends beyond Baltimore to audiences across Maryland, with the orchestra performing annually for more than 275,000 people throughout the state.</p><p>The most innovative aspect of the agreement involves completely redesigned audition and tenure review processes. All applicants will now be invited to live auditions without resume screening, eliminating trial weeks to ensure hiring decisions are based solely on blind auditions. The new system also discontinues internal auditions while allowing tenured and probationary musicians to automatically advance to the first final round of national auditions. These reforms guarantee every candidate equal opportunity and establish formalized evaluation criteria that improve feedback mechanisms.</p><p>Barry Rosen, Board Chair, credited the successful negotiations to the collaborative spirit between all parties. From the outset, these negotiations were guided by respect, transparency, and an unwavering commitment to our shared aspirations, Rosen noted. The agreement provides new operational and scheduling flexibility, giving the BSO greater ability to meet audience expectations and respond to new performance opportunities while growing revenues to sustain increased musician compensation.</p><p>The Baltimore Symphony Orchestra, which performs at both the Joseph Meyerhoff Symphony Hall in Baltimore and The Music Center at Strathmore in North Bethesda, has strengthened its position as one of America's leading orchestras through this agreement.

The ratified agreement takes effect from September 15, 2025, through September 10, 2028, ensuring stability and growth for the orchestra's artistic mission and community impact.</p>
