<p>Phong Ho, an Ave Maria resident and restaurateur, has significantly contributed to the local dining scene through strategic franchise acquisitions that address community demands. Having moved to Ave Maria in 2007, Ho transitioned from homebuilding to the restaurant industry following his father's encouragement, opening Tropical Smoothie Caf√© as his first venture to meet the need for quick-service options in the town center.</p><p>Thirteen years later, Ho identified another market gap and launched OASIS The Kitchen Lounge, a sit-down eatery that quickly gained popularity among residents and was recognized as one of the <a href="https://www.naplesnews.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">New and Best Restaurants in Southwest Florida</a> by the Naples Daily News. This expansion demonstrated Ho's ability to anticipate and fulfill evolving consumer needs within the growing community.</p><p>In May 2024, Ho expanded his portfolio further by opening the first west coast Florida location of Vicky Bakery, a family-owned Cuban pastry shop founded in Miami in 1972. The bakery's story began when Antonio and Gelasia Cao met while working at Cuba's renowned La Vencedora bakery before migrating to Miami as political exiles. Their traditional Cuban pastry recipes remain unchanged and have developed a strong following throughout Florida's more than 30 locations.</p><p>Ho's decision to bring Vicky Bakery to Ave Maria came after extensive research and community feedback. Residents consistently expressed enthusiasm for the brand, with one stating they would die for a Vicky at Ave. The addition addresses the breakfast segment gap while bringing authentic Cuban pastries to the community, enhancing the town's culinary diversity.</p><p>The expansion reflects Ho's commitment to Ave Maria's development since 2008. His businesses provide essential dining options ranging from dinner at OASIS to breakfast at Vicky Bakery and treats at Tropical Smoothie. Ho emphasizes that food remains at the heart of the Ave Maria experience, and having diverse options continues to be important for residents' quality of life.</p><p>Ho's restaurant group demonstrates how strategic business investments can enhance community infrastructure while meeting evolving consumer needs. His approach to identifying market gaps and responding to community demands serves as a model for other developing communities seeking to build comprehensive commercial landscapes. The successful integration of established brands like Vicky Bakery into new markets highlights the importance of understanding local demographics and preferences when expanding business operations.</p>
