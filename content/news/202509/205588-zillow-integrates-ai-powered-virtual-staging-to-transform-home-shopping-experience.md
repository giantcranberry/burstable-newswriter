<p>Zillow has launched Virtual Staging, an AI-powered feature integrated into its premium Zillow Showcase listing experience that allows home shoppers to digitally restyle rooms with various design aesthetics through a single tap. This technology tackles a core real estate challenge where buyers frequently struggle to visualize themselves in empty spaces or properties decorated differently from their preferences.</p><p>According to Amanda Pendleton, Zillow's home trends expert, "Buying a home is an emotional decision as much as a financial one. Too many buyers overlook what could be the perfect home for their family simply because they can't see past the furniture or design choices. Virtual Staging helps people envision themselves living in a space." The feature appears as an icon on select featured room photos within Showcase listings, enabling users to choose from curated design styles including modern, Scandinavian, industrial, midcentury, luxury, coastal, and farmhouse.</p><p>The technology represents the first major integration from Virtual Staging AI (VSAI), which Zillow acquired in October 2024. Josh Weisberg, senior vice president of AI at Zillow, stated, "Virtual Staging applies the AI field of computer vision to restyle listing photos in real time to help shoppers see a home's potential and give agents a time-saving way to stand out. It's the next chapter in Showcase's evolution and a step forward in making home shopping more immersive and personal."</p><p>For real estate professionals, the feature offers significant competitive advantages in a crowded market. Showcase listings already demonstrate measurable success, with agents using the premium service on most listings winning 30% more listings than non-Showcase agents, and these properties selling for $7,000 more on average according to company data. The interactive capability meets growing consumer demand, as Zillow's <a href="https://www.zillow.com/research/consumer-housing-trends-2024-35000/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">2024 Consumer Housing Trends Report</a> found that 71% of sellers are more likely to hire agents who use interactive media like virtual tours or floor plans.</p><p>The technology builds upon Zillow's Summer Launch that introduced SkyTour, an interactive aerial property view, creating what the company describes as a new standard for digital home shopping experiences. Virtual Staging can also remove existing furniture entirely, allowing buyers to see properties as blank slates ready for their imagination, while the refresh feature generates new furniture arrangements within the same style for additional inspiration.</p><p>This consumer-facing implementation follows the technology's earlier availability through <a href="https://www.aryeo.com/virtual-staging" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Aryeo</a>, where real estate photographers and media companies have accessed virtual staging capabilities at no extra cost to subscribers since March. The integration into Zillow Showcase now makes this technology directly accessible to home shoppers, creating a more personalized, immersive home shopping journey that moves artificial intelligence in real estate beyond theoretical applications into practical, visual results benefiting both buyers and industry professionals.</p>
