<p>The September Port/Rail Ramp Index from ITS Logistics indicates a complex supply chain environment where declining import volumes coincide with increasing inland freight pressures and rising cargo theft risks. Import volumes dipped slightly in August, confirming that the traditional surge of drayage activity spanning late Q3 to early Q4 will not materialize for the 2025 peak season.</p><p>Paul Brashier, Vice President of Global Supply Chain for ITS Logistics, explained that shippers have already moved inventory into North America during various frontloading surges throughout the year. This freight is now being transported inland from coastal areas, reflected in high inbound ocean and domestic container volumes and higher outbound truckload rates from areas with expansive distribution center footprints including Southern California, Dallas, Chicago, and Atlanta.</p><p>U.S. container imports for August totaled 2,519,722 twenty-foot equivalent units, up 1.6% year-over-year but down 3.9% from July's near-record highs. The National Retail Federation projects that tariff policies will result in a 5.6% decrease in total inbound volume for 2025. Given year-to-date volumes, this could mean a drop as stark as 17.5% is coming in the final few months of 2025.</p><p>These challenges occur within an exceptionally tumultuous regulatory period for supply chain professionals. August 29 marked the last day of the de minimis exemption, subjecting 92% of all U.S. cargo shipments to new duties and causing nearly a dozen countries and global shipping companies to temporarily pause shipments to the U.S. That same day, a U.S. appeals court ruled most tariffs issued by President Donald Trump to be illegal, with the Supreme Court's final decision expected in November.</p><p>Freight that has already entered the domestic market faces additional challenges. With large volumes of front-loaded inventory now moving inland, increases in ocean containers and intermodal equipment will likely cause congestion to key rail lanes for the next several months. For time-sensitive shipments, ITS Logistics advises onboarding additional drayage and cross-dock capacity to add flexibility and avoid delays.</p><p>Simultaneously, organized cargo theft and freight fraud have reached record-high levels across both rail and trucking. According to the Association of American Railroads, theft on railways surged 40% in 2024, costing Class I rail operators more than $100 million. Verisk CargoNet reported a 13% increase in truck-based fraud incidents in the second quarter of 2025, citing increases in organized crime and targeting of consumer goods.</p><p>Brashier emphasized that in peak season especially, stolen inventory and fraud incidents create delays that cost shippers far more than the lost load itself. He stressed the essential need to partner with carriers who provide real-time visibility and maintain rigorous onboarding and fraud-prevention standards to protect freight from port to final destination.
