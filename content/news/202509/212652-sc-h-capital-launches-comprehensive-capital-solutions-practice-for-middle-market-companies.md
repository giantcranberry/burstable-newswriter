<p>SC&H Capital has launched its Capital Solutions practice, creating a comprehensive suite of middle-market and mid-corporate investment banking services. The new practice positions the firm to structure and deliver capital at every stage of a company's lifecycle while addressing critical needs ranging from growth capital and acquisition financing to shareholder liquidity and complex restructuring situations.</p><p>The Capital Solutions practice significantly expands access to sophisticated financing solutions for founder-owned, sponsor-backed, and public companies navigating today's complex capital landscape. Led by Managing Director John Whalen and Principal Ryan Weir, the practice brings proven expertise in structuring creative solutions across the full capital spectrum, from secured bank debt to structured equity, consistently delivering capital alternatives that companies struggle to access independently.</p><p>This represents a major milestone that completes our vision of full-service middle-market investment banking, said Ken Mann, Managing Director at SC&H Capital. Companies today need advisors who can handle M&A, navigate distress, and structure creative capital solutions. Having all three capabilities creates exceptional value for our clients and referral partners.</p><p>The practice bridges critical gaps that many operating companies face in accessing institutional capital, and by sitting on the client side of the negotiating table, focuses exclusively on market advocacy for, and the best interests of, their clients. Capital Solutions runs disciplined processes by leveraging its extensive relationships with traditional banks, non-bank private credit lenders, insurance companies, family offices, and private equity funds to drive the most client-friendly, competitive terms available.</p><p>Whalen and Weir join existing SC&H Capital professionals, Rick Zytkowicz, who focuses on distressed financings, and Brady Richardson, who specializes in debt capital markets and offers deep expertise in healthcare finance. This senior team creates comprehensive capabilities for both healthy and distressed companies across multiple industries. More information about their services can be found at <a href="https://www.schcapital.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.schcapital.com</a>.</p><p>SC&H is building something powerful. We can truly advocate for our clients with no agenda other than achieving the right structure, terms, and price with capital providers that are aligned with the client's culture and vision, said Whalen. This is particularly valuable when accessing institutional capital for the first time, where senior-level guidance and high-touch service throughout the entire process makes all the difference.</p><p>The launch supports SC&H's national expansion strategy and growing presence in key markets, industry sectors, and situations while ensuring clients work directly with experienced professionals. The firm delivers services across numerous industries including healthcare, consumer, manufacturing, technology, government contracting, and business services.</p>
