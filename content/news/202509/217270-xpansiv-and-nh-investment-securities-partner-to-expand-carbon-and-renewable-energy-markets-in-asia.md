<p>Xpansiv, the leading infrastructure provider for global energy transition markets, has signed a Memorandum of Understanding with NH Investment & Securities Co., Ltd. to explore business collaboration aimed at expanding access to carbon and renewable energy certificate markets in Korea and internationally. The partnership represents a strategic move to scale environmental commodity trading infrastructure across Asian markets at a critical time when regional focus on carbon trading mechanisms is intensifying.</p><p>The agreement envisions NHIS becoming a participant on Xpansiv's CBL spot exchange and leveraging the Xpansiv Connect portfolio management system to support client trading activity in global environmental commodity markets. This collaboration will enable Korean companies to access sophisticated tools for managing their carbon and renewable energy certificate portfolios as part of comprehensive net-zero and emission-reduction programs. The partnership leverages Xpansiv's technology infrastructure, which includes the leading multi-registry, multi-asset environmental portfolio management system available at <a href="https://xpansiv.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://xpansiv.com/</a>.</p><p>KunHoo Park, Managing Director at NHIS, stated that the partnership will deliver innovative advisory services and advanced technology solutions that empower clients to access both carbon and renewable energy certificate markets. This collaboration supports NHIS's commitment to advancing sustainable finance and offering clients effective tools to achieve their environmental objectives. NHIS operates as a key market maker for the Korea Emission Trading Scheme and serves as a premier service provider for the Voluntary Carbon Market. More information about NH Investment & Securities can be found at <a href="http://www.nhqv.com/eng/index.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.nhqv.com/eng/index.html</a>.</p><p>John Melby, CEO of Xpansiv, described the partnership as another significant step forward to support Korea's environmental commodities markets through innovation and collaboration. The company believes NHIS's position as a trusted corporate advisor will facilitate market adoption by companies seeking to meet their sustainability goals. Xpansiv operates the largest spot exchange for environmental commodities, including carbon credits and renewable energy certificates, and provides registry infrastructure for energy, power, and environmental markets.</p><p>This collaboration comes as Asian markets increasingly focus on carbon trading mechanisms and renewable energy certification to meet climate commitments. The partnership between Xpansiv's global infrastructure and NHIS's local market expertise creates a powerful combination that could accelerate the adoption of environmental commodities trading across the region. NHIS brings its expertise as a pioneer in Korea's climate finance sector, offering a full suite of carbon finance services including emissions brokerage and advisory for carbon offset projects.</p><p>The strategic alliance has significant implications for corporate sustainability efforts throughout Asia, particularly for Korean companies facing increasing pressure to demonstrate environmental responsibility. By providing access to global environmental commodity markets through sophisticated trading infrastructure, the partnership enables businesses to more effectively manage their carbon footprints and renewable energy commitments. This development supports both corporate sustainability objectives and national climate goals, potentially setting a benchmark for similar collaborations across other Asian markets seeking to enhance their environmental trading capabilities.</p>
