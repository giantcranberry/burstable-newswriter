<p>StatLab Medical Products has globally launched the PiSmart S1 single-hopper slide printer, expanding its PiSmart labeling and tracking solutions portfolio. The new printer features a redesigned intuitive touch-screen interface and hardware enhancements for improved speed, flexibility, and reliability in laboratory workflows. This development addresses the growing need for efficient specimen tracking and barcode readability in pathology laboratories worldwide.</p><p>The compact PiSmart S1 supports on-demand printing while enhancing barcode readability and specimen tracking accuracy. Every printer comes with the PiSmart Promise, providing four years of service included when using StatLab validated slides. This integrated approach combines printers with precision-manufactured KTÂ® Premium Slides to create a complete solution built for accuracy and reliability, offering laboratories unprecedented operational consistency.</p><p>The product launch coincides with significant progress at StatLab's Arlington, Texas manufacturing facility, where U.S.-based slide production of KT slides is scheduled to begin before the end of 2025. This expansion follows a strategic in-region, for-region manufacturing model that will strengthen domestic slide supply for American laboratories. The facility complements StatLab's existing cassette and container production in Arlington, expanding availability of essential products across the pathology workflow and reducing dependency on international supply chains.</p><p>StatLab CEO Dae Hong stated that the company is delivering more than just an expanded printer portfolio, offering a complete solution that provides laboratories with peace of mind. The combination of the new PiSmart S1 with StatLab validated slides, soon to be manufactured in the United States, ensures consistent performance backed by an included service program not available elsewhere in the market. This approach represents a significant shift in how medical device companies support laboratory operations with comprehensive service agreements.</p><p>The PiSmart S1 is currently available for order through StatLab and authorized partners.
