<p>Work Wizard Software has launched what it describes as the first platform built by facilities professionals specifically for facilities professionals, aiming to transform how facility services teams manage janitorial operations with future expansion planned for engineering and landscaping services by 2026. The platform addresses long-standing inefficiencies in facilities operations by combining structured workflows, expert methodologies, and real-time analytics in a single dashboard.</p><p>According to John Combs, Business Development at Work Wizard Software, the platform was developed from firsthand industry experience rather than as a generic software tool. "We know the problems because we’ve lived them," Combs stated, emphasizing that Work Wizard connects data, teams, and performance to optimize operations and reduce costs.</p><p>Key features include data-driven bidding and workforce optimization, task scheduling and workflow automation, route intelligence for deployment efficiency, inspections and quality management tools, real-time performance analytics, and integration with IoT and robotics. Chris Wright, Chief Revenue Officer at Site IQ, noted that the platform provides rapid insights into technology investments, saying, "It gives us real-world data on robotics and sensors in seconds—so we know the impact before we invest."</p><p>The platform is designed for service providers of all sizes, from regional firms to national contractors, offering scalability for managing between 10 and 1,000 buildings. In an era of tightening margins, labor shortages, and rising client expectations, Work Wizard aims to replace outdated tools like spreadsheets with proactive, data-driven decision-making to help companies win contracts, deploy labor effectively, and improve service quality.</p><p>Work Wizard Software is already in use at facilities services firms across North America and is now available for broader implementation.
