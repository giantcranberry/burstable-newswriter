<p>Bad Ass Coffee of Hawaii opened its newest location on September 18 at 2850 Baseline Road in Boulder, offering handcrafted Hawaiian coffees, branded merchandise, and a food menu with Hawaiian influences. The shop, operated by local entrepreneur Beth Deasy and her team, features two patios including an upstairs outdoor fireplace and employs 24 local baristas, many from Colorado University.</p><p>Located steps from campus dorms, the cafe aims to serve as a study and meeting space while embodying the Hawaiian "aloha spirit." Deasy stated, "We're bringing the warm aloha spirit to Boulder! Craft coffee, friendly faces, and a welcoming spot between campus and the dorms where study sessions and hangouts for coffee lovers of all ages can share in our 'ohana." The location will host a grand opening celebration on September 20 with free giveaways, live Hawaiian music, hula performances, and burros from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m.</p><p>The expansion reflects Bad Ass Coffee's commitment to community integration, mirroring Boulder's strong local engagement. CEO Scott Snyder noted, "With our origins from Hawaii, we too share that same commitment to 'Ohana (family) and investment as an integral part of the community." The brand, founded in 1989 on Hawaii's Big Island, sources beans from the Kona, Kauai, and Maui regions, paying tribute to the "Bad Ass Ones"â€”donkeys that historically carried coffee beans down mountains.</p><p>Guests can join the Ohana Rewards loyalty program, receiving $5 off and 89 points after their first purchase. The Boulder shop operates daily from 6:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m., with mobile and delivery options forthcoming. Deasy plans to open another location in Lakewood's Belmar shopping center during the winter holiday season, part of the brand's aggressive nationwide expansion outlined at <a href="https://badasscoffee.com/franchising" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://badasscoffee.com/franchising</a>.</p><p>This expansion represents significant implications for the specialty coffee industry, demonstrating how regional brands can successfully scale while maintaining cultural authenticity and community focus. The strategic location near a university campus highlights the growing importance of capturing the student demographic, while the emphasis on Hawaiian heritage and local employment supports sustainable business practices. For business leaders, this model showcases effective franchise growth that balances brand consistency with local adaptation, potentially influencing other regional food and beverage companies considering national expansion.</p>
