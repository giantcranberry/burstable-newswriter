<p>UGI Utilities, Inc. will begin a natural gas main replacement project in Camp Hill starting October 1, representing a significant infrastructure investment in the area. The project underscores the company's commitment to maintaining safe and reliable service infrastructure while providing an opportunity for properties along the construction route to convert to natural gas service.</p><p>The underground work will focus on Scarsdale Drive between Rockaway Drive and Plainview Road, including intersections at Rockaway Drive, Cedarhurst Lane and Plainview Road where they meet Scarsdale Drive. Construction activities are scheduled Monday through Friday from 7:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., with completion of the new natural gas main installation expected by the end of October, though weather and working conditions may affect the timeline.</p><p>Residents and business owners should anticipate temporary disruptions including road closures, detours, and parking restrictions during construction hours. The project will require temporary interruptions to natural gas service, necessitating UGI technicians to access properties for equipment inspection and relighting procedures. Final paving and restoration work will follow the main installation phase.</p><p>The infrastructure upgrades align with UGI's broader service reliability initiatives detailed on their official website at <a href="https://www.ugi.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.ugi.com</a>. As a natural gas and electric utility serving more than 760,000 customers, UGI emphasizes the importance of proactive system maintenance to ensure long-term service stability and safety for communities throughout their service territory.</p><p>This project highlights the ongoing need for utility infrastructure modernization across Pennsylvania, particularly as aging systems require replacement to meet current safety standards and customer demand. The timing allows for minimal disruption during favorable weather conditions while addressing critical infrastructure needs before winter heating season demands increase. For business leaders and technology professionals, such infrastructure investments demonstrate the critical intersection of traditional utility operations with modern reliability requirements, highlighting how foundational energy infrastructure supports economic stability and growth in local communities.</p>
