<p>nuVizz, a transportation management solutions provider, will lead a critical session on B2B last-mile delivery strategies at the CSCMP EDGE 2025 Conference alongside industry partners Ford Motor Company, GEODIS, Cencora and Bart De Muynck LLC. The presentation titled "How to Build Resilience and Agility in B2B Last Mile" will occur on October 6, 2025, focusing on how manufacturers, distributors, retailers and third-party logistics providers can improve performance, visibility and adaptability in their delivery operations.</p><p>The session will feature insights from industry leaders including Doug Cantriel from Ford Motor Company's Customer Service Division, Bart De Muynck of Bart De Muynck LLC, Rebecca Jung from Cencora, and Jeff McDermott of GEODIS. These experts will discuss how technology and data are being leveraged to navigate the increasing complexity of B2B deliveries. Guru Rao, Founder and CEO of nuVizz, emphasized that "the last mile has become one of the most critical and challenging parts of the supply chain" as businesses face demands for faster, more efficient deliveries with greater visibility.</p><p>Through its collaboration with Ford Motor Company, nuVizz supports technology-driven improvements that help manage the delivery of over 400,000 parts daily to more than 3,000 dealers nationwide. Under Cantriel's leadership, Ford has modernized its transportation ecosystem by implementing a Transportation Management System, real-time visibility capabilities and last-mile optimization tools, resulting in improved delivery performance and reduced operational costs.</p><p>Cencora, a global pharmaceutical distributor, has partnered with nuVizz to enhance the efficiency and transparency of its B2B last-mile operations. Led by Jung, the company leverages advanced analytics and visibility solutions to manage high-volume deliveries while meeting the unique demands of highly regulated healthcare logistics. Similarly, GEODIS recently selected nuVizz's last-mile TMS platform to standardize business processes and create efficiencies across its last-mile business lines, with McDermott providing a third-party logistics perspective on B2B last-mile challenges.</p><p>Attendees can expect practical insights into how leading organizations are using technology, data, and collaboration to improve delivery performance and manage disruptions. Conference participants can visit nuVizz's booth #723 and find additional information at <a href="https://nuvizz.com/cscmps-edge-supply-chain-conference-exhibition-2025/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://nuvizz.com/cscmps-edge-supply-chain-conference-exhibition-2025/</a>.</p><p>The collaboration between these industry leaders represents a significant shift in how businesses approach last-mile logistics, particularly in the B2B sector where delivery complexity and regulatory requirements create unique challenges. The integration of real-time visibility systems and advanced analytics demonstrates how technology is transforming traditional supply chain operations into more responsive, data-driven ecosystems. For business leaders in manufacturing, distribution, and logistics, these developments highlight the growing importance of digital transformation in maintaining competitive advantage and operational resilience.</p><p>The pharmaceutical industry's participation through Cencora underscores the critical nature of last-mile delivery in highly regulated sectors where compliance and precision are paramount. Similarly, Ford's implementation of last-mile optimization tools shows how automotive and manufacturing sectors are adapting to meet evolving customer expectations for faster, more transparent delivery services. These case studies provide valuable benchmarks for other organizations seeking to modernize their supply chain operations and improve customer satisfaction through enhanced delivery performance.</p>
