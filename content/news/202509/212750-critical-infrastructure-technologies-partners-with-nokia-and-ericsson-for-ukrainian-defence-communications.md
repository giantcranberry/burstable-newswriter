<p>Critical Infrastructure Technologies Ltd. has executed two three-way confidentiality agreements with global telecommunications leaders <a href="https://www.nokia.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nokia</a> and <a href="https://www.ericsson.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Ericsson</a>, alongside Babcock Land Defence Limited, to advance secure communications capabilities for the Nexus 20 platform requested by the Ukrainian Ministry of Defence. These agreements establish a framework for collaboration on designing and integrating full-scope 4G/5G telecommunications systems into the Nexus 20, with both Nokia and Ericsson selected as preferred hardware suppliers for the program involving 50 platforms.</p><p>The partnerships leverage Nokia Solutions and Networks Oy and Ericsson Limited's proven telecommunications capabilities alongside Babcock's defence expertise to meet the Ukrainian Ministry of Defence's operational requirements for resilient, secure, and high-capacity communications in modern defence operations. Brenton Scott, CEO of CiTech, stated that these NDAs ensure industry leaders can work together in a secure environment to deliver world-class communications systems, advancing toward fully integrated next-generation communications for the Nexus 20 platform.</p><p>The execution of these agreements paves the way for detailed system design and integration, bringing the project closer to deployment while addressing critical needs for autonomous, high-capacity mobile communications in defence applications. This development highlights the growing importance of secure military communications infrastructure and international collaboration in defence technology, particularly in response to specific operational requirements from national defence ministries.</p><p>The Nexus 20 program represents a significant step in enhancing communications resilience for defence operations through industry partnerships. The involvement of leading telecommunications providers signals a strategic shift toward commercial off-the-shelf technology adaptation for military applications, potentially setting a precedent for future defence procurement strategies worldwide. This collaboration demonstrates how public-private partnerships can accelerate technological innovation in critical infrastructure sectors while maintaining stringent security protocols.</p>
