<p>The Hong Kong Trade Development Council has endorsed the 2025 Policy Address, which outlines comprehensive measures to strengthen Hong Kong's position as a global trade and business hub. The policy initiatives focus on deepening international exchange and cooperation while supporting mainland enterprises in overseas expansion through Hong Kong's platform.</p><p>Key measures include the establishment of a Task Force on Supporting Mainland Enterprises in Going Global and the creation of an Economic and Trade Express involving Economic and Trade Offices along with overseas offices of InvestHK and the HKTDC. These initiatives are designed to help both Hong Kong and mainland companies access new markets and business opportunities globally. The government is also injecting $1.43 billion into the BUD Fund to support business development.</p><p>Professor Frederick Ma, Chairman of the HKTDC, emphasized that these measures demonstrate the government's commitment to showcasing Hong Kong's role as a superconnector and high value-added supply chain service center. The HKTDC will leverage its network of 51 offices in mainland China and overseas, along with its extensive experience in business matching through conferences and exhibitions, to support these initiatives.</p><p>The policy address also focuses on strengthening intellectual property financing at the <a href="https://www.bipaforum.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Business of IP Asia Forum</a> to promote Hong Kong as a regional IP trading center. Additionally, the government will support the continued organization of the Hong Kong Shopping Festival under the HKTDC's E-Commerce Express, targeting mainland and ASEAN e-commerce markets.</p><p>Digital transformation initiatives form another critical component of the policy, with the proposed implementation of the Creativity â€¢ E-commerce - Beyond Limits programme by organizations including the Hong Kong SAR Trade and Industry Department and the HKTDC. These efforts aim to promote the digitalization of trade to reduce costs and improve efficiency for businesses operating through Hong Kong.</p><p>The comprehensive approach addresses the significant changes occurring in international trade and supply chains, positioning Hong Kong to capitalize on its unique advantages as a connector linking Mainland China with global markets. The HKTDC has committed to aligning with national development strategies and government policy directions to support small and medium-sized enterprises while attracting mainland companies to use Hong Kong as their platform for global expansion.</p>
