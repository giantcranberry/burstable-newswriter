<p>GRE Alpha Electronics and GRE Manufacturing will participate in the EnOcean Alliance Summit 2025 in Frankfurt, Germany, marking a strategic expansion into the European market following successful growth in North America and Asia. The companies will demonstrate their wireless control innovations that address key challenges in building automation by eliminating additional control wiring and reducing installation complexity.</p><p>At the summit, GRE Alpha will showcase its latest EnOcean Wireless LED Dimming Module, which enables smooth, flicker-free dimming with energy harvesting wireless switches. The module supports multiple regional frequencies including 902MHz for North America, 928MHz for Japan, and 868MHz for Europe and China, designed for seamless integration into both existing and new automation projects. Complementing the dimming module, GRE Alpha will also demonstrate the ENO-LUNA universal energy harvesting wireless switch available in both European and US form factors.</p><p>The ENO-LUNA utilizes an electro-dynamic energy transducer that converts rocker movement into electrical energy, powering maintenance-free Bluetooth Low Energy transmission. Every rocker press or release generates the energy needed to transmit button status, eliminating the need for batteries or external power sources while providing reliable wireless control. This technology represents a significant advancement in sustainable building automation solutions.</p><p>The joint participation highlights the complementary strengths of both companies, combining GRE Alpha's expertise in LED power solutions and wireless control technology with GRE Manufacturing's capabilities as a premier contract manufacturer. This partnership enables comprehensive support for multinational customers from initial design through final delivery, with manufacturing facilities including their Vietnam location supporting global operations.</p><p>The companies' wireless control solutions support applications across architectural lighting, commercial installations, industrial environments, and smart building integration, offering architects, lighting designers, and OEMs complete flexibility in their project requirements. The technology addresses the growing demand for energy-efficient solutions that reduce installation costs while providing enhanced control flexibility through wireless connectivity.</p><p>During the two-day summit, attendees will experience industry panel discussions, technology showcases, and networking sessions focused on wireless control, energy harvesting technologies, and building automation innovations. The <a href="https://www.enocean-alliance.org" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">EnOcean Alliance Summit</a> serves as a vital platform for demonstrating cutting-edge innovations to B2B decision-makers, procurement managers, and OEMs seeking reliable, energy-efficient wireless solutions for intelligent building systems.</p>
