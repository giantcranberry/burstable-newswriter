<p>Byline Bank has launched a sponsorship of the Chicago Transit Authority's <a href="https://www.transitchicago.com/128" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">#128 Soldier Field Express bus route</a> for the Chicago Bears' 2025-2026 season, marking a strategic move to enhance visibility among its target audience of local business owners and entrepreneurs. The partnership comes as the Chicago-based community bank approaches $10 billion in assets and completes a brand refresh, seeking to differentiate itself from larger regional and national competitors.</p><p>Karmen Conrad, Senior Vice President and Head of Marketing at Byline Bank, explained that the sponsorship provides exclusive access to Bears fans who overlap with the bank's core demographic. Beyond game days, the buses will operate on high-traffic routes throughout Chicago, offering daily brand exposure across the city. This initiative aligns with Byline's mission to support Chicagoland communities, emphasizing the bank's connection to local neighborhoods and its role in helping businesses thrive.</p><p>The campaign addresses market research indicating an opportunity to strengthen brand awareness. Conrad noted that building familiarity is essential for establishing trust, particularly as businesses seek reliable financial partners during periods of economic volatility. Byline positions itself as offering personalized service and deep local expertise, contrasting with the perceived impersonal nature of larger banks. The bank's approach proved valuable during challenges like the COVID-19 pandemic, where clients appreciated accessible, relationship-based support.</p><p>Byline's growth has been largely organic, with a focus on sustaining expansion within Chicago rather than pursuing national reach. The bank's bankers bring decades of experience serving the local market, providing advisory support tailored to regional economic conditions. This sponsorship reflects Byline's commitment to reinvesting in the community and supporting businesses that contribute to the city's vitality.</p><p>Initial response to the campaign has been positive, with noticeable buzz since its launch. Conrad highlighted the collaborative effort involving team members whose creative contributions brought the initiative to life. The sponsorship not only promotes Byline's services but also underscores its identity as a community-focused institution dedicated to Chicago's long-term prosperity.</p>
