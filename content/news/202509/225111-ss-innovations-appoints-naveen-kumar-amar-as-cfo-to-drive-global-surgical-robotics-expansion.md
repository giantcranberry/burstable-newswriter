<p>SS Innovations International has appointed Naveen Kumar Amar as the company's Chief Financial Officer effective September 24, 2025, marking a permanent leadership transition from Dr. Vishwa Srivastava, who served as interim CFO since July 2025 and will continue as Chief Executive Officer for Asia Pacific. The appointment comes at a critical juncture as the company seeks to expand the international presence of its SSi Mantra surgical robotic system, which is designed to make robotic surgery more affordable and accessible.</p><p>Amar brings more than 25 years of global finance leadership experience to SS Innovations, with expertise spanning financial accounting, corporate finance, treasury operations, and compliance with both U.S. and Indian accounting standards. His recognition as one of India's top financial executives by publications including <a href="https://www.forbesindia.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Forbes India</a> and <a href="https://www.forbesasia.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Forbes Asia</a> underscores his qualifications for the role during the company's global expansion phase.</p><p>Dr. Sudhir Srivastava, Chairman and CEO of SS Innovations, emphasized the strategic importance of this appointment. "Amar brings to SS Innovations a strong track record of building best-in-class finance operations and successful businesses across diverse industries and geographies," Srivastava stated. The leadership change aligns with increasing demand for cost-effective surgical robotics solutions worldwide, particularly in emerging markets where traditional robotic surgery systems have been prohibitively expensive.</p><p>The SSi Mantra system represents a significant advancement in surgical technology, featuring modular robotic arms, advanced 3D imaging capabilities, and support for over 40 different types of robotic instruments. Clinical validation in India has demonstrated the system's effectiveness across more than 100 surgical procedures, particularly in cardiac surgery. The company's mission focuses on democratizing access to advanced surgical robotic care, addressing cost barriers that have limited adoption in many markets.</p><p>Amar's previous experience includes serving as Head of Finance for SpiceXpress, Global CFO for Munch Ado India Private Ltd., and senior financial roles with multinational corporations including GE India. His educational background includes qualifications from the <a href="https://www.icai.org" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Institute of Chartered Accountants of India</a> and the <a href="https://www.icsi.edu" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Institute of Company Secretaries of India</a>, complemented by a Bachelor of Commerce degree from University of Delhi.</p><p>This leadership appointment signals SS Innovations' commitment to strengthening its financial operations as the company scales its global footprint. Amar's extensive cross-border financial experience positions the company to navigate complex international markets while maintaining its focus on affordability and accessibility in surgical robotics. The timing coincides with growing market demand for innovative healthcare solutions that can bridge the gap between advanced medical technology and cost constraints, particularly in developing economies where surgical robotics adoption has historically lagged due to pricing barriers.</p>
