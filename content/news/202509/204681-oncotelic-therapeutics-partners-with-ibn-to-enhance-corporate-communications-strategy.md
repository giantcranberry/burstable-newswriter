<p>Oncotelic Therapeutics, Inc. has selected IBN to lead its corporate communications efforts as the clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company advances therapies for difficult-to-treat and rare conditions. The engagement focuses on enhancing visibility among investors, medical professionals, and the broader healthcare community as Oncotelic progresses its pipeline of RNA-based immunotherapy and targeted treatments.</p><p>The company's lead candidate, OT-101, is currently in a Phase 3 trial for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, one of the most challenging cancer types with limited treatment options. This partnership with IBN, which provides specialized communications services through its https://www.biomedwire.com platform, represents a strategic move to effectively communicate Oncotelic's progress and potential to stakeholders.</p><p>Led by Chairman and CEO Dr. Vuong Trieu, co-inventor of the cancer drug Abraxane, Oncotelic is building a multi-asset pipeline supported by its proprietary AI platform PDAOAI. The corporate communications strategy will focus on highlighting the company's mission to address high-unmet-need cancers and rare pediatric indications with innovative, late-stage therapeutic candidates.</p><p>IBN's comprehensive communications platform offers access to wire solutions through https://www.investorwire.com, article syndication to more than 5,000 outlets, enhanced press release services, and social media distribution. This infrastructure will help Oncotelic maintain visibility as it advances clinical programs targeting aggressive solid tumors and pediatric cancers.</p><p>The partnership comes at a critical juncture for Oncotelic, which maintains a 45% stake in GMP Biotechnology Limited, a joint venture with Dragon Capital Overseas Limited that has the capacity to support regulatory filings for up to 20 drug candidates. Dr. Trieu's extensive intellectual property portfolio, including over 150 patent applications and 39 issued U.S. patents, further strengthens the company's position in the competitive biopharmaceutical landscape.</p><p>For business and technology leaders monitoring the intersection of AI and healthcare, this development underscores how specialized communications strategies are becoming increasingly important for biotech companies advancing complex therapeutic platforms. Effective stakeholder communication can significantly impact investor confidence and market positioning for companies developing treatments for underserved medical conditions.</p>
