<p>TenCate has initiated a comprehensive national campaign to showcase its Pivot Performance Turf system, featuring interactive Field Days that transform local sports fields into demonstration laboratories. These events allow athletic directors, coaches, athletes, architects, and municipal decision-makers to experience firsthand how the synthetic turf replicates the feel and performance of natural grass while eliminating traditional turf drawbacks.</p><p>The campaign includes biometric sensor technology that tracks athletes' movements in real-time, providing data that confirms Pivot's grass-like performance characteristics. Dr. Colin Young, Global Director of R&D at TenCate, emphasized the value of this experiential approach, stating that seeing and experiencing the performance firsthand is invaluable for decision-makers.</p><p>Charlie Beets, League and Tournament Director of 3&2 Baseball Club in Lenexa, Kansas, where the first Field Day was held, called Pivot a gamechanger for their complex, noting that the turf maintains its appearance even after heavy use by more than 6,000 program participants and 3,000 tournament teams annually.</p><p>The national initiative extends beyond physical demonstrations to include digital education and advertising components. TenCate has expanded its <a href="https://www.playingforkeeps.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Playing for Keeps website</a>, which serves as a comprehensive digital hub featuring product comparisons, specifications, warranty details, and case studies from educational institutions that have implemented the technology.</p><p>Pivot Performance Turf represents years of research and development from TenCate's Center for Turf Innovation, offering several environmental and performance advantages. The system requires no performance infill, reducing plastic shedding by up to 99% and eliminating black rubber pellets. It boasts up to 50% longer lifespan than conventional turf systems, higher fiber density for a more natural grass-like surface, and meets rigorous safety standards including California Proposition 65 requirements and FIFA, NCAA, and NFL testing criteria.</p><p>Joe Fields, President and CEO of TenCate Americas, described Pivot as giving athletes the performance they want and sports facilities the reliability they need. The turf system is backed by an industry-first 12-year warranty and is regionally recyclable at the end of its operational life, addressing growing concerns about synthetic turf sustainability.</p><p>The campaign aims to redefine expectations for synthetic turf by demonstrating how advanced engineering can combine the playability of natural grass with the durability, reliability, and environmental benefits of modern synthetic systems. This initiative comes at a time when sports facilities nationwide are seeking sustainable alternatives that maintain high performance standards while reducing maintenance costs and environmental impact.</p>
