<p>pgEdge, a prominent open source enterprise Postgres company, announced two significant developments: the release of pgEdge Enterprise Postgres and the company's complete transition to open source licensing for its distributed Postgres components. This move expands pgEdge's offerings to support both distributed and non-distributed PostgreSQL applications while maintaining full compatibility with standard PostgreSQL.</p><p>The pgEdge Enterprise Postgres distribution provides organizations with enterprise-grade reliability, manageability, and support for scaling PostgreSQL across demanding workloads. Key features include high availability for both distributed and non-distributed workloads, full support for PostgreSQL v16, v17, and upcoming v18, and enterprise-ready extensions such as pgAudit, pgBackrest, pgBouncer, PostGIS, and pgVector. The distribution also includes browser and desktop-based management through <a href="https://www.pgadmin.org" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">pgAdmin</a> and supports various deployment options including virtual machines, containers for Kubernetes, OpenShift, and Docker/Docker Swarm.</p><p>Concurrently, pgEdge announced that all distributed Postgres components are now fully open source under the PostgreSQL License approved by the Open Source Initiative. This includes the Spock multi-master logical replication extension, Large Object Logical Replication (LOLOR) extension, and Snowflake Sequences, all available on <a href="https://github.com/pgEdge" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Github</a>. Previously released under the pgEdge Community License, these projects now operate under one of the industry's most permissive open source licenses.</p><p>Phillip Merrick, Co-founder and CEO of pgEdge, stated that customers requested enterprise-class Postgres support for non-distributed workloads, leading to this expanded offering. The company's approach enables organizations to scale seamlessly from single Postgres instances to high availability configurations and globally distributed deployments while maintaining full alignment with the PostgreSQL community.</p><p>Dave Page, VP of Engineering at pgEdge and PostgreSQL Core Team member, emphasized the company's commitment to open source software and contributions to the PostgreSQL ecosystem. The licensing change supports broader community access and development while maintaining enterprise-grade capabilities.</p><p>pgEdge Enterprise Postgres VM Edition is immediately available as part of a paid subscription that includes tested builds, security updates, and 24x7x365 enterprise support. The container edition with Kubernetes Operator support will be available in Q4, with packages supported on various operating systems including Red Hat Enterprise Linux and derivatives. Optional services include dedicated Forward Deployed Engineer support, already trusted by Global 2000 companies and major government customers who have rated the company's support with a Net Promoter Score of 100.</p>
