<p>HG Insights has completed the acquisition of TrustRadius and MadKudu, creating what CEO Rohini Kasturi describes as a definitive go-to-market platform for B2B marketing, sales, strategy, and revenue operations teams. The strategic move addresses a major challenge facing B2B companies: bridging the gap between market insights and marketing and sales execution.</p><p>The acquisition unites HG Insights' market and account intelligence with TrustRadius' reliable B2B buyer intelligence and MadKudu's advanced predictive intelligence. TrustRadius brings authentic customer voices through validated reviews and intent data, while MadKudu adds predictive scoring to qualify and prioritize opportunities with precision. This combination enables demand generation and sales teams to gain contextualized buyer insights, identify in-market leads, and accelerate pipeline and revenue outcomes.</p><p>Kasturi explained that the integrated platform helps teams not only identify target accounts and accounts at risk of churn but also understand which prospects are most likely to convert and when. Customers can connect directly with active buyers via <a href="https://trustradius.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">TrustRadius</a> while leveraging MadKudu's AI-driven scoring to focus resources on the highest-impact opportunities.</p><p>The company's Revenue Growth Intelligence (RGI) platform captures, integrates, and processes massive, diverse data points across traditionally siloed domains. RGI utilizes advanced analytics to detect deep "behind the firewall" customer data, allowing for precise marketing and account targeting while extracting insights about technographics, cloud usage, and competitive intelligence including contract and services data.</p><p>With the recent launch of RGI Fabric and Market Analyzer Copilot, HG Insights draws from over 28 billion market source files, 2 billion intent records, 20+ million companies, and 200+ million tech install and IT spend detections. The AI-native product represents the company's commitment to delivering intelligence that enables customers to scale revenue efficiently, strengthen customer retention, and enhance operational execution.</p><p>The acquisitions position HG Insights uniquely in the B2B market intelligence space by combining optimal data sets and buyer intent contextualization to deliver high-propensity accounts and in-market leads that provide the fastest path to revenue. The platform now offers industry-leading buyer intent data and in-market lead generation within a unified environment, helping companies accelerate revenue generation through more accurate targeting and engagement strategies.</p>
