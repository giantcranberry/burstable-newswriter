<p>TOMY International, in collaboration with Universal Products & Experiences, has announced a limited-edition die-cast replica of the K.I.T.T. car from the Knight Rider television series, available for pre-order from September 23 to October 23, 2025. This crowd-funded project aims to produce a highly detailed 1:10 scale model, featuring advanced interactive elements such as voice recognition, functional LED lights, and transformation modes, priced at $399 USD for markets in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom.</p><p>Morgan Weyl, Managing Director of Licensing and Global Development at TOMY International, emphasized the replica's nostalgic and technological appeal, stating it transports fans to an iconic era in television history. The model includes collector-cherished features like a Super Pursuit Mode transformation, Ski Mode display option, light effects, and a voice recognition interface that allows interaction with the legendary voice of K.I.T.T. The announcement will be supported by a digital campaign targeting Knight Rider enthusiasts, with previews available on <a href="https://knightrider-signup.tomy.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://knightrider-signup.tomy.com</a>.</p><p>The K.I.T.T. replica measures 10 inches by 8.25 inches by 5.25 inches when closed, constructed with die-cast metal parts, and expands to 21 inches by 10.5 inches by 6.5 inches with activated Super Pursuit Mode and Emergency Brake System panels. Additional features include a rotating license plate, light-up dashboard, LED screen, hidden touch sensors, and a specifically designed collectible cutaway poster by Matthew Cushman. Production will commence after reaching a goal of 3,000 pieces, with delivery scheduled for early 2027, weighing approximately 8 pounds and packaged in premium collector packaging.</p><p>This initiative represents the second crowd-funded collaboration between TOMY and Universal, highlighting a growing trend in leveraging fan communities to bring niche, high-quality collectibles to market. The replica's integration of voice interaction and accurate TV series details not only caters to dedicated collectors but also preserves cultural heritage from the 1980s television landscape, making it a noteworthy addition to memorabilia offerings.</p>
