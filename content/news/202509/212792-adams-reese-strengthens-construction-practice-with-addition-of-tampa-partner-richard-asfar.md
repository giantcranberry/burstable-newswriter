<p>The AmLaw 200 firm Adams & Reese has expanded its nationally ranked construction practice with the addition of Richard "Ric" Asfar as partner in the Tampa office. Asfar brings nearly two decades of experience in construction litigation, insurance coverage, employment litigation, appellate advocacy, and commercial disputes, representing a diverse client base including individuals, government entities, interest groups, and businesses.</p><p>Asfar's credentials include maintaining an "AV-Preeminent" rating by Martindale-Hubbell since 2016 and recognition in multiple legal publications including Best Lawyers in America, Florida Super Lawyers, Florida Trend's "Legal Elite," and Tampa Magazine's "Top Lawyers." His addition comes at a time when the firm's construction practice has grown into one of the largest in the country under the leadership of Construction Practice Group Leader Chris Derden and Construction Team Leaders David Toney and Trent Cotney.</p><p>Trent Cotney, who previously worked with Asfar at <a href="https://www.cotneycl.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Cotney Attorneys & Consultants</a>, emphasized Asfar's value to the firm, stating: "Ric has a well-deserved reputation as an exceptionally detail-oriented litigator who stays ahead of the curve on litigation trends and legislative changes in construction law. Ric's unparalleled familiarity with the local construction industry and the unique litigation landscape of Tampa makes him a tremendous addition." The firm's construction group now comprises close to 100 attorneys licensed in more than 35 states, with <a href="https://www.constructionexec.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Construction Executive</a> ranking Adams & Reese among the Top 20 construction law firms for three consecutive years.</p><p>Asfar joins a Tampa office that features approximately 30 construction attorneys, including Florida Bar board-certified construction lawyers, AAA and Florida-certified arbitrators, construction mediators with extensive dispute resolution experience, general counsels of roofing associations, and former general contractors. This concentration of expertise creates a unique environment for handling complex construction matters. Asfar expressed enthusiasm about joining the team, noting: "The Tampa office is unique in its construction focus with people at the forefront of thought leadership on the intersection of construction and law."</p><p>The strategic hiring strengthens Adams & Reese's position in the competitive construction law market, particularly in Florida where construction activity continues to grow. Asfar's extensive experience in complex construction defect cases, construction delays, insurance disputes, catastrophic injury claims, bond claims, lien claims, and employment matters provides the firm with enhanced capabilities to serve clients facing the industry's most challenging legal issues. His reputation as "a lawyer's lawyer" among peers who seek his counsel on difficult legal matters further enhances the firm's value proposition to clients navigating complex construction litigation.</p>
