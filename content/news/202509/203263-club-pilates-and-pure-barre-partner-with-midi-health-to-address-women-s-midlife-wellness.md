<p>Club Pilates and Pure Barre have announced a strategic partnership with Midi Health, a virtual clinic specializing in women's midlife health, to launch the 'Strong Through Every Stage' campaign running from September 9, 2025, through February 28, 2026. The initiative will provide members of both fitness brands with comprehensive educational content, resources, workshops, and events focused on hormone health, peri/menopause management, longevity, and aging well, available across all 50 states.</p><p>The campaign will feature experiential workshops with Midi clinicians in select Club Pilates and Pure Barre studios nationwide, starting in the Bay Area, Chicago, Houston, Indianapolis, and Washington DC. These workshops will address science-backed solutions tailored to women's midlife health needs, including disease prevention, beauty, and sexual health. Steve Pankowski, Executive Vice President of Strategic Partnerships at Xponential Fitness, emphasized that healthy living extends beyond physical exercise, stating that attention to hormonal health and menopause management is crucial for helping members be strong from the inside out.</p><p>Midi Health, founded by women for women, has gained the trust of over 200,000 women across the U.S. by providing insurance-covered care through expert clinicians, with 91% of patients reporting symptom improvement within 60 days of starting their programs. The virtual care clinic is committed to destigmatizing menopause and expanding its focus to address all aspects of midlife health.

Participating studios at Club Pilates and Pure Barre are offering an exclusive opportunity for existing Midi customers to incorporate low-impact, muscle-building workouts into their holistic wellness journey. This partnership represents a significant shift in the fitness industry's approach to women's health, recognizing that comprehensive wellness requires integration of physical exercise with specialized medical knowledge and support for midlife transitions.</p><p>The collaboration between established fitness brands and a specialized healthcare provider signals growing recognition of the substantial market opportunity in women's midlife health services. With an aging population and increased focus on preventive healthcare, such partnerships may become more common as businesses seek to address comprehensive wellness needs beyond traditional fitness offerings. This initiative could set a precedent for other fitness companies to form similar healthcare partnerships, potentially transforming how the industry approaches member wellness and retention strategies.</p>
