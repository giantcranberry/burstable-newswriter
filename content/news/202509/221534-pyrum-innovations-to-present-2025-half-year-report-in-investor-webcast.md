<p>Pyrum Innovations AG will host an investor webcast on September 26, 2025, at 11:00 a.m. CEST, featuring the executive board's presentation of the company's half-year report for 2025. CEO Pascal Klein and CFO Kai Winkelmann will discuss financial performance, current business developments, and future outlook during the 60-minute English-language presentation, which includes a question-and-answer session following the formal remarks.</p><p>The timing of this presentation is significant as Pyrum continues to expand its operations in the sustainable recycling market. The company's revolutionary thermolysis technology, developed since 2008, enables virtually emission-free recycling of end-of-life tires and plastics. This process recovers high-quality products including thermolysis oil and recovered Carbon Black (rCB), which are used by industry partners such as BASF, Continental and Schwalbe to manufacture new products. More information about the company's technology and operations is available at <a href="https://www.pyrum.net/en/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.pyrum.net/en/</a>.</p><p>Pyrum's approach supports circular economy principles and aligns with global climate targets, positioning the company at the forefront of sustainable materials innovation. The company's first plant at its Dillingen/Saar headquarters has been in continuous operation since 2020, with two additional facilities added during the 2024 site expansion. This expansion reflects growing demand for Pyrum's certified products, which have earned respected certifications including REACH and ISCC Plus, ensuring their high-quality, sustainable, and renewable characteristics.</p><p>For business and technology leaders, Pyrum's progress represents important developments in the circular economy and sustainable materials sectors. The company's partnerships with major industrial players demonstrate the commercial viability of advanced recycling technologies and the growing market acceptance of recycled materials in manufacturing supply chains. Investors will be particularly interested in understanding how the company's expansion projects and strategic partnerships are contributing to its business development and financial performance.</p><p>The webcast provides stakeholders with critical insights into Pyrum's financial health and strategic direction as the company capitalizes on the growing sustainable materials market. With multiple awards for its innovative recycling solutions and ongoing research into additional waste stream applications, Pyrum's technology has implications for reducing industrial carbon footprints and creating more sustainable manufacturing processes worldwide. The company's success could accelerate adoption of similar technologies across industries seeking to meet sustainability targets and reduce dependence on virgin materials.</p>
