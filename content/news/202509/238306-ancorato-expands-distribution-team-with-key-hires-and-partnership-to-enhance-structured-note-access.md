<p>Ancorato, a specialized money manager focused on objective-oriented structured note strategies, has significantly expanded its distribution capabilities with the addition of multiple financial industry professionals and a strategic partnership. The firm announced the hiring of Patrick LeBlanc as vice president of capital markets for the East region, Andrew Burghardt as vice president of capital markets for the West region, and Thomas Monaghan as advisor concierge, along with a partnership with industry veteran Joanna Venetch for national accounts services.</p><p>Pisoot Senethavilay, president of Ancorato, emphasized that these professionals collectively represent decades of experience in distribution, advisor support, and industry leadership. Their expertise reinforces the firm's commitment to providing financial advisors and their clients with exceptional service, trusted relationships, and positive partnership experiences. This expansion comes at a time when financial advisors are increasingly seeking sophisticated investment solutions that can help clients navigate market volatility while managing downside risk.</p><p>In their regional capital markets roles, LeBlanc and Burghardt will focus on building relationships with current and new financial advisors to expand access to Ancorato's innovative structured note strategies. LeBlanc will cover Central and Eastern time zones, bringing 15 years of experience in alternative investments, real estate, and structured products, along with expertise in independent broker-dealer and registered investment advisor channels. Burghardt, covering Pacific and Mountain time zones, contributes more than 20 years of financial industry experience ranging from traditional investments to alternatives such as private equity and venture capital.</p><p>As advisor concierge, Monaghan will streamline the advisor experience from initial onboarding through ongoing portfolio management. He will provide individualized direct reporting, portfolio position tracking, and one-on-one platform onboarding for StrategyLink, Ancorato's advisor-friendly platform that connects directly with the advisor's firm and custodian. This eliminates the need for a second account typically required in traditional separately managed accounts, potentially reducing administrative burdens for financial advisors.</p><p>The partnership with Joanna Venetch brings additional industry leadership to Ancorato's national account efforts. Venetch, who founded Hana Solutions in 2020 to support alternative investment firms navigating the independent broker-dealer and RIA landscape, currently serves as president-elect of the Board of Directors of ADISA and brings more than 22 years of financial services experience to the collaboration.</p><p>Founded in 2019, Ancorato has developed a distinctive, rules-based investment process that delivers objective-oriented structured notes through separately managed accounts. The firm offers six different income and growth strategies designed to help investors navigate volatility and mitigate downside risk. Since inception, Ancorato has launched more than 370 structured notes, with nearly 51% going full cycle as of August 31, 2025. Additional information about the firm's approach and resources is available at <a href="https://www.ancoratocapital.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.ancoratocapital.com</a>.</p><p>This expansion of distribution capabilities signals Ancorato's strategic focus on increasing market penetration at a time when structured products are gaining traction among investors seeking customized risk-return profiles. The regional coverage model combined with enhanced advisor support services positions the firm to better serve the evolving needs of financial advisors and their clients in an increasingly complex investment landscape.</p>
