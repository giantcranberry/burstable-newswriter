<p>Brian Bejile, Chief Executive Officer of Octaura, brings two decades of trading experience to his mission of modernizing fixed income markets. His career began on the trading desk at Citi, where he witnessed firsthand the manual and inefficient processes for trading Collateralized Loan Obligations (CLOs) and syndicated loans. That experience, combined with his team's work building trading functionality on <a href="https://www.citivelocity.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">CitiVelocity</a>, demonstrated how technology could fundamentally transform these markets.</p><p>Bejile's time as a trader shaped Octaura's DNA, as he observed how much time was wasted on repetitive manual tasks like spreadsheets, phone calls, and emails to chase bid information. He began working on automation alternatives to streamline processes, eventually reaching out to founding investors including Bank of America, Credit Suisse, Goldman Sachs, J.P. Morgan, Morgan Stanley, Wells Fargo, and Moody's Analytics. This consortium became "Project Octopus," which evolved into Octaura, officially launched in 2022 to deliver the liquidity, transparency, and efficiency Bejile wished he had access to as a trader.</p><p>Octaura represents the first electronic trading platform designed for both syndicated loans and CLOs, two interconnected markets that have historically lacked automation. The platform launched its syndicated loan trading protocols, real-time data and analytics in 2023, while the new <a href="https://www.octaura.com/clo-platform" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">CLO platform</a> introduces real-time execution, full bid transparency, and analytics that provide greater visibility to the CLO market. With 27 dealers and 160 buy-side firms already onboarded, Octaura helps unlock access to more liquidity as adoption scales.</p><p>The platform has achieved significant milestones, including capturing nearly 6% market share of all leveraged loans traded in the secondary market. The CLO platform launched with 50 buy-side firms and a dozen dealers, with beta phase feedback showing execution times dropping from 90 minutes to under 30 minutes in some cases. Industry leaders have praised the transformation, with Tom Majewski of Eagle Point Credit Management calling it "amazing to see the CLO secondary market come out of the Stone Age," while David Trepanier of Bank of America described the launch as "a watershed moment for the market."</p><p>Bejile emphasizes that adoption couldn't be forced, so Octaura was designed to enhance rather than replace legacy workflows. By digitizing familiar processes like BWIC lists but adding transparency, speed, and analytics, the platform shows immediate value without requiring participants to change how they trade. The secondary loan market currently trades at $200 billion annually, only a fraction of the $1.2 trillion market size, indicating significant growth potential as technology adoption increases.</p><p>Following a multi-million-dollar funding round, Octaura's focus remains on improving efficiency while laying groundwork for long-term market growth. The platform's proven protocols, data offerings, and platforms create a foundation for a seamless trading ecosystem that addresses efficiency and transparency issues inherent to asset classes in the broader loan market. Bejile sees Octaura providing infrastructure that matches the scale of this trillion-dollar market at an inflection point, positioning the company at the forefront of shaping its future evolution.</p>
