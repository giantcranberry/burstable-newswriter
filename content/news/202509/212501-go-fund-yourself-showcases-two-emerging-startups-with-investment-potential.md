<p>Episode 7 of Go Fund Yourself on Cheddar TV featured two emerging companies with significant investor potential: Want Italy, a modern Italian dining concept at New York City's Oculus, and MVP Kids, a social-emotional learning platform focused on building children's resilience and character. The national television exposure provides both startups with access to millions of viewers, mentorship from industry experts, and direct investment opportunities through campaigns.</p><p>Want Italy is redefining fast-casual dining at the bustling Oculus/World Trade Center location with its Pasta & Go concept that combines theater-style preparation with impulse retail and delivery integrations. The model creates multiple revenue streams beyond traditional dining, featuring chefs preparing dishes to order alongside espresso and curated Italian retail products. Investors see potential in scaling the authentic experience to other high-traffic locations, though challenges remain in consistent chef training and sourcing authentic Italian ingredients.

The Inspire Character® brand focuses on four pillars—Nurture Literacy, Cultivate Mentorship, Expand Education, and Enrich Entertainment—to help children develop empathy, integrity, and community skills. With 77 published titles, family and classroom kits, and partnerships across education and retail channels, MVP Kids represents both an impact-focused and commercially scalable venture. The primary challenge involves achieving broad distribution and curriculum adoption at scale.

For Want Italy, this exposure could accelerate expansion into new markets, while for MVP Kids, it means distributing social-emotional learning tools to more classrooms and families nationwide.
