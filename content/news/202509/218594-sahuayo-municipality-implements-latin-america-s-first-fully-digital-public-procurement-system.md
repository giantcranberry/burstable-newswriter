<p>The Municipality of Sahuayo has implemented a Digital Public Procurement One-Stop Shop, establishing itself as the first municipality in Michoac√°n and among the pioneering local governments in Latin America to adopt a completely paperless procurement system. This technological advancement represents a significant step forward in modernizing public administration and optimizing resource allocation for municipal operations.</p><p>Developed in partnership with <a href="https://glass.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Glass</a>, a Silicon Valley technology company specializing in digital procurement solutions, the platform utilizes the G-Commerce system already deployed by various U.S. local governments and federal agencies. Following Mexico City's collaboration with the technology provider, Sahuayo becomes the first Mexican municipality to implement this specific procurement technology, processing more than 700 purchase requests within the first two months of operation.</p><p>The digital transformation addresses Sahuayo's annual budget management of nearly $340 million Mexican pesos (approximately USD $17-18 million), which previously relied on manual, paper-intensive processes requiring physical paperwork and in-person signatures. More than 45 active municipal departments have integrated the platform into their daily operations, including critical sectors such as Public Safety, Water Services, Public Works, and Economic Development. The rapid adoption across diverse municipal functions demonstrates the system's effectiveness in replacing outdated bureaucratic procedures with streamlined digital workflows.</p><p>A key feature of the platform is its intelligent supplier directory designed specifically to empower Sahuayo's local business community. Small shops, women-led enterprises, and other vital contributors to the municipal economy can now register and connect directly with government procurement opportunities. The municipality aims to progressively onboard more than 60 local suppliers, creating an inclusive ecosystem where businesses can participate transparently in government contracting processes.</p><p>Alexander Morillo, Government Projects Lead at Glass, emphasized that the transition from manual to digital processes maximizes public resources and enables municipal leaders to focus on citizen service rather than administrative paperwork. The platform provides municipal staff with a comprehensive purchasing dashboard where they can create requests, submit them with a single click, and track progress in real-time through review and approval workflows.</p><p>Sahuayo plans to expand the platform's capabilities to cover petty cash transactions, emergency purchases, direct acquisitions, and larger-scale procurement activities, all within a fully digital, auditable environment. This strategic expansion positions Sahuayo as a regional benchmark for how technological innovation can drive local development and modern governance practices. The municipality's initiative aligns with broader trends in public sector digitalization, as Glass has supported more than 120 public agencies across the United States and Latin America in transitioning to intelligent procurement platforms.</p><p>The technology provider's selection by the <a href="https://www.gsa.gov" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">U.S. General Services Administration</a> for its federal commercial platforms program and recent launch of the first G-Commerce platform in Latin America with the Government of Puerto Rico underscores the growing recognition of digital procurement's importance in public sector efficiency. For business and technology leaders monitoring public sector innovation, Sahuayo's implementation demonstrates how municipalities can leverage technology to create more transparent, efficient, and inclusive government operations while supporting local economic development through improved access to procurement opportunities.</p>
