<p>Breacher.ai has released Agentic AI Education & Simulation Bots designed to provide customized security training against modern deepfake threats. Traditional security training methods have proven inadequate against AI-powered attacks, prompting the development of this innovative solution that uses companies' own executive voices and likenesses in interactive simulations.</p><p>Initial testing data indicates a 50% reduction in user susceptibility to deepfake attacks after role-playing with the bots. The technology enables instant simulation with executive likeness, cloning voices for authentic phishing, vishing, and social engineering scenarios without requiring IT integration. Recent simulations conducted by Breacher.ai reveal that 78% of organizations initially struggle to withstand deepfake-based social engineering attacks.</p><p>However, after hands-on exposure using executive-based Agentic Bots, over half of users demonstrate improved resilience and decision-making capabilities under pressure. The solution provides behavioral insights and reporting, allowing organizations to gather real data on user responses to convincing AI threats and identify security gaps that traditional awareness training might miss.</p><p>Every simulation is built with full executive consent and serves clear educational purposes, featuring customizable role-playing scenarios and interactive sessions. Users can experience Agentic AI and deepfake technologies in a controlled environment through the educational platform at https://breacher.ai. The technology addresses the growing need for organizations to operationalize human-layer security against increasingly sophisticated AI deepfake threats.</p><p>This development represents a significant advancement in cybersecurity training, providing measurable data that security leaders can use to justify investments in modern defense systems. The ability to simulate realistic attack scenarios using actual executive voices creates a more impactful learning experience that traditional training methods cannot match.</p>
