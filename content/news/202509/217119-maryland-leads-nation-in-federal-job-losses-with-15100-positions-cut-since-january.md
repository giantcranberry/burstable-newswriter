<p>Maryland lost another 2,500 federal jobs in August, marking the second consecutive month that the state has led the nation in federal job losses according to numbers released by the Maryland Department of Labor. The August numbers brought the total number of federal jobs lost in the state to 15,100 since January, when President Donald Trump took office and began his campaign to slash the size of the federal workforce. This year-to-date total represents the most significant federal job losses in the United States.</p><p>The August job numbers count positions located within the state, meaning Maryland has lost almost 10% of its federal jobs since the start of the year. Maryland's economy remains heavily dependent on the federal workforce, with an estimated 269,000 Maryland residents employed by the federal government in 2023 according to a report by the state's Labor Department available at https://www.dllr.state.md.us/employment/lmi/. There were 158,475 federal jobs located in the state that year.</p><p>Jake Pannell, a national business representative for the National Federation of Federal Employees, expressed concern about the regional economic impact. Many former workers have had to leave the region, and he worries about the lack of private-sector jobs for the variety of skillsets federal workers possess. Many of these individuals have decades of experience and are overqualified for other positions, Pannell explained, adding that some federal workers will either have to accept substantial pay cuts or undergo job re-entry programs that train them for jobs they're already greatly experienced at.</p><p>The federal job losses are expected to continue when the September numbers are released. As part of the push to reduce the federal workforce, federal employees were offered a deferred resignation option on January 28 that would allow them to receive pay and benefits until September 30. Workforce-wide declines are anticipated to appear in job loss figures at the end of September and through the remainder of the year as those positions come off the books, according to a statement from the Office of Personnel Management at https://www.opm.gov/.</p><p>The continuing job losses represent a substantial economic challenge for Maryland, where federal employment has long been a cornerstone of the state's economy. The concentration of experienced federal workers facing limited private-sector opportunities raises concerns about brain drain and economic stability in regions heavily dependent on government employment. The situation highlights the vulnerability of regional economies that rely heavily on federal spending and employment patterns.</p>
