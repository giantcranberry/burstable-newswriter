<p>Direxion has expanded its exchange-traded fund offerings with four new single-stock daily leveraged and inverse ETFs focused on Shopify Inc. and Lockheed Martin Corporation. These specialized funds provide tactical traders with amplified exposure to individual company movements, though they carry substantial risks that differ significantly from traditional ETFs or even other leveraged products.</p><p>The new offerings include the Direxion Daily SHOP Bull 2X ETF (NASDAQ: SHPU) and Direxion Daily SHOP Bear 1X ETF (NASDAQ: SHPD) for Shopify exposure, along with the Direxion Daily LMT Bull 2X ETF (NASDAQ: LMTL) and Direxion Daily LMT Bear 1X ETF (NASDAQ: LMTS) for Lockheed Martin. Unlike diversified ETFs that track broader indices, these funds concentrate on single stocks, eliminating diversification benefits and increasing concentration risk.</p><p>These leveraged and inverse ETFs pursue daily leveraged investment objectives, making them riskier than alternatives that do not use leverage. The funds are designed to emulate the daily performance of the underlying companies' common shares, with the bull funds seeking 200% of the daily return and the bear funds targeting 100% of the inverse daily performance. However, they are not expected to track the underlying stock's performance over periods longer than one day and are specifically intended for short-term trading strategies.</p><p>The inherent risks of these products are substantial. Investors should understand that the funds will lose money if the underlying stock's performance remains flat, and it's possible that bull funds could lose money even when the stock increases, while bear funds might lose money even when the stock decreases over periods longer than a single day. These characteristics make the ETFs unsuitable for all investors and appropriate only for those who understand leverage risk and actively manage their investments.</p><p>For traders seeking to capitalize on short-term directional movements in either Shopify or Lockheed Martin, these ETFs provide a mechanism to gain tactical exposure. The amplified exposure can translate to significant gains but also substantial losses, requiring careful risk management and thorough research before investment.
