<p>South Florida-based ArcticCollagen has developed a supplement delivering 8,000 mg of pure hydrolyzed marine collagen combined with 8 grams of lean protein, hyaluronic acid, and vitamin C in daily sachets. The company is highlighting collagen's significant impact on skin health and overall wellness, addressing growing market demand for accessible beauty and health solutions as American consumers increasingly seek convenient ways to maintain healthy, youthful-looking skin.</p><p>ArcticCollagen President Jasmien Winqvist emphasized collagen's fundamental role in the body, noting that it affects structures across every system. According to information from <a href="https://www.webmd.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">WebMD</a>, collagen constitutes approximately one-third of all protein in the human body, with its strong fibers functioning like glue to hold muscles, bones, tendons, ligaments, organs, and skin together. The company developed its formulation in response to collagen depletion caused by natural aging, sunlight exposure, smoking, and sugar consumption.</p><p>Scientific research supports collagen supplementation's benefits for skin health. A 2022 study published in Dermatology Practical & Conceptual and shared by the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">National Library of Medicine</a> compared oral and topical collagen options, concluding that both collagen supplements improve skin moisture, elasticity, and hydration when orally administered. The study also found collagen reduces wrinkling and roughness of the skin, with existing studies not finding any side effects of oral supplements.</p><p>ArcticCollagen's product uses type 1-rich collagen sourced from the skin of wild-caught Northern European white fish, cod, and salmon, hydrolyzed in Norway for optimal absorption. Available in strawberry and lemon flavors, the honey-like substance can be easily added to foods or consumed directly. The company recently gained exposure through industry events and celebrity connections, with products showcased at Florida's ECRM Vitamin, Weight Management & Sports Nutrition Session where they were presented to major retailers including GNC, Vitamin Shoppe, Vitamin World, Walmart, CVS, and Walgreens.</p><p>During Emmys Week in Beverly Hills, ArcticCollagen was included in luxurious swag bags distributed by CapAquarius Media through partnership with The Marianna Group, reaching reality TV stars, soap opera stars, Emmy nominees, producers, and directors. The supplement is currently available for purchase through <a href="https://www.onelavi.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">OneLavi.com</a>, Medpaid Market, and <a href="https://www.amazon.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Amazon.com</a>, with a 14-sachet package retailing for $47.99. The company's expansion reflects growing consumer interest in collagen supplementation as part of daily health and beauty routines.</p>
