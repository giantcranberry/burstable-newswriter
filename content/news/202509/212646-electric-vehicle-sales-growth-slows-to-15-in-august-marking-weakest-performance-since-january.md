The August figures suggest potential headwinds for the sector, which has been experiencing robust growth in recent years. The data provides crucial insights for investors, manufacturers, and policymakers monitoring the transition to electric transportation.</p><p>For more information about the research methodology and detailed findings, visit <a href="https://www.TechMediaWire.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.TechMediaWire.com</a>.
