<p>Bollinger Innovations, Inc. (NASDAQ: BINI) has completed a reverse stock split effective September 22, 2025, with company leadership pledging this will be the final such action for at least three years. The electric vehicle manufacturer stated the split was necessary to meet Nasdaq's minimum $1.00 bid price requirement, ensuring the company maintains its listing status and long-term market position.</p><p>CEO and Chairman David Michery emphasized that the strategic move positions Bollinger Innovations for focused growth and value creation while providing stability for investors. The company's commitment to avoiding further splits for three years represents a significant pledge to shareholders concerned about dilution and corporate stability. This announcement comes as the company reports strong commercial performance, having received more than $1 million in payments for commercial electric vehicles sold in August 2025.</p><p>The Southern California-based automotive company operates a U.S. manufacturing facility in Tunica, Mississippi, where it produces commercial electric vehicles including the ONE, a Class 1 EV cargo van, and THREE, a Class 3 EV cab chassis truck. Bollinger Innovations maintains a commercial dealer network consisting of six dealers providing sales and service coverage across key markets including the West Coast, Midwest, Pacific Northwest, and Mid-Atlantic regions.</p><p>Bollinger Motors, the company's established EV truck division based in Oak Park, Michigan, recently achieved significant milestones including the September 16, 2024 launch of its B4 Class 4 electric truck production. The division has developed an extensive dealer network with over 50 locations across the United States for comprehensive sales and service support. Investors can access the latest company updates through the official newsroom at <a href="https://ibn.fm/BINI" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://ibn.fm/BINI</a>.</p><p>The reverse stock split completion and the commitment against future splits for three years demonstrates management's confidence in the company's trajectory and financial stability. This corporate action, combined with recent commercial vehicle sales performance, suggests Bollinger Innovations is positioning itself for sustained growth in the competitive electric vehicle market while maintaining regulatory compliance and shareholder value.</p><p>For business leaders and technology investors, Bollinger's strategic moves signal a maturing company in the competitive EV space. The three-year moratorium on reverse splits provides crucial predictability for investment decisions, while the company's dual manufacturing approach—combining established truck production with newer commercial vehicle lines—demonstrates a diversified growth strategy. The $1 million in August commercial vehicle payments indicates tangible market traction beyond prototype development phases.</p><p>The maintenance of Nasdaq listing status through this corporate action ensures continued visibility and access to capital markets, critical for competing against larger EV manufacturers. Bollinger's geographic manufacturing and dealer distribution strategy covers key commercial vehicle markets, positioning the company to capitalize on regional EV adoption incentives and infrastructure development. This stability commitment comes at a pivotal time as commercial fleets accelerate electrification timelines, creating substantial market opportunities for specialized EV manufacturers.</p>
