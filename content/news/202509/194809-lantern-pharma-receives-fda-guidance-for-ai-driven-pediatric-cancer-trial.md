<p>Lantern Pharma Inc. has completed a Type C meeting with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration that provides critical regulatory guidance for the company's planned pediatric clinical trial targeting central nervous system cancers. The FDA-supported pathway includes a parallel cohort for Atypical Teratoid Rhabdoid Tumor patients and potential inclusion of spironolactone as a combination agent with LP-184/STAR-001, Lantern's lead investigational therapy developed using artificial intelligence.</p><p>The regulatory guidance represents a significant milestone for pediatric oncology drug development, particularly for rare cancers with limited treatment options. ATRT and other CNS cancers affecting children often have poor prognoses and few effective therapies available. The FDA's support for the trial design and combination approach validates Lantern's strategy and could accelerate the development timeline for potential new treatments.</p><p>Through its subsidiary Starlight Therapeutics, Lantern will submit an Investigational New Drug amendment incorporating the FDA feedback, with trial initiation targeted for the first quarter of 2026. The multi-site study will focus on progression-free survival, overall response rate, and quality-of-life outcomes, addressing both efficacy and patient experience measures. The program already holds Rare Pediatric Disease and Orphan Drug designations, which provide regulatory incentives and market exclusivity benefits for drugs targeting rare conditions.</p><p>Lantern's approach leverages its proprietary AI and machine learning platform, RADRÂ®, which utilizes over 200 billion oncology-focused data points to accelerate drug discovery and development. This AI-driven methodology has enabled the company to identify promising drug candidates more efficiently than traditional approaches. The planned pediatric trial represents an important application of artificial intelligence in addressing unmet medical needs in pediatric oncology.</p><p>The successful FDA meeting outcome demonstrates regulatory recognition of the potential for AI-discovered therapies to address challenging cancer types. For pediatric patients with CNS cancers and their families, this development offers hope for new treatment options that could improve survival rates and quality of life. The trial's design, incorporating both traditional efficacy endpoints and patient-centered outcomes, reflects a comprehensive approach to cancer drug development that considers both quantity and quality of life.</p>
