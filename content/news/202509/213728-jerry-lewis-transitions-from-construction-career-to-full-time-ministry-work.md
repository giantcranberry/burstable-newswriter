<p>Jerry Lewis, a Shelby County native, has transitioned from a successful construction career to full-time ministry work, demonstrating how practical skills can serve spiritual purposes. After more than two decades leading construction projects across Texas, Lewis grew his company into a thriving multi-million-dollar operation before stepping away to pursue what he describes as full-time ministry in everyday life.</p><p>Lewis believes that ministry doesn't start at 11 a.m. on Sunday but begins in the parking lot, the jobsite, or the kitchen table. His philosophy centers on the idea that wherever people are, that's where God shows up. This approach has taken him across borders, from helping missionaries build facilities in Mexico to advising community projects in Ghana.</p><p>Currently, Lewis is consulting with a congregation threatened with the loss of its property to a Texas Department of Transportation project. Offering his guidance pro bono, he serves as their advocate, helping them navigate ongoing negotiations to secure fair compensation and preserve their ability to continue operating. His ability to blend the practical with the spiritual has made him a trusted guide for congregations navigating both construction and crisis situations.</p><p>Friends and acquaintances recount numerous stories of Lewis stopping to help strangers in need, giving to those without resources, mentoring young men through health challenges, and showing up for families during times of tragedy. His work extends beyond professional consulting to personal mentorship and community support.</p><p>At home, Lewis maintains the same intentional approach as a devoted father of three, often reminding his children that family stability is part of a person's witness. He emphasizes that family will always come first, demonstrating how personal principles shape both his work and home life.</p><p>Throughout his various roles as builder, mentor, and minister, Lewis has kept one mission at the center: to serve faithfully, encourage others, and remind people that God is near. His message consistently returns to the fundamental principle that one must love God and love people, making his testimony about a life lived for others and for the glory of God.</p>
