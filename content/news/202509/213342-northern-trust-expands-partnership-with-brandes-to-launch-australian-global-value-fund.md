<p>Northern Trust has expanded its fund services relationship with Brandes Investment Partners to support the launch of the Brandes Global Value Fund in Australia, providing global custody and fund administration servicing for the new Australian Unit Trust. This development represents the latest evolution in a partnership that began in 1992 and has grown to encompass comprehensive financial services across multiple markets.</p><p>The expansion enables Brandes Investment Partners (Asia) Pte Ltd, part of the Brandes group of companies, to offer its value investing expertise to Australian institutional and wholesale investors through the newly launched fund. Brandes, a California-based investment advisory firm founded in 1974, specializes in managing global equity and fixed-income assets with a commitment to value investing principles that have guided the firm for nearly five decades.</p><p>Ryan Burns, Head of Global Fund Services, Americas at Northern Trust, emphasized that this expansion reflects the strength of the longstanding relationship and Northern Trust's ability to support Brandes' evolving global strategy. The partnership previously included the integration of seven U.S. mutual funds into the Northern Trust Datum One Series Trust in 2024, demonstrating the depth of their collaborative efforts.</p><p>Oliver Murray, Brandes CEO, highlighted the trust and value placed in the three-decade relationship with Northern Trust, noting the provider's scale, operational excellence, and high service standards. The collaboration has allowed Brandes to streamline its U.S. Mutual Fund business and efficiently enter the Australian market with its first domestically domiciled mutual fund, representing a strategic expansion into the APAC region.</p><p>Northern Trust's <a href="https://www.northerntrust.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Global Fund Services</a> provides a complete suite of asset servicing solutions, supporting complex investment strategies across all asset classes. The expansion into Australian fund services demonstrates the growing international demand for value investing strategies and the infrastructure required to support global investment distribution efforts.</p><p>This partnership expansion underscores the importance of established financial service providers in enabling investment firms to enter new markets with confidence, providing the operational backbone necessary for successful fund launches and ongoing management. The development highlights the continued globalization of investment opportunities and the critical role that custody and administration services play in facilitating cross-border investment strategies, particularly as value investing approaches gain traction in emerging markets.</p>
