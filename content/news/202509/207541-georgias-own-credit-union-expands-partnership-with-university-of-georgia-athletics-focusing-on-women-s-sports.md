<p>Georgia’s Own Credit Union, Georgia's third-largest credit union, has significantly expanded its partnership with University of Georgia Athletics with a new emphasis on women's sports programs. The landmark agreement includes the first-ever corporate on-field logo placement at any UGA facility, featuring the Georgia’s Own Credit Union logo painted on the softball field at Jack Turner Softball Stadium.</p><p>Dave Preter, president and CEO of Georgia’s Own Credit Union, stated that the investment reflects the growing national interest in women's athletics. As we've seen through Caitlin Clark storming the WNBA and ESPN partnering with Athletes Unlimited Softball League, women's athletics are driving fan interest nationwide at never-before-seen levels, Preter said. Both of those leagues rely on stars forged at the collegiate level, so we are thrilled to be making a sizable investment in one of the best women's college athletics programs in the nation.</p><p>The expanded partnership makes Georgia’s Own the presenting sponsor of the 2026 UGA softball team, which drew a record 56,921 fans to Jack Turner Softball Stadium in 2025 and nearly reached the Women's College World Series. Head Coach Tony Baldwin emphasized the significance of the investment, particularly the program-wide Name, Image, and Likeness (NIL) deal for student-athletes. What Georgia's Own Credit Union has done here is tremendous for our program, Baldwin said. The investment Georgia's Own is making in our team through a program-wide NIL deal not only provides life-changing opportunities for our student-athletes, but it also validates the hard work, commitment, and excellence they bring to this University every day.</p><p>J. Reid Parker Director of Athletics Josh Brooks called the partnership a significant moment for Georgia Athletics that sends a powerful message about the value, visibility, and growth of our female student-athletes and programs. Beyond softball, Georgia's Own will increase its visibility at gymnastics meets and women's basketball games, with additional digital signage appearances at Stegeman Coliseum, while maintaining its presence at football and men's basketball games. The credit union has partnered with UGA Athletics for over a decade, with this expansion representing a historic commitment to women's sports programming and athlete support.</p>
