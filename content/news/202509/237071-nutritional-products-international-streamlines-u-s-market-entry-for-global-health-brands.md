<p>For more than three decades, Mitch Gould has guided international health and wellness brands into one of the world's most competitive arenas: the U.S. retail market. As founder and CEO of Nutritional Products International (NPI), Gould continues to refine his signature Evolution of Distribution model, a turnkey platform that gives global manufacturers a cost-effective, streamlined pathway to American consumers. Every year, I see companies with fantastic products that struggle when they try to launch in the U.S., said Gould. They often approach this market as if it were just another extension of their home country. The reality is the U.S. has its own consumer mindset, regulatory landscape, and retail culture. That's why NPI exists—to provide brands with a roadmap.</p><p>Gould's Evolution of Distribution consolidates the critical components of a successful market entry under one roof. The platform includes regulatory expertise through an FDA-experienced food scientist who guides brands through compliance challenges. Logistics professionals manage shipping, customs, and warehousing, ensuring products reach the U.S. market without delays. With decades of relationships across the retail spectrum, NPI's sales team connects brands with the country's largest and most influential retailers. Through its sister company, InHealth Media, NPI offers specialized health and wellness marketing campaigns that deliver both consumer awareness and retailer buy-in.</p><p>Gould's career has taken him inside the national headquarters of nearly every major U.S. retailer—including Walmart, Costco, Target, CVS, Walgreens, Rite Aid, Home Depot, Lowe's, Sam's Club, Kmart, and 7-Eleven. He also played a pivotal role in helping launch Amazon's health and wellness category in the early 2000s, securing placement for more than 150 brands during the category's formative years. Speed to market and cost-effectiveness are what international brands need most, Gould said. That's what the Evolution of Distribution delivers. It's a one-stop solution built on decades of real-world experience.</p><p>The implications for international health and wellness brands are significant, as the U.S. market represents one of the largest consumer bases globally but also one of the most challenging to penetrate successfully. For business leaders in the health and wellness sector, NPI's model addresses critical barriers that often derail international expansion efforts, including regulatory compliance, supply chain logistics, and retailer relationships. The platform's comprehensive approach could accelerate global innovation reaching American consumers while reducing the financial risks typically associated with international market entry.</p><p>Nutritional Products International (NPI), founded by retail distribution expert Mitch Gould, specializes in launching and expanding product sales in the U.S. Through its proprietary Evolution of Distribution platform, NPI provides international and domestic manufacturers with a cost-effective, turnkey solution for FDA compliance, logistics, sales, and marketing.
