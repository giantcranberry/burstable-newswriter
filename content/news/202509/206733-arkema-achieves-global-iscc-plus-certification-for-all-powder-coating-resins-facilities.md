<p>Arkema has achieved ISCC PLUS certification for its polyester powder coating resins facility in North Kansas City, Missouri, marking the completion of the company's global certification roadmap that now encompasses all powder resin plants worldwide. This strategic milestone ensures that facilities in North Kansas City, Saint Celoni, Spain, and Navi Mumbai, India are all certified under Arkema's mass balance powder resins offering, providing consistent sustainable solutions across major regions.</p><p>The certification enables customers across various industries to advance more sustainable coating solutions for markets including consumer products, domestic appliances, electronics, automotive, architectural metal finishes, e-mobility, and metal furniture. Linda Armitage, Business Manager for Powder Coating Resins at Arkema, emphasized that the company has prioritized attaining ISCC+ certification at all powder resin plants globally over recent years, reflecting a long-term commitment to reducing the product carbon footprint in coatings and related industries.</p><p>Powder coating resins provide solvent-free, low-waste, and highly durable solutions, positioning them as key enablers of sustainable innovation for customers, suppliers, end users, and partners. The durability refers to the finished coating's performance after application, ensuring long-lasting protection while minimizing environmental impact. These certifications are part of a larger mass balance and certification roadmap covering multiple technologies and products for coatings and related applications.</p><p>The comprehensive approach includes a complete range of bio-attributed specialty resins and additives, encompassing high solids, waterborne, UV-LED-EB, and polyester powder materials. Bio-attributed content indicates that biobased or recycled feedstock has been ascribed using mass-balance methodology, with percentage breakdown based on ISCC+ methodology calculations. The mass balance traceability chain method tracks material flow through production systems and attributes production process inputs to outputs through certified bookkeeping.</p><p>This distinct accounting method verifies that certified feedstock has replaced equivalent quantities of fossil raw materials at the supply chain's beginning and can be attributed to products for sale, ensuring balanced input and output.
