<p>Thompson Thrift will develop Autry at Tulip Grove, a luxury 300-unit community in the Atlanta suburb of Buford, with the first residents expected in January 2027. The development targets Gwinnett County's dynamic growth market, where managing partner Josh Purvis noted the area features a thriving population, strong economy and exceptional employment rates.</p><p>The 10-acre community at 1325 Laurel Crossing Pkwy NE will feature four-story, elevator-serviced buildings with one-, two-, and three-bedroom apartment homes. Premium interior finishes include quartz countertops, stainless-steel appliances, hardwood-style flooring, and designer fixtures. Additional residential features encompass large walk-in closets, walk-in showers, patio and balcony options, detached garages, full-size washers and dryers, high-speed internet access, and an Amazon package hub.</p><p>Resort-style amenities will include two fully equipped fitness centers with 24-hour access, a heated swimming pool, electric vehicle charging stations, courtyards, an outdoor pavilion with gas fireplace, community grilling areas, outdoor game area, golf simulator, dog park, pet spa with grooming stations, billiards and shuffleboard, and a 24-hour social hub. The community's adjacency to The Exchange, a 100-acre master planned development, provides residents access to retail, entertainment and restaurant options including Sprouts Farmers Market, Pickle and Social, Andretti Indoor Karting & Games and TopGolf.</p><p>The development's strategic positioning responds to significant demographic trends, with the three-mile radius population growing 31.9% over the last 15 years, outpacing both Gwinnett County and the Atlanta metropolitan area. Gwinnett County maintains a 97% workforce employment rate with average household income of $114,000. Nearby Interstate 85 offers connectivity to downtown Lawrenceville, downtown Atlanta, Mall of Georgia and Sugarloaf Mills.</p><p>Major area employers include Publix Distribution & Manufacturing, Primerica, and Northside Hospital, which is expanding with a 17-floor tower completion in 2026 generating 5,000 additional jobs. The nearby Rowen development, a 2,000-acre mixed-use project potentially creating 100,000 jobs, sits just 2.5 miles from the community. Thompson Thrift has invested more than $6 billion into local communities over nearly 40 years, with the Thompson Thrift 2025 Multifamily Development, LP providing equity capital for this project.
