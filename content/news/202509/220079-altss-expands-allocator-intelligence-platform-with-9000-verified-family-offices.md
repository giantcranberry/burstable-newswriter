<p>Altss has expanded its allocator intelligence platform to include 9,000 verified family offices, establishing what the company claims is the largest family-office database globally. The Miami-based platform serves general partners and investor-relations teams requiring current, decision-grade context on allocation patterns, timing, and motivations.</p><p>The expansion emphasizes evidence, recency, and provenance, with profiles refreshed frequently and enriched with open-source intelligence indicators that influence allocator behavior. These indicators include mandate shifts, new fund activity, team and board changes, and conference participation. Precision filtering capabilities enable research, due-diligence, and meeting-preparation workflows by strategy, stage, geography, structure, and commitment profile.</p><p>Scale only matters if it's current, said Dawid Siekiera, Founder of Altss. By pairing the largest verified family-office coverage with live LP signals and transparent sourcing, we help teams focus on the allocators most likely to be relevant today and in the weeks ahead as we expand to full LP coverage. The family-office intelligence spans North America, Europe, the Middle East, Asia-Pacific, and Latin America.</p><p>Near-term additions will extend to institutional LPs including pensions, insurers, endowments, sovereign funds, corporates, banks, and RIAs, with structured fields aligned to investor relations and diligence workflows. Key features of the expansion include 9,000-plus verified family offices mapped with practical fields for triage and preparation, live LP context through OSINT signals on mandates, team moves, new funds, and events to inform timing and prioritization, fast refresh cycles with change-triggered updates and traceable sources, and research-grade filters for allocator research and capital-formation planning.</p><p>Over the next few weeks, Altss will extend to full institutional LP coverage, with subsequent phases broadening the graph to startups and funds across venture, growth, and private equity. This approach combines the breadth of legacy market databases with relationship context and social-listening signals similar to Palantir's methodology. With this expansion, Altss positions itself as a decision-grade alternative to legacy market databases, favoring current data, transparent provenance, and a graph that reflects how capital actually moves in private markets.</p><p>Additional details are available on the <a href="https://www.altss.com/blog" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Altss blog</a> regarding the family-office coverage expansion, or learn more about the <a href="https://www.altss.com/platform" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">allocator intelligence platform Altss</a>.</p>
