<p>Esquire Deposition Solutions LLC has achieved ISO/IEC 27001:2022 certification for its information security management system, representing a significant advancement from its previous ISO 27001:2013 certification. This internationally recognized standard validates that the company's policies, processes, and controls meet the highest industry standards for managing risks related to client data security.</p><p>Chief Information Officer Jim Ballowe emphasized that this certification demonstrates Esquire's commitment to information security and data privacy leadership. The certification validates the company's modern approach to data security, which it deliberately invests in to protect the sensitive data that law firm and enterprise clients entrust to the organization. Additional information about Esquire's security program is available at <a href="https://www.esquiresolutions.com/solutions/security/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.esquiresolutions.com/solutions/security/</a>.</p><p>The ISO/IEC 27001:2022 certification supports Esquire's mission to preserve and protect the sanctity of the record to ensure equal access to justice for all. As part of its comprehensive security framework, the company has successfully completed multiple Association of International Certified Professional Accountants SOC 2 Type II audits, providing ongoing assurance that internal controls are well-designed and operating effectively.</p><p>Ballowe noted that achieving this certification is particularly challenging for smaller companies and that third-party litigation service providers have traditionally flown under the radar when addressing information security vulnerabilities. The company's investment in this upgraded standard further reduces the risk of unauthorized access, data breaches, and information leaks by implementing strict security controls throughout the entire court reporting process.</p><p>To obtain the certification, Esquire completed a rigorous, multi-stage audit covering security policies, data handling, and operational resilience. The ISO/IEC 27001:2022 standard mandates requirements for implementing, monitoring, maintaining, and continually improving information security management systems while prescribing best practices for documentation, responsibility divisions, availability, access control, and security measures.</p><p>The certification also assists organizations in complying with numerous regulatory and legal requirements related to information security, providing additional assurance to clients in the legal industry where data protection is paramount. Esquire Deposition Solutions supports more than 300,000 depositions annually for law firms, insurance companies, and corporate legal departments through its court reporting, video, translation, and transcription services.</p><p>This achievement sets a new benchmark for data security in the legal services industry, particularly for companies handling sensitive deposition materials. The certification provides clients with confidence that their confidential legal information receives the highest level of protection against evolving cyber threats and regulatory requirements.</p>
