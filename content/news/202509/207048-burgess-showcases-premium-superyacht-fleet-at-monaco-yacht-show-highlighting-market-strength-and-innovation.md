<p>Burgess, the global leader in luxury yachting, is showcasing a fleet of eight exceptional vessels at the Monaco Yacht Show, demonstrating the continued evolution of superyacht design and the robust market for high-value maritime assets. The lineup includes some of the show's most impressive yachts, with asking prices reaching €199 million for the 77.8-meter ENERGY, reflecting the premium valuation of cutting-edge yacht construction and amenities.</p><p>The 291.9-foot HERE COMES THE SUN, extensively rebuilt in 2021 with a new exterior and extended length, represents Northern European craftsmanship at its finest. This vessel combines timeless elegance with modern features including two helipads, a cinema, and a vast beach club and spa, accommodating up to 20 guests in 10 cabins. The yacht's <a href="https://www.burgessyachts.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">online listing</a> provides detailed specifications for serious buyers.</p><p>ENERGY, at 77.8 meters with 2,885GT of interior volume, defies expectations with its innovative design. An elevator connects all guest decks from the beach club to the bridge, while the sun deck features a touch-and-go helipad, showstopping bar, and jacuzzi. The dedicated owner's deck includes a foredeck jacuzzi and firepit, a bar lounge wrapped in sliding glass, dining for 18, and a dramatic pool centerpiece. Prospective buyers can view the complete details through its <a href="https://www.burgessyachts.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">online listing</a>.</p><p>The fleet also includes STELLA MI, the first in the sought-after Amels 200 series, delivered in 2021 with a full-beam owner's suite with balcony and beach club with sauna and steam shower. SCOTT FREE, an exemplary build from Abeking & Rasmussen, combines timeless exterior lines with a bold, personality-filled interior by Bannenberg & Rowell, having undergone a major refit in 2022.</p><p>Newer additions to the showcase include the 44.3-meter sailing yacht MAGIC, delivered by Vitters Shipyard in 2025, representing an exceptional opportunity for a discerning buyer to own a brand-new Dutch fast cruising sloop. The harmonious interiors blend warm tones with contrasting textures, focusing on seamless connection between indoor and outdoor spaces with expansive 360-degree views and retractable glass doors.</p><p>HEMISPHERE, one of the world's largest sailing catamarans at 44.2 meters, built in 2011 by Pendennis and refitted in 2023, demonstrates the growing interest in alternative yacht designs for off-the-beaten-track exploration. Her twin hulls provide exceptional stability, making her ideal for family cruising while maintaining luxury amenities including a jacuzzi, sunbathing trampoline forward, and al fresco dining areas.</p><p>The Burgess presentation at the Monaco Yacht Show, now in its 34th year, underscores the continuing strength of the superyacht market and the importance of this event for serious buyers and industry professionals. The company's stand at QH15, Quai de l'Hirondelle features a design celebrating Burgess' 50th anniversary, highlighting the firm's longstanding leadership in the superyacht industry.</p>
