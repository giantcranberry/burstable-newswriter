<p>Mission North, a communications agency serving consequential companies, has launched a public affairs practice to assist clients in navigating the increasingly complex regulatory landscape at federal, state, and local levels. The new offering expands the firm's corporate affairs practice, which is on pace to grow more than threefold this year due to accelerating demand for integrated services.</p><p>The practice addresses the critical need for agile, creative, and integrated communications as artificial intelligence accelerates organizational change and reshapes stakeholder requirements for both startups and Fortune 50 companies. Organizations now face increased complexity and new pressures at all government levels, from the executive branch to local entities, making policy and stakeholder engagement a new competitive battlefield.</p><p>Led by Emily Field, who brings deep public sector and policy communications experience, the practice will focus on emerging technology issues including AI safety, data center energy consumption, and defense technology. Field, previously at RH Strategic in Washington, D.C., will lead efforts to educate government entities and constituents to drive technology adoption and build thought leadership for clients.</p><p>Bill Bourdon, co-CEO at Mission North, emphasized that splitting communications across multiple specialty shops creates friction, and the agency aims to offer deep expertise combined with the breadth of specialized services of a larger firm. Since January, the regulatory landscape has fundamentally changed, requiring innovative approaches to reach key stakeholders amidst evolving government methods.</p><p>The public affairs offering includes comprehensive strategic services such as reputation management advisory, targeted whisper campaigns, policy content development, stakeholder engagement, legislative analysis, congressional testimony, and strategic alignment. These services help clients address reputational challenges and leverage storytelling opportunities amid shifting policies.

The launch signals how communications firms are adapting to serve technology companies that must now navigate complex government relations alongside traditional marketing and public relations challenges.</p>
