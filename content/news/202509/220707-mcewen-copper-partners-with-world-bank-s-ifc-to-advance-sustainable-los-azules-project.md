<p>McEwen Copper Inc., a subsidiary of McEwen Inc., has entered a strategic collaboration agreement with the International Finance Corporation, a World Bank Group member, to align the Los Azules copper project in Argentina with international environmental, social, and governance standards. This partnership establishes a framework for potential future debt and equity financing as part of McEwen Copper's comprehensive development strategy for one of the world's largest undeveloped copper deposits.</p><p>The Los Azules project has already secured Environmental Impact Declaration approval and expects to complete its feasibility study by October 2025, positioning the operation to begin construction following final engineering and financing arrangements. The project aims to implement sustainable mining practices that emphasize transparency, reduced carbon emissions, and meaningful community benefits. McEwen Copper maintains a 46.4% stake in the venture, which targets becoming Argentina's first regenerative copper mine with carbon neutrality by 2038.</p><p>A June 2023 Preliminary Economic Assessment reveals substantial economic potential, estimating a $2.7 billion after-tax net present value at $3.75 per pound copper price. The assessment projects a 27-year mine life with copper resources of 10.9 billion pounds at 0.40% copper indicated plus 26.7 billion pounds at 0.31% copper inferred. For detailed PEA information, investors can review <a href="https://ibn.fm/MUX" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">McEwen's press release</a>.</p><p>The IFC collaboration represents a critical milestone in securing the project's financial viability while ensuring adherence to internationally recognized environmental and social standards. This partnership emerges during a period of escalating global copper demand, particularly driven by renewable energy technologies and electric vehicle infrastructure requirements. The alignment with IFC standards positions Los Azules favorably for international financing and demonstrates McEwen's commitment to responsible resource development methodologies.</p><p>McEwen Inc., as an established gold and silver producer with operations across Nevada, Canada, Mexico, and Argentina, brings extensive mining expertise to the Los Azules development. The company maintains its corporate communications through its <a href="https://ibn.fm/MUX" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">newsroom platform</a> for ongoing project updates and corporate developments. This announcement coincides with increasing global attention on sustainable mining practices and copper's essential role in transitioning to cleaner energy systems worldwide.</p><p>The timing of this partnership reflects broader industry trends where major financial institutions are increasingly prioritizing ESG-compliant projects. For business and technology leaders, the Los Azules development represents both an investment opportunity and a case study in how major resource projects can align financial objectives with environmental and social responsibility. The project's emphasis on carbon neutrality and regenerative practices sets new benchmarks for the mining sector while addressing critical supply chain needs for copper-intensive technologies driving the global energy transition.</p>
