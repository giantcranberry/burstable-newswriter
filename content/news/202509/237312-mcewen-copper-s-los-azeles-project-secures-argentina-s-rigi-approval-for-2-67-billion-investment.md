<p>McEwen Inc. has received approval for its Los Azeles copper project to participate in Argentina's Large Investment Incentive Regime, as confirmed by Minister of Economy Luis Caputo. The designation formalizes a US$2.672 billion investment plan covering exploration, construction, and operations, marking a historic development for the San Juan Province initiative that will become Argentina's first producer of high-purity copper cathodes.</p><p>The RIGI approval validates both the technical and financial strength of Los Azeles and its sustainability framework, which emphasizes renewable energy utilization, minimal water consumption, and long-term contributions to local development. According to project projections, the operation is expected to generate over US$30 billion in export revenues while creating substantial employment opportunities and boosting provincial and national tax revenues. Michael Meding, Vice President of McEwen Copper and General Manager of the Los Azeles Project, stated that this approval reinforces McEwen Copper's long-term commitment to Argentina and the Province of San Juan.</p><p>McEwen Inc. maintains a 46.4% stake in McEwen Copper, the developer of the advanced-stage Los Azeles copper project that aims to become Argentina's first regenerative copper mine targeting carbon neutrality by 2038. A June 2023 Preliminary Economic Assessment estimated the project's after-tax net present value at $2.7 billion using $3.75 per pound copper pricing, with a 27-year mine life and substantial copper resources. Investors can review detailed PEA information in <a href="https://ibn.fm/MUX" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">McEwen's press release</a> available through the company's newsroom.</p><p>The company's shares trade publicly on both the New York Stock Exchange and Toronto Stock Exchange under the symbol MUX. This development represents a significant milestone for Argentina's mining sector and positions the country to capitalize on growing global copper demand driven by electrification and renewable energy transitions. The project's emphasis on sustainable practices and carbon neutrality aligns with increasing investor and regulatory focus on environmental, social, and governance criteria in mining operations worldwide.</p>
