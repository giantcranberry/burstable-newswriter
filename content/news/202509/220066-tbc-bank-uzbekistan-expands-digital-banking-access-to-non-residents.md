<p>TBC Bank Uzbekistan, the country's leading digital bank, has expanded access to its financial services to non-residents living in or visiting Uzbekistan. Foreign nationals can now access TBC UZ's digital banking products including the flagship Salom Debit Card, deposits, transfers, and utility payments through the <a href="https://tbcuz.app" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">TBC UZ app</a>, offering the same digital experience as existing customers.</p><p>The expansion represents a strategic move by Central Asia's leading digital banking ecosystem to broaden its product offering and tap new customer segments. With TBC Uzbekistan already reaching 21 million unique registered users—more than 50% of Uzbekistan's population—this initiative significantly widens the bank's potential customer base while creating new opportunities for financial integration of highly-skilled expatriate workers, students, and entrepreneurs.</p><p>Nika Kurdiani, CEO of TBC Uzbekistan, emphasized that this move represents more than just a product launch. "We're opening a new gateway to Uzbekistan's financial system for people who come here to study, work, or build a business," Kurdiani stated. "We've already set new standards for retail and business banking, and now we're taking the next step: integrating non-residents into our digital ecosystem while delivering the same convenience, speed, and security that our existing customers enjoy."</p><p>The registration process for new non-resident customers is conducted remotely through the TBC UZ app, requiring an international passport, proof of temporary registration in Uzbekistan, personal identification number, and local phone number. Following online application and identity verification, a TBC representative meets with the customer to sign the agreement and complete onboarding. Currently, these meetings are available only in Tashkent, with nationwide expansion planned before year-end.</p><p>TBC Uzbekistan's digital ecosystem extends beyond banking services to include Payme, a digital payments app for individuals and small businesses available at <a href="https://payme.uz" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">payme.uz</a>, TBC Nasiya for installment credit, and TBC Insurance. The company achieved profitability just two years after launch—a record among global digital banks—and reported operating income of $62 million in the second quarter of 2025, with loan and deposit books growing 105% and 86% year-over-year respectively.</p><p>This expansion enables TBC Uzbekistan to tap into a sustainable new customer segment while boosting customer loyalty and engagement. The move supports the growth of Uzbekistan's digital economy by providing foreign nationals with access to modern financial services, reflecting the country's increasing integration into global economic networks and its appeal to international talent and investment.</p>
