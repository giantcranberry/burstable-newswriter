<p>Tactical Resources, a mineral exploration company focused on U.S.-made rare earth elements, is advancing its flagship Peak Project in Texas to strengthen American supply chain sovereignty for materials essential to semiconductors, electric vehicles, advanced robotics, and national defense. Under CEO Ranjeet Sundher's leadership, the company has secured exclusive rights to rare earth materials at the operational Sierra Blanca Quarry mine, positioning itself as a key player in reducing reliance on Chinese-dominated supply chains.</p><p>The Peak Project's uniqueness lies in its status as one of the few rare earth hard rock direct-leach-extractable projects globally, located southeast of El Paso with existing permitting and infrastructure. Sundher explained that the direct-leach process allows bypassing extra processing steps, enhancing go-to-market speed and cost efficiency. The project benefits from highway and rail access, reducing development costs compared to greenfield operations, and utilizes existing stockpiled byproduct material from quarry operations, providing a head start for rare earth extraction.</p><p>Recent milestones include a strategic agreement with Sierra Blanca Quarry and a business combination agreement with Plum Acquisition Corp. III to pursue a Nasdaq listing, which Sundher described as transformative for accessing capital and accelerating growth. The company's strategy focuses on American assets for domestic production, targeting advanced projects with clean processing capabilities, all embodied by the Peak Project.</p><p>Rare earth elements are indispensable for technologies like smartphones, EVs, AI, and defense systems due to their unique electromagnetic properties. Chinese control over supply chains creates vulnerabilities for Western interests, driving U.S. government support through public-private partnerships and funding. Sundher emphasized that limited processing capacity outside China and competitive pricing challenges are immediate hurdles, but strategic support can build a robust domestic supply chain.</p><p>Looking ahead, Tactical Resources plans to complete its Nasdaq listing, conduct pilot testing and flowsheet optimization, and ultimately construct a rare earth extraction facility at the Peak Project. The company believes its go-to-market plan and differentiated asset position it to capitalize on growing demand for secure, domestic rare earth production.</p>
