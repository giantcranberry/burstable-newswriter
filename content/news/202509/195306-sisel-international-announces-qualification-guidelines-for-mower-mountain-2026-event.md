<p>Sisel International has released the official qualification guidelines for its Mower Mountain 2026 event, creating a competitive framework that rewards high-performing distributors with substantial benefits and exclusive experiences. The qualification period runs from August 1, 2025, to May 1, 2026, during which distributors must achieve two or more rank increases within the Star or Diamond Class to be considered for the top 20 spots.</p><p>In cases where more than 20 distributors meet the rank increase requirement, the Total Downline Volume Percentage increase during the qualification period will serve as the tiebreaker. Winners must additionally maintain their highest rank for at least three consecutive months to ensure eligibility. This structured approach ensures that recognition goes to distributors who demonstrate sustained performance excellence rather than temporary achievements.</p><p>Qualified winners will receive comprehensive rewards including two event tickets valued at $700, travel reimbursement up to $1,000 USD, and a four-night stay at the <a href="https://www.marriott.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Marriott Hotel</a> in Provo, Utah valued at $800. The first distributor achieving three rank increases during the qualification period will receive an additional bonus upgrade to the Marriott Presidential Suite, valued at $1,600.</p><p>Beyond the main competition, distributors can qualify for the Mower Family Elite Dinner Experience by purchasing a Mower Mountain ticket and achieving 10,000+ Personal Sales Volume between their ticket purchase date and May 1, 2026. The top 50 accounts meeting this threshold will receive invitations for themselves and a guest to attend an exclusive dinner with the Mower family, Sisel executives, and a special guest speaker, creating unique networking and mentorship opportunities.</p><p>All participants must maintain active distributor status in good standing throughout the qualification period, and all rewards are non-transferable according to company policies. Travel arrangements and prize details are subject to specific terms and conditions that ensure fair implementation of the program. Winners for both the main competition and Elite Dinner Experience will be announced on May 4, 2026, during the company's corporate call, adding transparency to the selection process.</p><p>The Mower Mountain 2026 event continues Sisel International's tradition of celebrating distributor achievement while fostering professional development and community building within its network. This approach reinforces the company's commitment to supporting distributor success through meaningful incentives and recognition programs that encourage both personal growth and business development.</p>
