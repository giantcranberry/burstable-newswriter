<p>Global demand for critical minerals is rising sharply as electrification, renewable energy, and emerging technologies accelerate. Copper has become central to this transition, with demand projected to outpace supply for decades. Many producing mines are seeing grades decline, while new projects often face long development timelines. As a result, high-grade resources in stable jurisdictions have become increasingly valuable for securing future supply chains.</p><p>Against this backdrop, Trilogy Metals is positioned as a key North American developer. The company, through its 50/50 joint venture with South32, controls the Upper Kobuk Mineral Projects in Alaska's Ambler Mining District, considered one of the richest undeveloped copper-dominant regions globally. The district hosts world-class polymetallic volcanogenic massive sulphide deposits that contain copper, zinc, lead, gold and silver, and carbonate replacement deposits, which have been found to host high-grade copper and cobalt mineralization.</p><p>Exploration efforts have been focused on two deposits in the Ambler Mining District â€“ the Arctic VMS deposit and the Bornite carbonate replacement deposit. Both deposits are located within a land package that spans approximately 190,929 hectares. On December 19, 2019, South32, a globally diversified mining and metals company, exercised its option to form a 50/50 joint venture with Trilogy. The latest news and updates relating to TMQ are available in the company's newsroom at <a href="https://ibn.fm/TMQ" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://ibn.fm/TMQ</a>.</p><p>Ambler Metals has an agreement with NANA Regional Corporation, Inc., an Alaska Native Corporation that provides a framework for the exploration and potential development of the Ambler Mining District in cooperation with local communities. Trilogy's vision is to develop the Ambler Mining District into a premier North American copper producer while protecting and respecting subsistence livelihoods. The company holds a 50% interest in Ambler Metals LLC, which has a 100% interest in the Upper Kobuk Mineral Projects in northwestern Alaska. The full article discussing the company's advancement of critical minerals can be viewed at <a href="https://ibn.fm/KX8U4" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://ibn.fm/KX8U4</a>.</p><p>The strategic importance of Trilogy Metals' position in Alaska's mineral-rich region comes at a time when North American critical mineral supply chains are gaining increased attention for economic and national security reasons. The Ambler Mining District's undeveloped resources represent significant potential for domestic production of minerals essential for clean energy technologies, electric vehicles, and infrastructure modernization. This development could help reduce reliance on foreign sources for materials critical to the energy transition and technological advancement.</p>
