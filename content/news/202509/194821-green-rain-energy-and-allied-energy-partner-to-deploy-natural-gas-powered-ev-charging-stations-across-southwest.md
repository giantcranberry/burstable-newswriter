<p>Green Rain Energy Holdings Inc. has entered into a Memorandum of Understanding with Allied Energy Corporation to provide BTU-validated natural gas from producing wells for electric vehicle charging infrastructure across Texas, New Mexico, and other Southwestern states. The partnership aims to deploy off-grid and hybrid EV charging stations using natural gas as a primary energy source, addressing growing concerns about electrical grid capacity limitations.</p><p>The collaboration comes at a critical time when electric vehicle adoption is rapidly increasing, creating strain on existing power infrastructure. By utilizing natural gas from producing wells, the companies can bypass lengthy utility interconnection processes that often delay charging station deployment by years. This approach enables modular and rapid infrastructure development along key transportation corridors where EV charging availability remains limited.</p><p>Alfredo Papadakis, President of Green Rain Energy, emphasized the strategic importance of the agreement, stating that it provides clean, flexible energy input for rapid EV infrastructure expansion without dependency on traditional utility interconnects. The partnership leverages Allied Energy's natural gas production capabilities combined with Green Rain's expertise in developing EV charging sites and solar farms nationwide.</p><p>The initiative represents a significant step toward addressing one of the major barriers to widespread EV adoption: charging infrastructure availability and reliability. By creating off-grid charging solutions powered by natural gas, the companies can deploy stations in remote locations and areas with limited electrical capacity.
