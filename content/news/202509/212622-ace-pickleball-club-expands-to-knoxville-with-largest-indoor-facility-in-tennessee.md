<p>Ace Pickleball Club will open a new location in Knoxville at 11130 Kingston Pike, Suite 6. The 47,000-square-foot facility will feature 15 competition-sized courts and one dinking court, making it the largest climate-controlled indoor pickleball club in Tennessee. The club is expected to create 10 new jobs in the local community.</p><p>The Knoxville location will be operated by Don Jacobson III, a fourth-generation spring manufacturer and robotics teacher who discovered pickleball through his lifelong enthusiasm for racquet sports. Jacobson was inspired to open the club after visiting Ace Pickleball Club's Roswell location as a player and speaking with members about the welcoming atmosphere and ease of meeting new people.</p><p>As a robotics teacher, Jacobson's passion for teaching aligns with Ace Pickleball Club's motto: "Start now, play forever." His vision for the Knoxville location emphasizes creating a space where families and friends can unplug, get active, and connect through one of America's fastest-growing sports. "Bringing Ace Pickleball to Knoxville is about more than just opening a club," Jacobson said. "It is about creating a space where families like mine can connect, grow, and enjoy a healthy, active lifestyle together."</p><p>The club will offer a simplified membership model with a single monthly payment, similar to a traditional gym membership, providing unlimited open play without reservation requirements or additional fees. Members will have access to professional-grade cushioned courts, clinics, club-coordinated tournaments, social events, and court reservations. Unlimited paddle demos will be included, allowing members to test equipment from various brands.</p><p>For newcomers to the sport, Ace Pickleball Club will offer free introductory clinics to teach rules and build confidence. The club will also provide a free first month of membership leading up to its grand opening, with interested individuals encouraged to sign up for the email list for notification when this offer launches. More information about the Knoxville location is available at <a href="https://www.acepickleballclub.com/knoxville-tn" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.acepickleballclub.com/knoxville-tn</a>.</p><p>With 16 locations already open nationwide and more planned for 2025, Ace Pickleball Club continues to expand its unique open play model that eliminates the need for players to coordinate with others or plan in advance. The franchise prioritizes member experience through state-of-the-art facilities and inclusive pricing, catering to all skill levels from competitive players seeking calorie-burning matches to those looking for lighthearted games with friends.</p>
