<p>The Supervisory Board of NFON AG has announced significant management changes effective October 1, 2025, with Andreas Wesselmann transitioning from Chief Technology Officer to Chairman of the Management Board and Alexander Beck joining as the new Chief Financial Officer. This leadership reorganization comes as previous CEO and CFO Patrik Heider requested early contract termination to pursue new professional challenges.</p><p>Wesselmann's appointment as CEO represents a strategic consolidation of leadership responsibilities, combining oversight of the company's strategic direction with responsibility for sales and marketing functions. This integration of product, technology, and market responsibilities is designed to align innovations more closely with customer needs and accelerate scaling efforts. The company demonstrated long-term commitment to Wesselmann's leadership vision by extending his contract early by five years until 2030.</p><p>Alexander Beck brings substantial financial expertise to NFON's leadership team, with extensive experience as CFO and managing director across multiple sectors including retail at MediaMarktSaturn, software at Nemetschek, and most recently in the bicycle industry at Accell Group. As CFO, Beck will be responsible for the company's financial strategy and will work closely with Wesselmann to advance NFON's development and growth initiatives.</p><p>Rainer Koppitz, Chairman of the Supervisory Board, emphasized the strategic importance of this reorganization, stating that it lays the foundation for NFON's next growth phase. The leadership change occurs as NFON continues to implement its <a href="https://www.nfon.com/en/corporate/company/strategy" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">NFON Next 2027 corporate strategy</a>, focusing on establishing the company as the leading European provider of AI-based business communications.</p><p>Wesselmann expressed confidence in the new leadership structure, anticipating close collaboration with Beck to expand innovative capabilities and tap new market opportunities. The management changes reflect NFON's commitment to combining technological innovation with operational excellence, particularly in AI-based applications serving approximately 55,000 business customers across Europe. The company operates as a licensed telecoms provider in 15 European countries and maintains its cloud services in certified German data centers powered entirely by renewable energy sources.</p>
