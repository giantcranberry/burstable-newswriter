<p>Optime has introduced Video2Market, a platform that fundamentally changes how vendors and partners approach demand generation through interactive video technology. The system compresses the entire partner marketing experience into a single, AI-powered link, delivering 77% engagement rates and real-time leads directly to partner representatives' inboxes. This represents a significant shift from traditional channel marketing approaches that have struggled with engagement and measurable results.</p><p>The platform extends beyond traditional channel marketing automation, evolving into what the company calls Partner Demand Automation. Unlike legacy systems that rely on static campaign syndication, V2M incorporates AI-driven personalization, multi-layer interactive video campaigns, and smart incentives packaged into a single powerful link available at <a href="https://ai-optime.com/en/video2market-ai-landing" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://ai-optime.com/en/video2market-ai-landing</a>. This integration of multiple marketing functions into a unified system addresses longstanding inefficiencies in partner channel management.</p><p>Maria Martin, CEO and Founder of Optime, explained that partner marketing has long been stuck in static campaign portals, while V2M flips that model by giving sales representatives a voice, reward, and real reason to share content. The platform enables vendor and partner representatives to share their own unique, personalized video links across multiple channels including social media, direct mail, and WhatsApp while receiving real-time leads directly in their inbox. This approach transforms sales representatives from passive distributors to active, engaged participants in the marketing process.</p><p>Claudio Ayub, Chief Revenue Officer at Optime, described V2M as a game-changer for the company and its customers, driving unparalleled innovation across the industry. The platform provides actionable insights such as demand sensing and buying group engagement, which drives higher adoption, accelerated growth, and stronger business relationships between vendors and their channel partners. These capabilities represent a fundamental advancement in how businesses can measure and optimize their partner ecosystem performance.</p><p>Key differentiators of the V2M platform include built-in channel incentives such as SPIFFs, points, and passthrough MDF, along with AI personalization for industry verticals, buyer personas, tone, and language customization. The system has been piloted in production with thousands of channel partners worldwide and is now available to current Optime customers within their familiar Video2Market environment. This extensive testing phase ensures the platform's reliability and effectiveness across diverse market conditions.</p><p>For business leaders, the implications of this technology are substantial. The 77% engagement rate dramatically outperforms traditional email marketing campaigns, which typically achieve single-digit engagement rates. The real-time lead delivery system eliminates delays in sales follow-up, potentially increasing conversion rates and shortening sales cycles. The platform's ability to provide detailed insights into buying group engagement offers unprecedented visibility into the customer journey through partner channels.</p><p>The industry impact extends beyond immediate sales improvements. By integrating incentives directly into the platform, V2M addresses one of the most persistent challenges in channel management: motivating partner sales teams to actively promote vendor solutions. The AI personalization capabilities enable scaling of customized messaging across large partner networks, something previously only achievable with significant manual effort and resources.</p><p>Optime will host a live webinar on October 14th, 2025, titled "It's Not Just TCMA Anymore, It's Partner Demand Automation in a Link" to showcase the V2M platform in action. The company has made demonstration requests available through their contact form at <a href="https://ai-optime.com/en/#contact-form" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://ai-optime.com/en/#contact-form</a>. All release upgrades for the platform are detailed in the Optime Release Notes, providing transparency about the system's ongoing development and feature enhancements.</p>
