<p>Heights Wellness Retreat, formerly Massage Heights, has secured a multi-unit franchise agreement in Dallas led by local entrepreneurs Russell and Norelia Rogers, marking the brand's first entry into the Texas market since its October 2024 rebranding. The expansion represents a strategic move into one of the nation's largest metropolitan areas, bringing the company's enhanced wellness services beyond traditional massage and facials to include cutting-edge therapeutic offerings.</p><p>The Rogers will develop two locations in Dallas, with the first Retreat scheduled to open at 3111 Olympus Blvd, Suite 200 in Coppell, part of the new development The Sound at Cypress Waters. A second location is currently in site selection, indicating the company's commitment to establishing multiple access points for wellness services throughout the Dallas-Fort Worth area. This multi-unit approach demonstrates confidence in market demand and the scalability of the wellness concept.</p><p>Russell Rogers, a U.S. Air Force veteran with an MBA from Texas Christian University, and Norelia Rogers, a registered nurse specializing in dialysis, bring diverse professional backgrounds to their franchising venture. Their transition from real estate investments to wellness franchising post-COVID reflects broader entrepreneurial trends toward health and wellness businesses following the pandemic's heightened focus on well-being.</p><p>Heights Wellness Retreat enhances its core massage and facial services with innovative wellness technologies including cryotherapy, lymphatic drainage suits, meditation programs, red light therapy, infrared sauna, and halo salt therapy. These comprehensive offerings aim to provide holistic wellness experiences that address both physical and mental health needs, aligning with evolving consumer preferences for integrated self-care solutions that nurture body, mind, and spirit simultaneously.</p><p>Shane Evans, Founder and CEO of Heights Wellness Retreat, emphasized the strategic importance of this expansion, noting the alignment between the Rogers' entrepreneurial vision and the company's growth objectives. The global wellness industry is projected to reach <a href="https://www.massageheightsfranchise.com/heights-wellness-retreat/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">$9 trillion by 2028</a>, creating substantial opportunities for brands offering innovative wellness solutions. This market growth positions Heights Wellness Retreat for continued national expansion as consumer demand for accessible, comprehensive wellness services continues to accelerate.</p><p>The Dallas expansion reflects broader industry trends where consumers increasingly seek innovative, accessible wellness services that support holistic health beyond traditional spa treatments. This development not only creates new business opportunities but also addresses the growing emphasis on mental and physical well-being in urban communities, potentially influencing how wellness services are delivered and consumed in major metropolitan markets nationwide.</p>
