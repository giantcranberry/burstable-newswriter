<p>MobileX announced the upcoming launch of its Gold Network, a priority access service that provides customers with new controls over their mobile experience through on-demand or monthly priority high-speed network access. The service, available beginning October 18, is designed to deliver faster speeds and lower latency during network congestion in busy areas, addressing a common frustration for mobile users in crowded environments.</p><p>The Gold Network offers multiple access options tailored to different usage patterns. Customers can choose Gold On Demand for one-time high-speed boosts at events like concerts or sporting venues, paying $2.10 per GB for priority access while regular high-speed data decreases to $1.90 per GB. For continuous priority access, Gold Unlimited plans provide 10GB for $19.88 monthly or 30GB for $29.88 monthly. The Gold Build Your Own option allows customized plans starting at $4.08 monthly for priority access, with regular high-speed data plans beginning at $3.88 monthly.</p><p>Peter Adderton, founder and CEO of MobileX, emphasized the consumer choice aspect of the new service. For too long, carriers have dictated how customers access performance on their networks, Adderton stated. With the Gold Network, we are putting that choice back in the customer's hands. They can instantly upgrade to priority access when they want it, or simply rely on our regular high-speed data for all other times.</p><p>The higher priority access helps connections perform better during peak network congestion, delivering smoother streaming, more reliable video chat, and a more responsive mobile experience overall. While most customers don't require priority data consistently, MobileX recognizes that many experience network congestion in their daily routines and has designed the Gold Network to provide flexibility and customizable options on what the company describes as one of America's fastest 5G networks.</p><p>The MobileX Gold Network will be available through the MobileX app in XtraOptions. New customers can access the service by downloading the MobileX app from the <a href="https://apps.apple.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Apple App Store</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Google Play</a>, or by purchasing a MobileX SIM starter pack at more than 3,700 Walmart stores and on <a href="https://www.walmart.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Walmart.com</a>.
