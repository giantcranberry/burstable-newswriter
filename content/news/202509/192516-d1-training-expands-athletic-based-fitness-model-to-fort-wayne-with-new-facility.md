<p>D1 Training has opened a new fitness facility in Fort Wayne at 9307 Illinois Road, introducing athletic-based training principles to the local community. The concept utilizes sports-science backed regimens led by certified trainers to help individuals of all ages achieve their sport and fitness goals, marking a significant addition to the area's fitness landscape.</p><p>The facility is operated by local owner Matt Dressler, a former collegiate basketball player at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, who brings over 20 years of coaching experience to the venture. Dressler has maintained his passion for athletics while pursuing a successful engineering career and most recently served as assistant boys' basketball coach at Canterbury High School, where he helped lead the team to a State Championship in 2024.</p><p>Dressler emphasized the community-building aspect of the training approach, stating that his best college memories came from being part of a team that worked hard, overcame challenges, and grew stronger together. He sees D1 Training as not just about individual goals but about building a community where athletes and coaches support each other and grow together.</p><p>The training facility offers four distinct age-based programs: Rookie for ages 7-11, Developmental for ages 12-14, Prep for ages 15-18, and D1 Adult. Each program is structured around five athletic-based tenets: dynamic warm-up, performance, strength program, core and conditioning, and cool down. The facility provides group, semi-private, and one-on-one training options with certified coaches.</p><p>Dressler joins a roster of franchisees that includes professional athletes and is part of a network founded in 2001 by former NFL player Will Bartholomew. The D1 Training system, which can be explored at https://www.d1training.com/fort-wayne-sw/, has grown to over 150 locations nationwide with 100 more in development, making it one of the fastest-growing private companies in the nation.</p><p>The opening represents a significant development in the fitness industry's expansion into community-based, science-backed training programs. By providing access to training methodologies previously available primarily to elite athletes, D1 Training addresses the growing demand for professional-level fitness instruction in local markets. The facility's approach emphasizes fundamental athletic development regardless of age or background, potentially influencing how fitness franchises structure their service offerings to cater to diverse demographic segments.</p><p>This expansion reflects broader trends in the fitness industry toward specialized, methodology-driven training concepts that leverage sports science principles. The growth of D1 Training's network to over 150 locations with additional development underway demonstrates the market's appetite for structured athletic training programs outside traditional gym settings, potentially signaling new opportunities for franchise models in the health and wellness sector.</p>
