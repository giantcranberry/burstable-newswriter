<p>Sectigo announced the successful completion of what it describes as the largest and most technically sophisticated migration of public certificate infrastructure in industry history. The milestone culminates Sectigo's strategic acquisition of Entrust's public certificate business and the full transition of customers and partners from Entrust Certificate Services to Sectigo Certificate Manager.</p><p>More than half a million certificates spanning a double-digit product portfolio were transitioned to the <a href="https://sectigo.com/certificate-manager" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">SCM platform</a>, an engineering achievement that positions customers with a future-ready Certificate Lifecycle Management platform designed for shrinking certificate lifespans and post-quantum cryptography readiness. According to Sectigo's <a href="https://sectigo.com/resource-library/state-of-crypto-agility-report" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">State of Crypto Agility Report</a>, 96% of enterprises express concern about the impact of shorter SSL/TLS certificate lifespans on their business operations, with only 19% feeling very prepared to support monthly certificate renewals.</p><p>Kevin Weiss, chief executive officer at Sectigo, stated that the company delivered on its promise to Entrust customers for a seamless migration. This migration sets a new benchmark for digital trust transitions and was made possible through the work of engineering, sales, and support teams who ensured customer confidence throughout the process. The migration framework included in-app guided workflows, extensive pre-validation automation, real-time user provisioning, and inventory synchronization across SSL, S/MIME and code signing certificates.</p><p>Mark Bilger, chief product and engineering officer at Sectigo, characterized the milestone as both a transformation exercise and migration. The company engineered a fully automated experience at unprecedented scale while delivering new capabilities that provide former Entrust customers with greater control, visibility and agility. The cloud-native, CA-agnostic platform manages every aspect of the certificate lifecycle from discovery and provisioning to revocation and renewal across all certificate types.</p><p>Customer feedback highlighted the immediate benefits of the transition. Brian Fisher, infrastructure team lead at Major Drilling Group International Inc., noted complete and immediate access to all certificates, workflows, and users with full validation eliminating issuance wait times. Miguel Vaquera, cloud administrator at SCOR's Velogica, reported gaining full visibility and control over certificates with a remarkably smooth migration process. Partners also praised the support received during migration, with Bruce Bulmer of DLS Technology Corporation noting that the partnership now empowers them to meet client certificate lifecycle management and cybersecurity needs with confidence.</p><p>The successful migration represents a significant industry consolidation that addresses pressing cybersecurity challenges facing modern enterprises. With certificate lifespans continuing to shorten and quantum computing threats looming, the transition provides organizations with enhanced tools to manage digital certificates at scale while maintaining operational continuity. The technical achievement demonstrates how large-scale infrastructure migrations can be executed without disrupting critical security operations, setting a precedent for future industry transitions in the rapidly evolving digital trust landscape.</p>
