<p>Daniel Salinas has returned to Lakeside Software as Chief Operating Officer, bringing over 25 years of enterprise IT leadership to oversee global Sales, Customer Success, Customer Support, and Business Development. Salinas previously served as Vice President of Business Development at Lakeside starting in 2010, working directly with CEO Mike Schumacher to establish the company's position in digital experience and desktop analytics.</p><p>Salinas emphasized that Lakeside's focus is evolving to address the needs of today's hybrid workplace by transforming endpoint management from reactive support to proactive site reliability engineering. Our focus is on giving EUC teams the same kind of data depth, actionable insights, and trustworthy automation that SREs rely on so they can get ahead of issues instead of chasing tickets, Salinas stated during the interview. This shift represents a fundamental change in how IT departments operate, moving from cost centers to strategic business partners.</p><p>The COO role in a high-growth SaaS company like Lakeside involves building scalable processes while maintaining customer focus. Salinas explained, I see my job as connecting the dots between the operational engine and the voice of the customer, so we can execute at scale while still listening closely and adapting quickly. This approach helps organizations transform IT from a behind-the-scenes function into what Salinas calls the hero of the business by demonstrating measurable business impact through data-driven decision making.</p><p>Salinas shared a compelling example of how Lakeside's technology delivers tangible business value. A major bank had a planned refresh of 7,000 laptops. Based on their real-world usage data from Lakeside's endpoint sensors, they learned that only 600 out of the 7,000 laptops actually needed replacing. This data-driven insight saved the organization approximately $9 million that could be redirected to other strategic projects, demonstrating the significant financial impact of intelligent endpoint management.</p><p>Lakeside's AI and automation capabilities are designed to create what Salinas describes as invisible ITâ€”solutions that work seamlessly in the background while employees focus on their work. The company helped one organization prevent more than 205,000 help desk tickets monthly through automated monitoring and issue resolution at https://www.lakesidesoftware.com. These measurable outcomes help justify IT investments while improving employee productivity and reducing operational costs, making technology an enabler rather than a barrier to business operations.</p><p>Salinas brings leadership lessons from his extensive career, including 18 years at IBM where he directed global sales initiatives around smart business desktop cloud solutions. His return to Lakeside signals the company's commitment to scaling its AI and edge observability capabilities during a period of rapid digital workplace transformation, positioning the organization to help businesses navigate the complexities of modern hybrid work environments through advanced analytics and automation technologies.</p>
