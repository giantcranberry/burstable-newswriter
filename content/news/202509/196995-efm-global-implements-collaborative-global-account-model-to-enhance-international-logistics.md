<p>EFM Global has transitioned to a global account model where offices across different time zones collaborate to provide consistent service for clients operating internationally. This approach was highlighted when a UK client expanding into Saudi Arabia faced shipment issues with their previous provider; EFM's UK and KSA teams worked together to manage shipments and hold stock locally until the client secured a warehouse, resulting in seamless service. The company tracks these accounts with annual revenue targets, but client feedback and referrals, such as a global fitness event operator recommending EFM from APAC to their US counterpart, are key measures of success.</p><p>In high-pressure environments like critical one-time events, trust is paramount. EFM quotes transparently, avoiding surprise costs, and plans for contingencies with backup sailings and alternative air routes. For the film Tenet, the company created a master project plan giving the studio full visibility and control over logistics. This preparedness was demonstrated when a promoter in Australia was told a carnet extension was impossible, threatening their tour; EFM's team secured the extension locally, keeping the schedule intact and turning the client into a long-term partner.</p><p>EFM's role in live entertainment logistics is distinct due to the high stakes involved, where delays can cancel shows and damage reputations. Recently, customs delays threatened a shipment to Mexico, but the team quickly secured alternative sailings and airfreight, rerouting containers across multiple ports to meet deadlines. This agility, built through historical scenarios, ensures that failure is not an option when stakes are high. The company positions itself as a strategic partner rather than just a logistics provider, acting as consultants who guide clients through complex challenges, such as resolving lost carnets for the Fashion Freak Show by orchestrating alternative routing.</p><p>Emerging trends in the sport and entertainment sectors include the growing importance of ESG, with clients seeking suppliers who share their values. EFM has partnered on carbon offset programs and greener transport options. Additionally, digitalization is rapidly approaching, with the new digital carnet system launching in April 2026 set to impact 90% of EFM's work. The company has already run pilot shipments to gain practical experience and prepare clients. Potential tariff changes, especially in the US, could also disrupt planning, and EFM monitors these developments to help clients adapt proactively.</p><p>EFM's differentiation lies in its people, with the EFM Pathway developing talent from junior to senior roles, blending multimodal knowledge with on-site experience. For example, Jason Bird joined as a junior and is now VP of Music after 20 years, exemplifying the depth of expertise that translates into client trust and revenue growth. Looking ahead, EFM plans to focus on growth in the US and expand into new verticals, supported by enhanced rate management tools and new sales platforms to streamline operations and maintain high standards at scale.</p>
