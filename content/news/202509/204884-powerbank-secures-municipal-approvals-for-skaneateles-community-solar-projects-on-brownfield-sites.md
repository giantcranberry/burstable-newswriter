<p>PowerBank Corporation has secured all required municipal approvals for two community solar projects on industrial brownfield sites in Skaneateles, New York. The projects, located in Onondaga County, have received variances, site plan approval, and a special use permit, marking a significant advancement in renewable energy infrastructure development for the region.</p><p>The approval process now progresses to the New York Department of Environmental Conservation for final authorization before construction can begin. Once operational, these projects will deliver clean energy directly to the local grid, enabling both renters and homeowners to subscribe to the solar energy program. Subscribers will receive bill credits without needing to install solar panels on their properties, making renewable energy accessible to a broader demographic.</p><p>These initiatives are supported by PowerBank's extensive experience in renewable energy development, including more than 100 megawatts of completed projects and a development pipeline exceeding one gigawatt. The company's track record in distributed and community solar projects positions it to execute these initiatives efficiently. Additional information about PowerBank's capabilities is available at <a href="https://www.powerbankcorp.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.powerbankcorp.com</a>.</p><p>The Skaneateles projects align with New York's Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act, which targets achieving 6 gigawatts of solar capacity by 2025. By developing solar projects on brownfield sites, PowerBank contributes to the state's renewable energy objectives while repurposing underutilized industrial land. This approach generates clean energy and promotes sustainable land use practices.</p><p>Community solar projects are essential for expanding renewable energy access, particularly for individuals unable to install solar panels due to rental status, property constraints, or financial barriers. The bill credit system allows participants to benefit from solar energy without upfront costs, supporting wider adoption of clean energy solutions. Further details about the projects can be found at <a href="https://ibn.fm/xDPgd" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://ibn.fm/xDPgd</a>.</p><p>The successful municipal approval process underscores growing local support for renewable energy initiatives, emphasizing the importance of collaboration between developers and communities. As New York advances its climate goals, such projects will be crucial in building a sustainable energy future, demonstrating the tangible benefits of repurposing brownfields for renewable energy generation.</p>
