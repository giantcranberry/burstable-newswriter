<p>HeartBeam (NASDAQ: BEAT) announced study results showing no significant differences in detecting atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, and sinus rhythm when its deep learning algorithms were applied to the HeartBeam System versus standard 12-lead ECGs. Data from 201 patients, presented at HRX Live 2025 in Atlanta by Dr. Joshua Lampert of Mount Sinai Heart, demonstrated high accuracy rates in both groups (94.5% HeartBeam vs. 95.5% standard 12-lead).</p><p>CEO Rob Eno stated that the findings highlight the potential of HeartBeam's compact, 3D device to expand advanced cardiac monitoring to settings where full 12-lead ECGs may be impractical. The company plans to use these results to support future FDA submissions for its innovative cardiac monitoring technology, which can be explored further at https://www.heartbeam.com.</p><p>The significance of this development lies in the potential to democratize access to sophisticated cardiac diagnostics. Traditional 12-lead ECGs require specialized equipment and clinical settings, limiting their availability in remote areas, home care, or emergency situations. HeartBeam's cable-free device, capable of collecting ECG signals in 3D from three non-coplanar directions and synthesizing them into a 12-lead ECG, could revolutionize how cardiac conditions are detected and monitored outside medical facilities.</p><p>HeartBeam's technology represents a major advancement in portable cardiac care. The system's ability to deliver comparable accuracy to gold-standard 12-lead ECGs while being more accessible and practical for various environments addresses a critical gap in cardiac healthcare. This could lead to earlier detection of arrhythmias, more continuous monitoring of cardiac patients, and improved management of heart conditions without requiring frequent hospital visits.</p><p>The company's 3D ECG technology received FDA clearance for arrhythmia assessment in December 2024, while the 12-lead ECG synthesis software remains under FDA review. With over 20 issued patents related to technology enablement, HeartBeam is positioned to transform cardiac care delivery through innovative portable solutions that maintain clinical-grade accuracy.
