<p>Blo Blow Dry Bar has opened its first Rhode Island location in East Greenwich, marking a significant expansion for North America's original blow dry bar franchise. The new bar at 1000 Division Street, Unit 64 began operations on October 3, with a grand opening celebration scheduled for October 16. This expansion represents both a business milestone and a personal homecoming for owner Maria M. Porreca, a Rhode Island native who plans to open three Blo locations throughout the state.</p><p>Porreca brings a unique perspective to the venture, having spent over a decade working in finance in New York City before returning to Rhode Island to be closer to family after her daughters were born. Her experience juggling motherhood and a demanding career helped shape her vision for the business. After years in Manhattan with weekly blowouts and numerous makeup appointments, I saw firsthand the difference a reliable, time-saving beauty service makes, Porreca explained. As a mom of six-year-old twins and someone who grew up around small business, I wanted to create a space that helps guests decompress and feel confident.</p><p>The East Greenwich location will offer Blo's signature blowouts, à la carte add-ons, hair treatments, and expert makeup services for events and special occasions. The brand distinguishes itself through its no cuts, no color concept focused exclusively on blowouts, with a menu featuring five signature styles from sleek and straight to bouncy curls, plus customized looks including updos and braids. For more information on services and booking, visit <a href="https://blomedry.com/blo-east-greenwich/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://blomedry.com/blo-east-greenwich/</a>.</p><p>To celebrate the opening, the East Greenwich bar is offering two limited-time promotions: a $75 founder's rate for the first 75 members of its Mane Squeeze Membership program, which includes two blowouts monthly plus additional perks, and a special $45 blowout rate through October 16. The membership program reflects Blo's evolution beyond basic services to include subscription models and retail products, demonstrating how beauty franchises are adapting to changing consumer preferences for recurring services.</p><p>The business operates with extended hours to accommodate busy schedules, open Monday through Wednesday from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m., Thursday through Saturday from 9 a.m. to 7 p.m., and Sunday from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m., with early morning and late evening appointments available from 7 a.m. to 9 a.m. and 7 p.m. to 9 p.m. This scheduling flexibility addresses the time constraints Porreca identified as a working mother and former financial executive, positioning the business to serve professionals and families seeking convenient beauty solutions.</p><p>Blo's mission emphasizes creating inclusive spaces where people of all ages, ethnicities, and orientations feel welcomed and represented while promoting self-care and wellness. The company, which launched in Canada in 2007, has grown to over 165 locations across the U.S. and Canada. Additional information about the brand's history and services can be found at <a href="https://www.blomedry.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.blomedry.com</a>.</p><p>The East Greenwich opening represents more than just another franchise location—it demonstrates how specialized beauty services can fill community needs while supporting local entrepreneurship. Porreca's background in both corporate finance and small business, combined with her understanding of the challenges facing working parents, positions this venture to serve as both a beauty destination and a community resource focused on convenience and self-care. The expansion signals continued growth potential for focused service businesses that address specific consumer pain points around time management and personal care.</p>
