<p>PVA TePla AG reinforced its medium-term growth objectives during the Capital Markets Day 2025 in London, targeting revenue of approximately €500 million by the end of 2028. The company aims to achieve increased profitability metrics including an EBITDA margin of 20 to 25% and a gross margin of 38 to 43%. CEO Jalin Ketter emphasized that strategic investments in technology and infrastructure are crucial for maintaining competitiveness in a challenging market environment.</p><p>The company reported strong performance in the first half of 2025 with revenue of €119.6 million and a gross margin of 33.3%, alongside order intake of €103.6 million. Significant investments are being made across production, sales, and service infrastructures in Germany, Italy, France, Asia, and North America to bolster presence in key strategic markets. These developments underscore PVA TePla's commitment to expanding its global footprint while enhancing operational capabilities.</p><p>A notable strategic shift involves transitioning financial reporting to focus on product areas rather than industries. Beginning in fiscal year 2026, reporting will be structured around Metrology and Material Solutions divisions, replacing the previous Semiconductor Systems and Industrial Systems categorization. CFO Markus GroB stated that this change aims to provide greater transparency and align with clear margin targets, reflecting the company's evolution and diversified market approach.</p><p>PVA TePla's growth is driven by its broad technology portfolio addressing multiple high-growth sectors. The Metrology division benefits from acoustic measurement systems for the semiconductor industry, while Material Solutions technologies serve renewable energies, aerospace, defense, and other high-tech markets. This diversification reduces dependence on individual industries and mitigates cyclical market fluctuations. The expansion of the integrated R&D center, known as the Technology Hub, accelerates the transfer of research成果 into industrial applications and shortens time to market for innovative solutions.</p><p>The company's strategic outlook highlights how addressing global challenges in digitalization, decarbonization, and mobility through advanced materials and metrology technologies positions PVA TePla for sustained growth. The successful Capital Markets Day presentation to international investors and analysts demonstrated confidence in achieving these ambitious targets through continued innovation and market expansion.</p>
