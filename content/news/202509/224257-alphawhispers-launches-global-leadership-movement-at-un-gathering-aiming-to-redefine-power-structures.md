<p>AlphaWhispers hosted its premier event, AlphaWhispers House New York, at the United Nations Delegates Dining Room during UNGA80 on September 22, 2025. The gathering marked the launch of a global convening series designed to reframe power and influence at the highest levels of society and co-create a new model of leadership that fuses power, influence, and values. Themed "Powering the Future: A New Breed of Exponential Leaders," the event brought together global executives, innovators, and cultural leaders for an afternoon of dialogue, performance, and calls to action.</p><p>Opening remarks were delivered by Janet C. Salazar, Founder & CEO of AlphaWhispers International Network, Chairman of the Foundation for the Support of the United Nations, and creator of ALPHAWHISPERERS: Power Behind the Power, alongside Joshua W. Walker, Ph.D., President & CEO of Japan Society. Salazar declared that "Alpha Whisperers—the unseen power behind the power—are stepping forward to shape a future that is more innovative, inclusive, sustainable, and just. This movement is not just an event, it is a rallying point for systemic, generational change."</p><p>The Frequency School, led by Grammy-nominated artist Maejor with Martina Fuchs, Kingsley M, Brandon Lee, and Aaron Dawson, opened the program with a performance combining sound therapy and wellness. The generational leadership spotlight featured Tomonari Abe, 10th Generation CEO of Abe Yoando Pharma, who shared how deep roots in a 300-year-old company powered his "moonshot" vision for the future. Fireside chats featured Demee Koch, Founder & CEO of DE MOI, and Amantia Muhedini, Head of Sustainable & Impact Investing Americas at UBS GWM, with reflections on beauty, impact, and capital as forces for good.</p><p>Keynote addresses included Dr. Kellyann Petrucci, bestselling author and health visionary, and Dr. Hidekazu Yamada, President of the Japanese Society of Anti-Aging Medicine. Panels brought together leaders including Shifra Ansonoff from BlackRock, Annabelle Manalo-Morgan, PhD from Masaya Medical, Hiroshi Abe from Abe Yoando Pharma, Lindsay O'Neill from Wellness Eternal & Biohacking Index, Nick Akira Yoshida from Abe Yoando Pharma, and Kelly Gushue, moderated by journalist Martina Fuchs. Performances by Roy "Gramps" Morgan, three-time Grammy winner and "King of Country Reggae," uplifted attendees.</p><p>Founded by Janet C. Salazar and incubated during her <a href="https://www.rockefellerfoundation.org" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Rockefeller Foundation</a> Bellagio Residency in 2023, the initiative convenes strategists and advisors whose quiet yet outsized influence can power a more equitable future. AlphaWhispers represents a breakthrough global leadership engine focused on reframing how power and influence operate in society, with the goal of humanizing and democratizing decision-making for systemic change. With its New York debut complete, the AlphaWhispers House series will continue at global leadership stages including Davos, Washington, DC, and Athena, advancing its mission to drive a revolution in how leadership is defined and practiced.</p>
