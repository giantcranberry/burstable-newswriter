<p>Francine Teng, Design Director at Navigation Capital Group, has played a pivotal role in shaping Monogram New York, an Art Deco-inspired residential tower in midtown Manhattan. Her leadership in guiding the overall architectural and interior design vision demonstrates how strategic design decisions can create commercially successful properties that resonate with modern urban living while honoring historical context.</p><p>Teng's responsibilities included close collaboration with architectural firm <a href="https://www.ismaelleyva.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Ismael Leyva Architects</a> and interior design studio <a href="https://www.neriandhu.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Neri&Hu</a>, ensuring every element aligned with development objectives and brand positioning. This collaborative approach highlights the importance of cross-functional coordination in high-end real estate development, where aesthetic vision must balance with practical functionality and market expectations.</p><p>The building's design incorporates subtle references to New York's Art Deco tradition through geometry, proportion, and materiality, rather than replicating historical motifs. This reinterpretation gives Monogram a sense of continuity with the city's architectural heritage while projecting a modern identity. The exterior presence remains restrained and elegant, integrating seamlessly with the Manhattan skyline, while interiors express warmth, sophistication, and refined residential character.</p><p>Teng emphasized the selection of Ismael Leyva Architects for their expertise in high-density urban residential design and ability to optimize floor plans for livability. The architectural choices prioritize clarity of facade composition paired with functional, light-filled interiors, creating an equilibrium between design expression and resident comfort that is fundamental to the project's success.</p><p>For the interiors, Neri&Hu was chosen for their internationally respected design perspective and skill in creating immersive, narrative-rich environments. The Sphere Club amenities feature natural materials, careful lighting, and spatial layering to create tranquility and retreat, while residences showcase attention to craftsmanship through custom joinery and material contrasts that establish intimacy, refinement, and long-term value for homeowners.</p><p>The living experience at Monogram combines curated luxury with daily practicality, featuring well-considered layouts, abundant natural light, and premium finishes selected for both beauty and longevity. This holistic residential environment reflects the rhythm and aspirations of New York City living, demonstrating how thoughtful design can enhance urban lifestyle experiences while maintaining commercial viability in competitive real estate markets.</p>
