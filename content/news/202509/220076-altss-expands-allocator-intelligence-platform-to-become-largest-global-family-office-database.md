<p>Altss has significantly expanded its allocator intelligence platform, increasing verified family-office coverage to 9,000 entities, making it the largest family-office database globally. The platform update targets general partners and investor-relations teams requiring current, decision-grade context on allocation patterns, timing, and motivations behind investment decisions.</p><p>The platform emphasizes evidence, recency, and provenance, with profiles refreshed frequently and enriched with open-source intelligence indicators that influence allocator behavior. These indicators include mandate shifts, new fund activity, team and board changes, and conference participation. Precision filtering capabilities support research, due-diligence, and meeting-preparation workflows across strategy, stage, geography, structure, and commitment profiles.</p><p>Scale only matters if it's current, according to Dawid Siekiera, Founder of Altss. By combining the largest verified family-office coverage with live limited partner signals and transparent sourcing, the platform helps teams focus on allocators most likely to be relevant both currently and in the coming weeks as the company expands to full LP coverage. The family-office intelligence spans North America, Europe, the Middle East, Asia-Pacific, and Latin America.</p><p>The expansion introduces several key features, including 9,000+ verified family offices mapped with practical fields for triage and preparation, live LP context through OSINT signals on mandates and team movements, fast refresh cycles with change-triggered updates, and research-grade filters for allocator research and capital-formation planning. Over the next few weeks, Altss will extend coverage to include institutional LPs such as pensions, insurers, endowments, sovereign funds, corporates, banks, and registered investment advisors.</p><p>Subsequent phases will broaden the platform's scope to include startups and funds across venture, growth, and private equity sectors. This approach combines the breadth of legacy market databases with relationship context and social-listening signals similar to those used by advanced intelligence platforms. With this expansion, Altss positions itself as a decision-grade alternative to traditional market databases, prioritizing current data, transparent provenance, and a graph structure that reflects actual capital movement patterns in private markets.
