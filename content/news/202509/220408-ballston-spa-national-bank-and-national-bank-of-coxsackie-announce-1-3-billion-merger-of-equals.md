<p>The merger of Ballston Spa Bancorp and NBC Bancorp will establish a $1.3 billion community banking institution serving the greater Capital District and surrounding markets. This strategic combination brings together two historically significant banks with deep community roots, creating an entity that aims to compete more effectively in the evolving regional banking landscape while maintaining personalized service approaches.</p><p>The leadership structure reflects the merger's balanced approach, with Richard P. Sleasman, current Chairman of BSNB's Board of Directors, serving as Chairperson of the combined board. Christopher R. Dowd, President and CEO of BSNB, will become Chief Executive Officer, while John A. Balli, President and CEO of NBC, will assume the role of President. The board composition includes nine directors from BSNB and four from NBC, proportional to the ownership structure resulting from the transaction.</p><p>Christopher R. Dowd emphasized the strategic benefits, noting that the merged entity will have "a larger market capitalization, greater lending limit and increased visibility and liquidity, unlocking value for both sets of shareholders." The transaction details specify that NBC shareholders will receive 0.8065 shares of BSNB stock for each share of NBC stock in a tax-free exchange, resulting in BSNB shareholders owning approximately 66% of the combined company and NBC shareholders owning 34%.</p><p>The merger creates substantial operational advantages for customers, including expanded branch networks, surcharge-free ATM access, and enhanced digital banking capabilities. John A. Balli highlighted the cultural alignment between the institutions, stating that "joining forces will expand our combined footprint, create a larger, more competitive institution in the Capital Region and open the door to new opportunities for lending, investment and community partnerships." The combined bank will serve customers through 21 branches across Albany, Saratoga, Greene, and Schoharie Counties.</p><p>Financial advisors played crucial roles in the transaction, with <a href="https://www.griffinfinancialgroup.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Griffin Financial Group, LLC</a> serving as exclusive financial advisor to BSNB and <a href="https://www.janney.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Janney Montgomery Scott, LLC</a> advising NBC. Both companies have made detailed investor presentations available on their respective websites at <a href="https://www.bsnb.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">www.bsnb.com</a> for BSNB and <a href="https://investors.nbcoxsackie.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://investors.nbcoxsackie.com</a> for NBC.</p><p>The transaction has received unanimous approval from both boards of directors and is expected to close in the second quarter of 2026, pending regulatory and shareholder approvals. BSNB intends to raise approximately $20 million in subordinated debt prior to closing to fund growth opportunities in its markets. This merger combines institutions with significant historical presence, with Ballston Spa National Bank founded in 1838 managing approximately $912 million in assets through 13 branches, while The National Bank of Coxsackie, established in 1852, holds $525 million in assets across 8 branches.</p><p>The strategic combination represents a response to evolving customer expectations and market dynamics while preserving the community banking philosophy that both institutions have maintained throughout their histories. The merged entity will leverage nearly 375 years of combined banking experience while positioning itself for future growth in the competitive Capital Region market, addressing demonstrated consumer and business needs for personalized service, greater flexibility and diversity in products.</p>
