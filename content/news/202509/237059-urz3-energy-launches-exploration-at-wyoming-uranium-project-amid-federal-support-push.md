<p>URZ3 Energy Corp has launched an exploration program at its Dry Fork Uranium Project in Wyoming's Powder River Basin, strategically positioned just 10 kilometers from the established Nichols Ranch Uranium Project. The initiative comes as federal support for domestic uranium production intensifies, with the company aiming to evaluate the property's potential for in-situ recovery uranium extraction methods.</p><p>The exploration program will focus initially on identifying areas with uranium-bearing groundwater that could indicate subsurface mineralization compatible with ISR methods. The first phase will concentrate on sampling around known water springs to detect anomalous uranium levels, while a second phase will employ handheld spectrometers to locate additional springs and surface seeps carrying uranium concentrations. Mark Kolebaba, President and CEO of URZ3 Energy Corp., emphasized that focusing on hydrogeological indicators represents a cost-effective, scientific approach to prioritizing drill targets.</p><p>The timing aligns with strengthened U.S. government commitment to domestic uranium supply. In a recent Bloomberg interview, U.S. Secretary of Energy Christopher Wright highlighted the need to bolster the strategic uranium reserve to reduce foreign dependency and support nuclear energy expansion. The Strategic Uranium Reserve program, established in 2020, has already resulted in government purchases of one million pounds of U₃O₈ at premium prices, demonstrating federal dedication to domestic supply security.</p><p>Further reinforcing this commitment, the Department of Energy announced on August 22, 2025, the creation of a Defense Production Act Consortium designed to expand domestic fuel availability, enhance power reliability, and accelerate progress toward nuclear energy independence. These developments signal growing recognition of uranium's critical role in America's clean energy future and national security.</p><p>The exploration program at Dry Fork represents a measured approach to resource development, with systematic ground grid surveys planned to refine exploration targets and guide future drilling decisions. Jim Ebisch, a qualified professional geologist as defined by National Instrument 43-101, will oversee data review for the project, ensuring adherence to industry standards and regulatory requirements.</p><p>As global demand for carbon-free nuclear energy continues to rise, URZ3's exploration activities in Wyoming's proven uranium district align with broader national objectives to secure reliable domestic supply chains. The company's methodology of targeting ISR-amenable uranium resources reflects evolving industry practices that prioritize environmentally conscious extraction methods while supporting America's energy independence goals. The Dry Fork project forms part of URZ3's broader portfolio of properties in Wyoming and the southwestern United States where renewed momentum is emerging due to federal incentives and streamlined pathways for uranium exploration and production.</p>
