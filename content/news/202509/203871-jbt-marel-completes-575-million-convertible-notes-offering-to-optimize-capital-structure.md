<p>JBT Marel Corporation announced the closing of its private offering of $575 million aggregate principal amount of 0.375 percent convertible senior notes due 2030. The offering included $75 million in additional notes issued through the initial purchasers' full option exercise. This substantial capital markets transaction represents a strategic financial maneuver by the global technology solutions provider that serves high-value segments of the food and beverage industry through its comprehensive technology, systems, and software offerings available at <a href="https://www.jbtmarel.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.jbtmarel.com</a>.</p><p>According to Matt Meister, Chief Financial Officer, the company took advantage of the robust convertible market and its low borrowing costs. The notes, with a coupon rate of 37.5 basis points, are expected to generate meaningful annual interest expense savings compared to traditional high-yield note issuances. This approach demonstrates JBT Marel's sophisticated financial management strategy in optimizing capital structure while maintaining cost efficiency.</p><p>The strategic financial move includes corresponding convertible note hedge and warrant transactions that effectively mitigate shareholder dilution until the company's share price reaches $283.42 per share. This protective mechanism ensures that existing shareholder value is preserved while the company accesses low-cost capital. The company utilized the net proceeds to execute these hedging transactions while repaying a portion of outstanding borrowings under its revolving credit facility.</p><p>JBT Marel Corporation subsequently intends to draw on its revolving credit facility and/or use cash on hand to repay or otherwise refinance its 0.25 percent convertible senior notes due 2026 at or prior to their maturity. This refinancing strategy positions the company for improved financial flexibility and reduced interest burden in the coming years, potentially freeing up capital for further technological innovation and market expansion.</p><p>The notes were offered exclusively to qualified institutional buyers under Rule 144A of the Securities Act of 1933, ensuring compliance with securities regulations. For business and technology leaders, this transaction highlights the importance of strategic capital management in maintaining competitive advantage, particularly for companies operating in capital-intensive technology sectors where efficient financing can directly impact innovation capacity and market positioning.</p>
