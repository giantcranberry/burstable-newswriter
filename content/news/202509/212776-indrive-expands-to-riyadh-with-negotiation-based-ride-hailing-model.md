<p>inDrive, the world's second most-downloaded ride-hailing application, has expanded its operations to Riyadh, marking its second city launch in Saudi Arabia and reinforcing its presence in one of the world's fastest-growing regions. The Riyadh expansion builds upon demonstrated market interest in the Kingdom and continues the company's investment in service quality and safety measures, including comprehensive driver verification protocols, real-time ride tracking capabilities, and around-the-clock customer support services.</p><p>The platform's distinctive business model allows riders to propose fares directly to drivers, who then choose to accept, decline, or counter the offer through transparent in-app negotiations. This approach enables both parties to reach mutually agreeable pricing terms while providing drivers with service fees that are typically two to three times lower than standard industry rates. The company maintains strong market positions across the Middle East and North Africa region, holding top rankings in Morocco, Egypt, and Algeria, reflecting sustained user demand for affordable and equitable transportation services.</p><p>inDrive's strategic framework is specifically designed for rapidly evolving, mobile-first economies where consumers increasingly demand services that balance affordability with fairness. The company recently began deploying a modular SuperApp architecture anchored by high-frequency daily services such as grocery delivery, which enhances user engagement and creates natural cross-selling opportunities into mobility solutions, courier services, fintech offerings, and additional urban services. Super app markets will feature locally relevant service combinations rather than employing a standardized, one-size-fits-all approach.</p><p>Founder and CEO Arsen Tomsky emphasized that Riyadh represents a significant milestone for the company, stating they are building a platform that treats users fairly while restoring genuine choice through their scalable negotiation model. The business has completed over 6.5 billion transactions globally and surpassed 360 million application downloads worldwide, operating through a capital-efficient model characterized by low customer acquisition costs and high retention rates that has already achieved EBITDA profitability while delivering double-digit growth during the first half of this year.
