The 124,000-square-foot shopping center, located at 2920 N.

These businesses join existing anchor tenants such as Bashas', Ace Hardware, Big 5 Sporting Goods, and national brands including Starbucks, Subway, and Orangetheory. The diverse tenant mix reflects the center's appeal to both local and national retailers.</p><p>Western Retail Advisors brokers Bryan Ledbetter, Bryan Babits, Katie Weeks, and Leslie Araujo represented property owner Furst Jacobs LLC in all leasing transactions.
