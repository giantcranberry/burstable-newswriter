<p>DAUM Commercial Real Estate Services has announced the full entitlement and pre-leasing of the Apple Valley AV One Million Distribution Center, a 1,080,078 square foot industrial facility representing the first phase of a 550-acre master-planned development by Los Angeles-based Uncommon Developers. The completion of entitlement processes enables rapid groundbreaking and vertical construction to meet target occupancy dates, addressing the critical shortage of large-scale industrial space in Southern California.</p><p>According to Rick John, SIOR, Executive Vice President and Branch Manager at DAUM's Inland Empire Office, the facility's expansive footprint, modern infrastructure, and transportation connectivity will support large-scale distribution, manufacturing, and logistics operations. The property offers an increasingly rare opportunity for businesses seeking to optimize supply chain operations in Southern California's constrained industrial market, where vacancy rates remain near historic lows.</p><p>The High Desert North Inland Empire region is attracting significant industrial development due to its business-friendly environment and growing skilled labor pool, while maintaining proximity within 100 miles of the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach. Dan Foye, Executive Vice President and Principal at DAUM, notes that more affordable land and lease rates compared to Los Angeles and other Inland Empire markets, combined with reduced congestion, provide substantial cost savings and operational efficiencies for developers and occupiers.</p><p>The development benefits from direct access to <a href="https://www.fhwa.dot.gov" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Interstate 15</a>, State Route 18, and US Route 395, while also being positioned near Southern California Logistics Airport, a major cargo hub, and the upcoming Barstow International Gateway. This strategic location facilitates highly efficient regional and national distribution capabilities that leverage the area's unique transportation advantages for companies requiring rapid access to both coastal ports and inland markets.</p><p>The facility specifications include a 40-foot minimum building height, 219 dock-high doors, four ground-level doors, EV charging stations for cars and trucks, and 8,000 amps of power expandable to 16,000 amps. The 72-acre site provides ample car and trailer parking alongside office and mezzanine space, making it one of the most comprehensively equipped industrial properties in the region capable of supporting advanced automation and robotics systems.</p><p>The project represents significant economic development for the High Desert region and demonstrates the ongoing expansion of Southern California's industrial infrastructure to meet growing logistics demands driven by e-commerce growth and supply chain diversification. The full entitlement achievement marks a critical milestone in bringing large-scale, modern distribution capabilities to a market experiencing increasing demand for sophisticated supply chain solutions that can accommodate evolving business requirements.</p>
