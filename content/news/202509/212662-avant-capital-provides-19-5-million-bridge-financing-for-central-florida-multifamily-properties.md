<p>Avant Capital, a Connecticut-based commercial real estate bridge lender, has originated a $19,490,000 bridge loan secured by two multifamily properties in Central Florida. The financing supports Terra Villa Park, a 41-unit residential and 3-unit commercial mixed-use property in Winter Springs, and Terra Hill Apartments, a 76-unit multifamily community in Winter Haven.</p><p>The transaction underscores the strength of Central Florida's multifamily market, which continues to benefit from robust demographic and economic trends including strong job growth, population in-migration, and sustained housing demand. Winter Springs offers residents a walkable, town center environment in a high-income Orlando suburb, while the Winter Haven property is positioned within a fast-growing market supported by major employers such as Publix, Walmart, and Lakeland Regional Health.</p><p>Adam Luysterborghs, Managing Principal of Avant, stated that this financing exemplifies the company's core focus on providing flexible capital to experienced multifamily sponsors. Both properties are well-occupied with recent capital improvements and additional upside potential from ongoing renovations, making them attractive investments in growth markets.</p><p>In 2025, Avant is targeting similar projects ranging from $1 million to $75 million nationwide with a focus on multifamily and industrial assets across high-growth markets including Florida, Texas, North Carolina, Georgia, and Colorado. The company also acquires non-performing loans secured by commercial real estate.
