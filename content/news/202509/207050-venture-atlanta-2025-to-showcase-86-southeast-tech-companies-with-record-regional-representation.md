<p>Venture Atlanta has selected 86 technology companies to present at its 18th annual conference scheduled for October 15-16 at The Woodruff Arts Center and Atlanta Symphony Hall. The event, one of the nation's largest venture capital conferences, is expected to draw more than 1,600 attendees including 450 investors from across the country, solidifying its position as a premier gathering for the Southeast's technology innovation ecosystem.</p><p>This year's conference features expanded programming and enhanced networking opportunities designed to deliver greater value to startups, growth-stage companies, investors, and ecosystem builders. New additions include a Procurement Palooza featuring 15 procurement leaders from the region's largest enterprises, providing attendees with unprecedented access to decision-makers and potential supplier opportunities. Allyson Eman, CEO of Venture Atlanta, stated that the quality of companies represents the best the organization has ever seen.</p><p>The 2025 conference will showcase the broadest regional representation in the event's history, with companies from 14 markets across the Southeast including Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, and Washington, D.C. This extensive geographic coverage enables investors to connect with top companies from across all these markets in just two days, rather than requiring separate trips to multiple states over several months.</p><p>Venture Atlanta's track record demonstrates substantial impact, having helped launch more than 930 companies that have raised over $8 billion in capital and achieved $20.8 billion in successful exits. Notable alumni include companies that have secured major funding rounds such as Flock Safety's $275 million raise and VIVA Finance's $220 million, along with multiple acquisitions. The organization has evolved from a regional showcase into one of the nation's most impactful venture communities.</p><p>The conference will host pitch competitions for early-stage and growth-stage companies, including the Startup Showcase Live competition for pre-seed and seed-stage companies. The winner of this competition will receive a $375,000 investment prize funded by Cofounders Capital, Front Porch Venture Partners, Knoll Ventures, and TiE Atlanta Angels. The initial round of pitches will be voted on by the conference audience, who will determine which companies advance to be judged by an investor panel.</p><p>Emery Waddell, General Partner at Vocap Partners and Venture Atlanta Board Member, emphasized that the conference has become the Southeast's essential tech event, continually evolving to better serve the ecosystem. The organization has deepened partnerships with leading accelerators, incubators, and venture capital conferences across the region. Garrett Langley, Founder and CEO of Flock Safety and a Venture Atlanta alum who pitched in 2020, will deliver the keynote address, sharing insights from building Flock into a $7.5 billion safety technology company.</p><p>The event is presented by Invesco QQQ as Title Sponsor, with J.P.Morgan as Premier Sponsor and additional Headline Sponsors including Cherry Bekaert, ExtensisHR, Gunderson Dettmer, and Marketwake. More than 95 sponsors support Venture Atlanta 2025, reflecting the broad community engagement that makes the conference possible and underscoring the growing importance of the Southeast as a technology innovation hub.</p>
