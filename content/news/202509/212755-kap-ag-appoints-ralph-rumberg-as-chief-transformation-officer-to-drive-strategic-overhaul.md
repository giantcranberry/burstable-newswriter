<p>The Supervisory Board of KAP AG has appointed Ralph Rumberg to the Company's Management Board as Chief Transformation Officer for a twelve-month term. This strategic move aims to enhance the Group's competitiveness in a rapidly evolving market environment and accelerate the implementation of transformation initiatives.</p><p>Rumberg's primary responsibilities will include speeding up operational performance improvements across KAP's portfolio companies and developing a future concept that ensures sustained profitability. He joins Marten Julius, Thorsten Diel, and Stefan Deller on the Management Board, though Diel and Deller's temporary appointments are set to conclude as planned on October 9, 2025.</p><p>Christian Schmitz, Chairman of KAP AG's Supervisory Board, emphasized Rumberg's proven expertise in transformation and strategy programs for industrial holding companies, expressing confidence that his leadership will inject new momentum into the organization. Marten Julius, Spokesman of the Management Board, noted that initial progress has already been made in portfolio optimization, process streamlining, and structural adaptations, with Rumberg's appointment expected to further accelerate these efforts.</p><p>Rumberg brings extensive industrial sector experience, including previous roles at BMW Motorsport, AMG Mercedes-Benz, Bosch Rexroth, and KOKI Technik. Most recently, he served as CEO of GESCO SE for six years, where he successfully restructured the investment portfolio, reduced automotive sector dependency, and implemented comprehensive strategic programs. Rumberg expressed enthusiasm for his new role and commitment to leveraging his transformation experience to optimally develop KAP AG.</p><p>This appointment signals KAP AG's intensified focus on operational excellence and strategic repositioning in response to market pressures. For business leaders, Rumberg's track record at GESCO SE demonstrates the potential for successful portfolio restructuring and reduced sector concentration risks. The twelve-month term suggests a targeted, results-driven approach to transformation that could serve as a model for other industrial holding companies facing similar challenges.</p><p>The timing of this leadership addition, coinciding with the planned conclusion of two other temporary board appointments, indicates a carefully orchestrated transition phase for KAP AG. Industry observers will monitor how Rumberg's expertise in automotive and industrial transformation translates to accelerated performance improvements across KAP's diverse portfolio companies.</p>
