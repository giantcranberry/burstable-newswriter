<p>Nicola Mining Inc. has secured five-year extensions for six mining leases at its New Craigmont Property, providing long-term security for exploration and development activities across more than 10,800 hectares adjacent to Teck Resources' Highland Valley Copper Mine. This strategic location positions the company alongside Canada's largest copper operation, enhancing the property's mineral potential value.</p><p>Concurrently, the company reported shipping 707 ounces of gold concentrate in partnership with Talisker Resources Ltd., generating gross proceeds of approximately US$2.3 million. This revenue stream has been supported by recent upgrades to the company's Merritt Mill facility, which has enhanced processing capabilities for both gold and silver mill feed through advanced gravity and flotation processes.</p><p>The company has initiated a substantial 4,000-to-5,000-meter diamond drill program at New Craigmont that began on June 1. This exploration program represents a significant investment in defining the property's mineral potential, particularly given its strategic location along the southern end of the Guichon Batholith and adjacency to Canada's largest copper mine. Coverage of these developments was provided by Mark Reichman, Managing Director and Equity Research Analyst at Noble Capital Markets. Investors seeking detailed analysis can access the full report through <a href="https://ibn.fm/WedjL" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://ibn.fm/WedjL</a> for comprehensive market insights.</p><p>The combination of extended mineral leases, active drilling programs, and revenue generation from gold shipments demonstrates Nicola Mining's progress in advancing its portfolio of mining assets. The company's fully permitted mill and tailings facility near Merritt, British Columbia, provides critical infrastructure support for current and future operations. Additional information and updates relating to Nicola Mining are available through the company's newsroom at <a href="https://ibn.fm/HUSIF" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://ibn.fm/HUSIF</a>, providing stakeholders with ongoing access to corporate developments and operational milestones.</p><p>For business and technology leaders in the mining sector, these developments highlight the importance of strategic asset positioning, infrastructure investment, and diversified revenue streams. The proximity to established mining operations reduces exploration risk while the upgraded processing facilities demonstrate operational efficiency improvements that could serve as a model for smaller mining companies seeking to maximize asset value through technological enhancements.</p>
