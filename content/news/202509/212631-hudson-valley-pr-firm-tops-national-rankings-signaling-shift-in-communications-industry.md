<p>Impact PR & Communications has been ranked as the top public relations and communications agency in the United States according to CommPRO's August 2025 industry ranking. The Hudson Valley-based firm's achievement represents a significant shift in the communications landscape, proving that regional agencies can effectively compete with established firms in major metropolitan areas.</p><p>The ranking was calculated through a weighted analysis of key indicators using <a href="https://www.communicationsmatch.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">CommunicationsMatch</a> agency search data, marking the first time the New York-based firm has appeared on the prestigious list. CEO and founder Filomena Fanelli attributed the achievement to the agency's purpose-driven approach and focus on delivering measurable business results for clients.</p><p>Fay Shapiro, publisher of CommPRO, noted that the monthly rankings reflect remarkable changes across the communications industry. The data suggests clients are increasingly prioritizing specific expertise and cultural fit over agency size or location, opening the door for a more diverse, dynamic, and competitive agency landscape.</p><p>Simon Erskine Locke, founder and CEO of CommunicationsMatch, emphasized the broader implications of the ranking. As the platform approaches three quarters of a million searches, Impact PR & Communication's number one ranking demonstrates that regionally-based agencies with deep community roots can achieve national traction. This trend indicates a fundamental shift in how businesses select communication partners, moving away from traditional geographic constraints.</p><p>The recognition comes as Impact PR & Communications continues to expand its diverse client portfolio, which includes banks and credit unions, financial advisors, real estate developers, food and beverage brands, tourism destinations, and nonprofit organizations. The firm's recent accolades include being nominated for The Business Council of New York's MWBE Awards and receiving the U.S. Small Business Administration's Top Women-Run Workplace recognition in the New York Metro region in 2024.</p><p>The agency's rise to the top position challenges conventional wisdom about the communications industry hierarchy and suggests that client preferences are evolving toward more specialized, community-connected firms that can deliver targeted results regardless of geographic location. This development has significant implications for the entire communications industry, potentially leveling the playing field for agencies outside major urban centers and encouraging more diverse representation in the field.</p>
