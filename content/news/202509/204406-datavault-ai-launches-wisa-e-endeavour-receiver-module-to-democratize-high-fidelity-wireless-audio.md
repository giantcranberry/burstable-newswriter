<p>Datavault AI has introduced the WiSA E Endeavour Receiver Module, a wireless audio solution designed to lower costs while enhancing performance for speaker and subwoofer manufacturers. The module integrates patented WiSA E Express multichannel wireless audio software into Android and Linux-based streaming platforms, marking a significant advancement in price, scale, and availability for emerging markets.</p><p>Protected by key patents including <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US9237407" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">US9237407</a> for multi-channel wireless digital audio distribution, <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US9723580" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">US9723580</a> for audio channel synchronization, and <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US11062722" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">US11062722</a> for stream adaptation latency, the Endeavour module delivers uncompressed, high-fidelity sound with fixed low latency and seamless multi-channel scalability. Nathaniel Bradley, CEO of Datavault AI, emphasized that the technology enables partners to create premium audio experiences at scale, prioritizing interoperability, performance, and affordability.</p><p>The compact module can receive up to two channels of uncompressed 16- or 24-bit/48 kHz audio and is fully interoperable with any WiSA E transmitter. It supports scalable configurations of up to eight audio channels, allowing cost-sensitive OEMs to integrate premium wireless audio into entry-level and mid-tier products. This flexibility enables enhanced audio experiences for WiSA E-enabled TVs, projectors, or soundbars by wirelessly adding subwoofers or surround channels.</p><p>WiSA E Endeavour outperforms Bluetooth LE across critical metrics, operating in the interference-resistant 5GHz band rather than the congested 2.4GHz spectrum. Unlike Bluetooth, it transmits uncompressed audio without compression artifacts, ensuring full fidelity and flawless audio-visual synchronization. The module also eliminates the need for proprietary codecs or additional components, reducing bill of materials costs and simplifying system integration.</p><p>Leveraging Datavault AI's extensive acoustic patent portfolios, including <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US9554211" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">US9554211</a> for wireless speaker units and <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US11356776" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">US11356776</a> for one-button wireless speaker association, the technology advances the WiSA Association's mission of enabling widespread adoption in consumer electronics focused on sound quality. WiSA President Tony Ostrom stated that the receiver expands access to high-quality, interoperable sound from beloved global brands.</p><p>The global soundbar market presents substantial growth opportunities for the Endeavour module, projected to expand at a compound annual growth rate of 8.3% from 2025 to 2030. According to Mordor Intelligence, the market is expected to grow from $9.53 billion in 2025 to $14.20 billion by 2030, driven by consumer demand for affordable, space-efficient audio solutions. This growth underscores the potential for OEMs to deliver differentiated wireless audio that meets rising expectations for quality and performance.</p><p>Engineering samples and development kits for the WiSA E Endeavour Receiver Module are currently available, with volume production scheduled to begin this quarter. Datavault AI is working with Greenberg Traurig, LLP to develop global licensing strategies and standards-based partnerships with international IP holders.</p>
