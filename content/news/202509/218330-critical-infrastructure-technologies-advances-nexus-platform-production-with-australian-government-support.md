<p>Critical Infrastructure Technologies Ltd. has commenced steel fabrication for the first three Nexus platforms after securing an Australian Government Grant, representing a crucial milestone in the commercialization of its autonomous mobile communications technology. Production is currently underway for Nexus 1, 2, and 3, with two additional platforms scheduled to follow in the coming months, demonstrating the company's rapid scaling capabilities in critical infrastructure technology solutions.</p><p>The company anticipates delivery of Nexus 1 and 2 within 10 weeks, while Nexus 3 is expected by the end of January 2026. Upon arrival at CiTech's production facility, each platform will undergo final fit-out procedures requiring approximately 4-6 weeks for completion. This accelerated production timeline underscores the company's operational efficiency and readiness to meet growing demand for deployable communication infrastructure.</p><p>Completed Nexus platforms will undergo demonstrations and pilot programs with major Western Australian mining companies, the Australian Defence Force, and various emergency services departments. These engagements will showcase the platform's versatility across multiple critical sectors including mining operations, defense applications, and emergency response scenarios. The technology addresses limitations in current rapidly deployable communication solutions through its self-deploying platform design, which supports various payloads including LTE equipment and surveillance systems.</p><p>Production of Nexus 4 and 5 is scheduled to commence in November 2025, with one platform destined for direct shipment to Poland for final fit-out. This unit will participate in a European product roadshow during March and April 2026, responding to significant interest from defense, government, and industry stakeholders across the European Union. The international expansion highlights the global applicability of CiTech's technology in addressing critical infrastructure needs beyond Australian borders.</p><p>Brenton Scott, CEO of CiTech, emphasized that this production milestone reflects the growing momentum behind the Nexus program, supported by both government backing and global partnerships. The upcoming demonstrations will highlight the platform's capability to deliver innovative solutions for defense, border security, surveillance, emergency services, and mining sectors.
