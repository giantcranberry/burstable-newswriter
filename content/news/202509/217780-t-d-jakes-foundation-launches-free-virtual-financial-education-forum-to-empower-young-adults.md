<p>The T.D. Jakes Foundation has announced Life Forum 2025, a comprehensive virtual financial education program designed to address the growing financial pressures facing young adults. This initiative comes at a critical time when 36 states now require personal finance courses for graduation, a significant increase from just 21 states in 2020, yet many students still lack practical knowledge to effectively manage debt, build wealth, or plan for their financial futures.</p><p>Presented in partnership with Wells Fargo and Paul Quinn College, the forum carries the theme "Leveraging Income for Financial Empowerment" and will run through September, culminating with a main event on October 4. The program covers essential financial topics including budgeting, credit management, entrepreneurship, investing, and generational wealth building. All sessions will be available on-demand after the main event through the registration portal at <a href="https://life.vfairs.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://life.vfairs.com/</a>.</p><p>Kelley Cornish, President and CEO of the T.D. Jakes Foundation, emphasized that "financial literacy is about more than numbers, it is about access, confidence, and opportunity." Through Life Forum 2025, the foundation aims to bring together influential voices in financial education to demonstrate that young adults possess the tools and talent needed to take control of their financial futures and build lasting wealth.</p><p>The forum features prominent financial educators including Wallo267, who will join Chairman T.D. Jakes in exploring how cultural mindset shifts can transform financial struggles into opportunities. Milan Griffin, Executive Vice President of HomeFree-USA, will share strategies for building generational wealth through real estate, while New York Times bestselling author Tiffany "The Budgetnista" Aliche will demonstrate intentional budgeting techniques.</p><p>Rashad Bilal and Troy Millings, founders of Earn Your Leisure and InvestFest, will teach attendees how to leverage online platforms for income generation, and Teri Ijeoma of Trade and Travel will provide practical trading strategies for beginners. Egypt Sherrod will focus on asset acquisition, protection, and transfer strategies. Additional resources and information about the foundation's broader mission can be found at <a href="https://tdjfoundation.org/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://tdjfoundation.org/</a>.</p><p>Aligned with the Foundation's core pillar of Financial Inclusion, Life Forum 2025 provides culturally relevant education tailored to young adults navigating student debt, side hustles, career transitions, and economic uncertainty. Tozyea Reed, Vice President of Programming and Outcomes at the T.D. Jakes Foundation, emphasized that "LIFE is more than a program. It is a chance to discover how every dollar you earn can become a tool for freedom."</p><p>The virtual format ensures nationwide accessibility, allowing participants to engage with expert content regardless of their location. By making all sessions available on-demand, the foundation ensures that Life Forum 2025 will serve as a lasting resource for financial empowerment beyond the October 4 main event, potentially impacting financial literacy rates and economic mobility for generations to come.</p>
