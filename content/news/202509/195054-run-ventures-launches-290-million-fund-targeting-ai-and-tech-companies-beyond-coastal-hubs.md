<p>Run Ventures, a Salt Lake City-based venture capital firm founded by experienced investors Brandon Tidwell and Ben Dahl, has launched a $290 million early-stage fund dedicated to leading Series A investments in technology companies across high-growth ecosystems throughout the United States. The firm's strategy challenges traditional venture capital patterns by focusing on markets beyond the coastal hubs of Silicon Valley, New York, and Boston.</p><p>The fund represents a significant shift in venture capital distribution, targeting artificial intelligence and other transformative sectors in emerging tech centers such as Austin, Denver, and Atlanta. Tidwell and Dahl bring substantial experience from their previous work at Signal Peak Ventures, where they built a track record that includes successful investments in companies like Filevine, Authenticx, and Bark.</p><p>Tidwell emphasized the changing landscape of technology entrepreneurship, stating that the firm is witnessing a powerful convergence of talent, opportunity, and technology across the country's rising tech centers. He noted that artificial intelligence is accelerating company-building faster than ever before, creating new opportunities for entrepreneurs solving previously intractable problems.</p><p>The firm's investment philosophy centers on providing hands-on partnership and deep engagement with founders. Dahl compared their approach to running partners who encourage, coach, and push entrepreneurs forward throughout their journey. This methodology has already proven effective, as demonstrated by their previous collaboration with Filevine, where they helped the company raise subsequent rounds of capital and recruit key team members.</p><p>Ryan Anderson, co-founder and CEO of Filevine, attested to the firm's unique approach, noting that the Run Ventures team transcended the typical investor role to become essential collaborators during Filevine's accelerated growth. The firm's commitment extends beyond capital provision to include substantive expertise and strategic support precisely when entrepreneurs need it most.</p><p>With its base in Salt Lake City and strong national connectivity, Run Ventures is structured to identify and empower the next generation of entrepreneurs building outside traditional investment corridors. The firm's name reflects its core philosophy of helping founders go faster and further in their entrepreneurial journey, embodying a mindset of grit, momentum, and shared victories.
