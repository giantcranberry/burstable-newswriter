<p>Kwikset has announced an expanded lineup of connected home security products, including the company's first smart garage door opener and an enhanced smart lock with Apple Wallet integration. The new Kwikset FLEX Smart Garage Door Opener marks the company's entry into garage access, available in two models with remote operation capabilities through the Kwikset app or vehicle integration systems.</p><p>The FLEX 800 model features a three-quarter horsepower motor with LED lighting, while the FLEX 1000B offers a one-horsepower motor, brighter lighting, and built-in battery backup. Both models include quiet operation and Kwikset's patented anti-theft door release technology to prevent forced entry. Jeff Sandoval, director of electronics marketing at Kwikset, stated that the FLEX represents an important extension of their single-family electronics portfolio, complementing their existing connected products to deliver a complete residential access control solution.</p><p>Simultaneously, Kwikset is expanding its Halo portfolio with the Halo Select Plus smart lock, priced at $342, which features home key integration with Apple Wallet and Matter support. Homeowners can unlock doors with a simple tap of their iPhone or Apple Watch, while the lock also offers remote access via the Kwikset app, built-in Wi-Fi, and keyless entry with schedulable access codes. The device includes event logging, tamper alerts, and integrates with Amazon Alexa, Apple Home, and Google Home for voice commands and automations.</p><p>Kwikset is also introducing additional style variants of the original Halo Select line, including Contemporary and Soft Modern styles available through major retailers like <a href="https://www.amazon.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://www.lowes.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Lowe's</a>, and <a href="https://www.homedepot.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">The Home Depot</a>, priced at $298. These join the existing Transitional style, providing homeowners with more design options to match their home aesthetics while maintaining smart security features.</p><p>The Kwikset FLEX Smart Garage Door Opener will begin rolling out in select U.S. markets in mid-October, with nationwide availability expected in November. The Halo Select Plus and new Halo Select variants will be available through major retailers this fall, expanding Kwikset's presence in the connected home security market that continues to grow in both functionality and design flexibility.</p>
