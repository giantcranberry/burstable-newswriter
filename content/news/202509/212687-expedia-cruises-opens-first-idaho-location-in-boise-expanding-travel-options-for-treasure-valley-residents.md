<p>The Treasure Valley's travel landscape has expanded with the establishment of Idaho's first Expedia Cruises location at <a href="https://www.expediacruises.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.expediacruises.com</a>. This new franchise brings the resources of one of the world's most powerful travel brands to local residents seeking comprehensive vacation planning services.</p><p>Owned and operated by Mike and LesliAnn Hansen, longtime travel enthusiasts with deep community connections, the business represents a significant development for Idaho's travel industry. The Hansens bring extensive global experience to their venture, having spent several years living and traveling abroad with their family before returning to Boise last year. Their decision to open the state's first Expedia Cruises location was driven by the brand's trusted reputation and hybrid model that accommodates both online booking and personalized consultant services.</p><p>The Boise location will celebrate its grand opening on September 27 with a tailgate-themed event featuring refreshments, games, and exclusive travel offers. A highlight includes a special presentation by a Holland America Cruise Line representative at 1:00 PM, where attendees can learn about reduced deposits, onboard credits, and crew appreciation benefits through the Holland America Explorer Sale.</p><p>Currently staffed by 13 highly trained Vacation Consultants with plans for expansion, the Boise team reports Alaska as the most popular destination among clients, followed closely by European and Caribbean itineraries. As part of the <a href="https://www.expediagroup.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.expediagroup.com</a> family of brands, the location offers air, land, and sea vacation options including luxury travel, expedition cruises, river voyages, land tours, safaris, and all-inclusive resortsâ€”all at Expedia prices without additional fees.</p><p>The establishment of this franchise provides Idaho residents with access to professional travel consultation services through multiple channels, including in-person meetings, email, and phone support. This expansion into the Idaho market demonstrates the growing demand for comprehensive travel services in the region and offers local travelers the convenience of working with a globally recognized brand while maintaining personalized service from community-based experts.</p>
