<p>Signarama, the world's leading sign and graphics franchise, is intensifying its focus on artificial intelligence and emerging technologies to fundamentally transform how franchisees operate, compete, and expand their businesses. This strategic initiative comes as the company prepares to celebrate its 40th anniversary in 2026, reflecting a commitment to merging four decades of industry experience with next-generation business tools.</p><p>The company has implemented several technology-driven enhancements under its 2025 growth strategy, designed to provide franchisees with improved financial insight, operational efficiency, and customer targeting capabilities. A key development is the new financial benchmarking platform being developed in partnership with RevScale, which utilizes artificial intelligence to automatically collect, standardize, and analyze financial data. This system helps franchise owners better understand their performance metrics and identify specific opportunities for revenue growth and operational improvement.</p><p>Additionally, Signarama has deployed a custom-built customer relationship management platform that enables franchise owners to track sales pipelines, manage leads more effectively, and improve conversion rates with greater accuracy. The company is also expanding its use of data from the <a href="https://www.installmysigns.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Install My Signs</a> platform, providing franchisees with enhanced visibility into upcoming installation activity, particularly within the commercial real estate sector, allowing them to proactively pursue new client opportunities.</p><p>According to A.J. Titus, President of Signarama, the company's technology investments represent a strategic response to industry evolution. The technology rollout complements Signarama's existing investments in peer-to-peer learning and advanced training programs, including the P3 initiative and Masters Academy, which help franchisees implement best practices and adapt to changing customer needs. The company is also developing additional AI-driven capabilities, including automated design tools, smart inventory systems, and predictive marketing engines as part of its long-term transformation strategy.</p><p>This focus on innovation follows a record-setting year in 2024, during which Signarama signed 72 new franchise agreements and opened 15 new locations. With a goal of reaching 400 U.S. locations by year-end, the company, which is part of the United Franchise Group family of brands, is positioned to maintain its leadership position in a signage industry undergoing rapid technological transformation. The integration of artificial intelligence and advanced data analytics represents a significant shift in how sign businesses operate, potentially setting new industry standards for efficiency, customer targeting, and financial management.</p>
