<p>The Shell GameChanger Accelerator Powered by NREL has selected five startups for its seventh cohort, continuing its mission to advance emerging technologies with potential to transform the global energy landscape. Each selected company will receive $250,000 in nondilutive funding to collaborate with researchers at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, leveraging the lab's world-class facilities to accelerate technology development. This strategic partnership represents a significant step toward addressing critical challenges in sustainable energy production.</p><p>This year's cohort focuses on two strategic areas: future feedstocks and electrochemical pathways to fuels. The program aligns with Shell's Powering Progress strategy and NREL's mission to deliver integrated solutions for an affordable, secure energy future. The selected startups represent innovative approaches to converting waste materials and carbon dioxide into valuable fuels and chemicals, addressing both environmental concerns and energy security needs.</p><p>Two companies are working on future feedstocks, including Aquora Biosystems from Ann Arbor, Michigan, which develops next-generation organic waste biorefineries to produce biofuels like renewable natural gas and synthetic aviation fuel. The program will support transforming Aquora's wet organic waste into ketones for downstream SAF production. Consolidated Carbon from Austin, Texas produces industrial hemp-based materials to reduce atmospheric carbon dioxide without impacting food production, with GCxN assisting in optimizing pretreatment of hemp feedstocks.</p><p>Three companies are focused on electrochemical pathways to fuels. RenewCO2 from Somerset, New Jersey develops electrocatalytic conversion technology that transforms carbon dioxide into fuels and chemicals using only water and electricity. SKYRE from East Hartford, Connecticut uses advanced electrochemical processes to convert carbon dioxide into high-value fuels like methanol and synthetic gas. Sora Fuel from Cambridge, Massachusetts produces synthetic jet fuel by converting carbon dioxide from air using an efficient electrolyzer that avoids energy-intensive regeneration steps.</p><p>Johanna Jamison, GCxN program manager at NREL, stated that these companies are tackling complex challenges in waste and fuel production with creative approaches. The technical collaboration through GCxN helps de-risk emerging technologies and clear their path to scale and impact. Yesim Jonsson, Shell's GCxN program manager, emphasized that these innovations directly support Shell's ambition to become a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050. For more information about the program's impact and selection process, visit https://GCxNREL.com.</p><p>The seventh cohort brings GCxN's total portfolio to 28 startups, with portfolio companies having collectively raised more than $940 million and hired more than 486 people. The program demonstrates effectiveness in accelerating development and commercialization, with startups typically joining at Technology Readiness Level 4 and graduating at Level 6. This track record underscores the program's importance in bridging the gap between laboratory research and commercial deployment in the clean energy sector.</p>
