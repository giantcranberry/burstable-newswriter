<p>Metavesco, Inc. reported that its Epic Labor staffing subsidiary generated $167,115 in revenue during August 2025, representing an 87% increase from July's $89,458 revenue. While August included five weeks of operations compared to July's four weeks, the weekly performance showed substantial improvement, averaging $33,423 per week versus $22,365 in July.</p><p>CEO Ryan Schadel stated that Epic Labor continues to scale and is approaching cash flow positivity, which is crucial to the company's unique strategy of converting operating cash flow into digital assets including Bitcoin, Bitcoin miners, and Ethereum. This approach differs from other digital asset treasury strategies that rely on stock issuance to acquire cryptocurrency, potentially avoiding shareholder dilution through operational cash flow rather than equity issuance.</p><p>Epic Labor currently operates four staffing locations specializing in on-demand blue-collar staffing across construction, warehousing, hospitality, and events sectors. The company plans to continue expanding its footprint throughout the Southeast with additional branch locations scheduled to open soon. More information about the company's performance and strategy can be found in their filings available at <a href="https://www.otcmarkets.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.otcmarkets.com</a>.</p><p>The revenue growth demonstrates meaningful progress toward building sustainable businesses that can acquire digital assets with what the company describes as asymmetrical upside potential. For business leaders monitoring alternative corporate treasury strategies, Metavesco's operational approach represents an innovative model that leverages traditional business cash flow to gain exposure to digital assets without diluting existing shareholders through secondary offerings.</p><p>This development signals a growing trend where established companies are using operational businesses to fund digital asset acquisitions rather than relying solely on capital markets. The staffing industry's consistent cash flow characteristics make it particularly suitable for this strategy, potentially providing a template for other companies seeking cryptocurrency exposure while maintaining operational fundamentals.</p>
