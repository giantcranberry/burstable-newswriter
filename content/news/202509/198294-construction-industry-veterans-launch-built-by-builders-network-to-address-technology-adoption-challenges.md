<p>Steve Dell'Orto, founder and CEO of ConCntric, has launched the Built by Builders network, a collaborative initiative of construction technology companies founded by individuals with substantial experience in architecture, engineering, or construction. The network addresses the construction industry's persistent challenge with technology adoption by ensuring solutions are developed by those who understand the field's practical realities.</p><p>Dell'Orto, who spent 26 years in construction leading major projects including the Golden State Warriors' Chase Center and Salesforce Tower, observed that many existing tools were created without proper understanding of construction's day-to-day operations. The network emerged from customer feedback indicating greater trust in solutions built by people who have experienced the same challenges firsthand.</p><p>The founding membership includes eight companies addressing different construction pain points: <a href="https://clearstory.io" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Clearstory</a> for change order management, ConCntric for AI-powered preconstruction management, <a href="https://documentcrunch.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Document Crunch</a> for AI risk reduction, Kaster for payroll and compliance, PLOT for worksite procurement and delivery logistics, ProjectMark for construction CRM and marketing, SALUS for safety management, and <a href="https://togal.ai" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Togal.AI</a> for AI-powered estimating. Each member brings deep construction roots and domain expertise covering the entire project lifecycle from planning to delivery.</p><p>The network elevates industry technology discussions through webinars, shared resources, and industry events, focusing on topics including AI implementation, compliance, and knowledge transfer as approximately one-third of the construction workforce approaches retirement. With members operating across North America and internationally, the network shares globally relevant lessons and solutions that move beyond hype to deliver measurable productivity gains and standardized workflows.</p><p>Built by Builders fosters connections through member-hosted webinars, open conversations, and networking events at industry conferences. The network plans to expand educational offerings in 2025 with more topic-specific webinars and thought leadership on AI, workforce development, and sustainability while developing their Medium blog into a central resource hub. Membership applications open annually, with the 2025 window recently closed and the 2026 window scheduled for next year.</p><p>The network requires members to have substantial AEC industry experience, collaborative spirit, and commitment to improving the built environment. This focus on field-tested expertise aims to drive technology adoption and create a more sustainable, efficient future for the construction industry through practical, high-impact solutions developed by those who understand construction's real-world challenges.</p>
