<p>Nightfood Holdings Inc. has completed a $31 million share exchange agreement to acquire Victorville Treasure Holdings, LLC, owner of a 155-room Holiday Inn property in Victorville, California. This transaction represents the company's inaugural hotel acquisition and establishes the Victorville location as its dedicated Robotics-as-a-Service innovation site for testing and deploying artificial intelligence-driven automation solutions.</p><p>The acquisition signifies a major advancement in Nightfood's strategic initiative to revolutionize hotel operations through AI-powered robotics. Initial automation implementations, including Skytech's Laundry Helper robot, are already operational at the property. Subsequent deployment phases will expand automation across housekeeping, foodservice, and front-of-house functions to develop a scalable Smart Hotel model targeting labor-intensive, repetitive, and injury-prone tasks that are increasingly challenging to staff with human workers.</p><p>CEO Jimmy Chan emphasized that this acquisition provides the foundational infrastructure for Nightfood's next-generation hospitality platform, positioning the company at the vanguard of AI-driven hotel operations. The company's vertically integrated strategy combines robotics innovation with real estate ownership, utilizing acquired properties as live deployment sites for testing and operational benchmarking purposes.</p><p>Nightfood's Robotics-as-a-Service platform targets the rapidly expanding global service robotics industry, which industry forecasts project to exceed <a href="https://ibn.fm/pn7vh" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">$170 billion by 2030</a>. The company's long-term vision extends beyond hospitality into additional verticals requiring similar automation solutions, delivering scalable robotics that enhance safety, efficiency, and reliability across multiple sectors.</p><p>This strategic development occurs as the hospitality industry confronts persistent challenges with staffing shortages and operational inefficiencies. Nightfood's approach reflects the growing trend toward automation in service industries, where AI and robotics are increasingly deployed to manage tasks that prove difficult to fill with human labor.
