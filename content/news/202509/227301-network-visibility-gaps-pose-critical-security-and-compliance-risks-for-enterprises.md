<p>Enterprise networks have become increasingly fragmented across on-premises infrastructure, multiple clouds, and third-party services, creating significant visibility gaps that pose security risks and operational challenges. According to Pavel Bykov, co-founder and CEO of IP Fabric, most organizations still rely on patchwork point solutions that fail to provide complete, unified views of network behavior. This leads to blind spots from unmanaged devices, unknown dependencies, and misconfigurations that can compromise security posture.</p><p>Bykov emphasizes that visibility and automation have evolved from secondary considerations to foundational requirements for modern network management. When IP Fabric began operations in 2016, many organizations planned to automate only after gaining control, but Bykov argues that without visibility and automation, control remains elusive as complexity grows. The conversation has shifted significantly, with recognition that visibility supports not just network teams but also security, compliance, and digital transformation goals across the business.</p><p>The challenge of balancing compliance with operational excellence represents a critical pressure point for CIOs. Bykov advises embedding compliance into daily operations through automation rather than treating audits as isolated events. Platforms like IP Fabric automate evidence collection, validate configurations against policies, and generate audit-ready reports, making compliance a continuous outcome of network operations. This approach is particularly relevant as compliance frameworks like NIST, ISO 27001, DORA, and NIS2 raise regulatory requirements.</p><p>Achieving network control remains difficult due to fragmented management across different technologies, clouds, and regions. Bykov notes that when visibility is lost, organizations cannot enforce policies, detect anomalies, or confidently make changes. The accountability for network performance and security ultimately rests with the organization, not cloud providers or vendors. IP Fabric addresses this by building network representations from actual state rather than documented designs, providing dynamic, time-stamped snapshots for validating security policies and gauging network health.</p><p>Visibility gaps present substantial risks, with unmanaged or unknown devices discovered in nearly every proof of concept IP Fabric conducts. These assets can bypass security policies, introduce vulnerabilities, or become failure points. Lack of path mapping creates additional risks, resulting in unexpected paths and firewall bypass scenarios, particularly with transparent firewall deployments. Many tools focus on policy deployment but fail to consider actual traffic paths, making breach detection and misconfiguration identification challenging.</p><p>For enterprises preparing for audits, Bykov recommends digital twin technology as the most effective approach. Manual audits prove expensive, time-consuming, and disruptive, while automated compliance validation integrated into operational processes keeps organizations audit-ready. IP Fabric continuously collects, models, and validates network data against compliance policies, generating necessary reports in minutes rather than the weeks or months required for manual processes.</p><p>Future-proofing network environments requires acknowledging that network state serves as the only authoritative source of truth. As networks grow more complex, the challenge involves managing new technology within existing contexts rather than simply deploying additional solutions. Bykov emphasizes building complete, accurate network views as foundations for driving automation, analytics, and collaboration as operations, security, and compliance goals continue converging across enterprise technology landscapes.</p>
