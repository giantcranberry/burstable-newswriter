<p>Kotobuki Seating International has completed a comprehensive seating redesign for The Delacorte Theater in Central Park as part of an $85 million revitalization project for The Public Theater's Free Shakespeare in the Park venue. The collaboration with <a href="https://ennead.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Ennead Architects</a> and Fisher Dachs Associates Theater Planning and Design resulted in 1,864 new seats that represent a significant advancement in outdoor theater seating technology and inclusive design principles.</p><p>The seating system addresses multiple challenges unique to the open-air cultural landmark while supporting the theater's mission of free and equitable access to performing arts. Sixteen custom-engineered 27-inch XL seats were seamlessly integrated into the overall design, providing accommodation for patrons of all sizes without visual distinction from standard seating. This approach represents a departure from traditional accessible seating that often segregates or highlights differences among audience members.</p><p>Technical innovations include the adaptation of Kotobuki's AURA Chair with custom quiet-rise functionality specifically designed for outdoor use. This development minimizes noise disruption during performances while maintaining the intimacy and acoustic quality essential to live theater. The seats, manufactured in the United States, feature ergonomic refinements engineered to withstand Central Park's seasonal weather extremes, replacing outdated 18-inch seats with wider 19- to 22-inch options for enhanced comfort.</p><p>Accessibility improvements form a cornerstone of the redesign, with ADA-accessible seating more than doubling to 34 positions throughout the theater. Each seat incorporates custom-sized donor plaques with improved legibility, honoring philanthropic supporters while maintaining aesthetic consistency. The seating upgrades complement other renovation elements including Ennead's fa√ßade crafted from reclaimed redwood water towers, rebuilt lighting towers, and expanded backstage facilities.</p><p>Keiko Fukasawa Sutton, CEO of Kotobuki, emphasized the architectural significance of the seating system, noting that seating functions as an integral component of spatial and cultural experience rather than mere furniture. The company's approach required balancing technical precision with design sensitivity to create a system that embodies inclusivity, comfort, and longevity. Fisher Dachs Associates Principal Cathleen Bachman described the XL seating as setting a new standard for outdoor venues, while Public Theater Executive Director Patrick Willingham highlighted how the redesign supports the institution's mission of free theater accessibility for all New Yorkers.</p><p>The renovated Delacorte Theater reopened in July 2025 with a production of Twelfth Night directed by Saheem Ali, marking the beginning of a new chapter for the 63-year-old venue. The seating system represents one of the most visible improvements for audiences, serving as a benchmark for future outdoor performance venue designs that prioritize both spectator comfort and equitable access to cultural programming.</p>
