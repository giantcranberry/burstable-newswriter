<p>ERZIA has launched a new line of Commercial-Off-The-Shelf RF microwave amplifiers specifically engineered for New Space missions, responding to industry demands for faster delivery and cost efficiency without performance compromise. The current lineup includes 13 new COTS RF amplifiers designed for satellite and payload manufacturers, SmallSat developers, and commercial space integrators operating in LEO, MEO, and CIS-Lunar orbits.</p><p>Each amplifier delivers best-in-class RF performance while incorporating enhancements that make it flight-ready for next-generation missions. The New Space COTS line has been engineered to meet the toughest mission demands, featuring radiation-tolerant circuitry valid up to 30 Krad and 32 MeV for proven resilience in space environments. Each unit is built with vacuum-compatible housings and integrated depressurization structures to withstand rapid decompression, while outgassing-compliant materials ensure compliance with mission standards.</p><p>Leveraging automotive-grade components, the products are prepared for rigorous thermal, vibration and acceleration environments. Every delivery includes by default a complete Acceptance Test Report at three temperatures with the option for additional screening upon request. The product line includes both high-power amplifiers and low-noise amplifiers covering a broad frequency range, with applications spanning communications payloads, navigation, telemetry, radar, and tracking & command systems.</p><p>David Diez, ERZIA's Managing Director, stated that New Space programs move fast with intense cost pressure, and the company created this product line to give commercial satellite builders immediate access to flight-ready RF hardware engineered from the ground up for New Space demands. The ERZIA New Space launch will be officially unveiled at European Microwave Week 2025 in Utrecht, with technical specifications available at <a href="https://www.erzia.com/newspace" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.erzia.com/newspace</a>.</p><p>This development represents a significant advancement for the commercial space industry, potentially accelerating satellite deployment timelines while reducing costs. The availability of reliable, radiation-hardened COTS components addresses a critical bottleneck in New Space development, enabling faster innovation and more competitive pricing for satellite communications, Earth observation, and other space-based services. The technology could have broad implications for global connectivity, scientific research, and commercial space ventures seeking to leverage standardized, high-performance components.</p>
