<p>T. Rowe Price Investment Management has committed to purchasing $75 million worth of shares in Neptune Insurance Holdings' initial public offering, positioning the Baltimore-based investment firm as a cornerstone investor alongside Alliance Bernstein, which has made an identical commitment. The St. Petersburg-based flood insurer expects to price its shares between $18 and $20 per share, potentially valuing the company at $2.76 billion at the upper end of the range.</p><p>The Neptune IPO represents a significant milestone for the private flood insurance sector, with only existing shareholders selling shares totaling 18.4 million shares for gross proceeds of up to $368 million. Selling stockholders include Neptune co-founder Jim Albert, private equity firms Bregal Sagemount and FTV Capital. CEO Trevor Burgess, who acquired a controlling stake in 2018 and assumed leadership in early 2019, will maintain voting power over 80% following the public offering.</p><p>Neptune's journey to public markets follows modest early funding rounds totaling $12.6 million over three rounds, with its largest being a $10 million Series A round in March 2023. Under Burgess's leadership, the company has expanded through strategic acquisitions including Jumpstart, a parametric insurance company purchased in 2021, and Charles River Data in 2024 to enhance in-house data science, AI and machine learning capabilities. The company has applied to list on the NYSE under the symbol "NP."</p><p>The investment comes as T. Rowe Price continues to expand its portfolio across emerging technologies and financial services. Earlier in September, the firm participated in a $1 billion Series E round for <a href="https://psiquantum.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PsiQuantum</a>, a quantum photonic chip developer. Other recent portfolio investments include Galvanize Therapeutics, AI startup Anthropic, and defense firm Anduril Industries. The firm's strategic partnership with Goldman Sachs, announced earlier this year, involves Goldman investing up to $1 billion in T. Rowe Price stock with a goal of owning up to 3.5% of the fund giant.</p><p>Neptune has established itself as the largest private flood insurance provider in the United States, operating in all 50 states and the District of Columbia with AM Best-rated insurance partners. The company has insured property valued in excess of $100 billion, serving more than 235,000 customers. Financial performance has been strong, with Neptune reporting $119.3 million in revenue and $34.6 million in net income for 2024. The company has secured $400 million in premium capacity for 2025, up from $300 million in 2024, supported by more than 30 global reinsurance and specialty market partners.</p><p>T. Rowe Price's substantial investment in Neptune's IPO underscores institutional confidence in the growing private flood insurance market, particularly as climate-related risks increase demand for specialized coverage solutions. With $1.7 trillion in assets under management as of July 31 and over 300 portfolio investments, T. Rowe Price's participation signals market validation for Neptune's business model and growth trajectory in the evolving insurance landscape.</p>
