<p>The Supervisory Board of Amprion GmbH has appointed Katrin Hilmer as Chief Operating Officer and Director of Labor Relations, effective April 1, 2026. This strategic expansion of the transmission system operator's leadership team comes as Amprion's responsibility for Germany's energy system transformation continues to grow, with the company experiencing an average 13 percent employee growth over the past five years.</p><p>Hilmer, currently Managing Director of DB Energie GmbH, will assume responsibility for human resources, operations, occupational safety, and European affairs. She joins the existing management team consisting of Dr. Christoph Müller (CEO), Dr. Hendrik Neumann (CTO), and Peter Rüth (CFO). Uwe Tigges, Chairman of the Supervisory Board, emphasized that Hilmer's appointment underscores the company's commitment to increasing female representation in executive positions throughout the organization.</p><p>The energy transition represents a critical generational project requiring robust infrastructure development, a challenge Hilmer expressed enthusiasm for addressing in her new role. Her background includes extensive international experience in the USA, Spain, and France, along with various management positions within DB Group and DB InfraGO AG. Since 2022, she has led DB Energie GmbH with responsibility for human resources and security operations.</p><p>Amprion's operational significance extends across Germany's energy landscape, operating one of four transmission system networks with 11,000 kilometers of extra-high voltage grid connecting the North Sea to the Alps. The company's infrastructure supports one-third of Germany's economic output and serves 29 million people while employing over 3,100 workers across more than 30 locations. Additional information about the company's operations and infrastructure projects can be found at <a href="https://www.amprion.net" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.amprion.net</a>.</p><p>This leadership expansion occurs as Germany accelerates its transition toward climate-neutral energy systems, requiring substantial grid expansion and modernization. The appointment reflects the increasing complexity of managing Europe's interconnected energy networks while maintaining grid stability and security during the renewable energy transition. For business and technology leaders, this development signals the critical importance of operational expertise and diverse leadership in managing the complex infrastructure requirements of the energy transition, with implications for grid reliability, workforce development, and the broader European energy market stability.</p>
