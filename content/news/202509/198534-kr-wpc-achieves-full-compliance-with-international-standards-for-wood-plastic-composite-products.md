<p>KR New Materials Co., Ltd. (KR WPC) has confirmed that its comprehensive wood-plastic composite product lineup meets all major international standards across Europe, the United States, and Southeast Asia. The company's products, backed by ISO 9001, CE, and FSC certifications, have undergone rigorous independent testing that demonstrates superior performance in safety, durability, and environmental sustainability.</p><p>In European markets, KR WPC products comply with EN 15534 standards, exhibiting exceptional water resistance with only 0.5% thickness swelling and 0.1% swelling in width and length after 28 days of water immersion. The products achieved EN 13501-1 Class Bfl-S1 fire safety rating, demonstrating superior flame retardancy, while maintaining structural integrity with Brinell hardness averaging 104 MPa and elastic recovery of 74%.</p><p>For the United States market, the products meet ASTM standards including D7031, D7032, and D6109. Testing revealed flexural strength of 39.3 MPa with modulus of elasticity reaching 4168 MPa under standard conditions. Extreme temperature performance showed MOR of 30.3 MPa and MOE of 3145 MPa at 50°C, while at –29°C, MOR reached 55.2 MPa and MOE 7306 MPa. UV resistance was rated Grey Scale 4, ensuring maintained appearance under prolonged sun exposure.</p><p>Southeast Asian markets benefit from products specifically engineered for tropical conditions, featuring average density of 1.317 g/cm³, excellent dimensional stability, and superior resistance to UV exposure, humidity, and insect attack. This makes the products particularly suitable for markets in Indonesia, Thailand, the Philippines, and other high-temperature, high-humidity regions.</p><p>The company's manufacturing process utilizes wood fiber, high-density polyethylene plastic, and advanced chemical additives, with production occurring across 40 production lines featuring in-house mold design capabilities with over 340 mold types. This enables both standard and fully customized solutions for global customers. Products are shipped to more than 24 countries worldwide, complying with regional ASEAN standards and combining ISO, ASTM, EN, and local regulations such as BCA Singapore and TIS Thailand.</p><p>According to company spokesperson Carol, the products have been tested and proven to perform under the most demanding international benchmarks, providing consistent reliability for global customers. The company further supports its products with customization options and 25-year warranties, reinforcing its commitment to long-term customer satisfaction.
