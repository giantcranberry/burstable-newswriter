<p>KBS Real Estate Investment Trust III has completed the strategic sale of Park Place Village, a 484,980-square-foot Class A mixed-use property in Leawood, Kansas, to DFW Land, a real estate development company specializing in Dallas-Fort Worth area acquisitions. The transaction represents a significant exit for KBS, which acquired the property in 2015 and maintained 100% occupancy despite challenging market conditions, showcasing the company's ability to identify improving submarkets early and reposition assets for long-term performance.</p><p>Marc DeLuca, KBS CEO and regional president for the Eastern U.S., emphasized that proactive management and curated retail experiences enhanced the overall office offering, allowing KBS to strategically exit the property at full occupancy while navigating post-pandemic market challenges. The property's consistent cash flow during a period when many office assets have struggled underscores the success of KBS's management approach and the resilience of well-positioned mixed-use developments.</p><p>Park Place Village consists of 10 buildings developed between 2007 and 2013, featuring a mix of office and retail space in Kansas City's South Johnson County submarket. The property offers numerous amenities including boutique shops, upscale restaurants, a fitness center, EV charging stations, and a rooftop view terrace. Ryan Pires, asset manager for Park Place Village and senior vice president of asset management for KBS, highlighted how active management transformed the property into one of Leawood's most popular mixed-use destinations by creating a vibrant retail experience that elevated tenant engagement and long-term relevance.</p><p>Vijay Borra, CEO of DFW Land, described the acquisition as a natural addition to his company's portfolio, noting the asset's strong positioning for long-term performance. The transaction aligns with DFW Land's recent acquisition strategy, having successfully acquired several million square-feet of office and retail space over the past 90 days. This acquisition occurs during positive trends in the Kansas City office market, where <a href="https://www.newmark.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Newmark</a> reports 1.1 million square feet of net absorption over the past four quarters.</p><p>The sale was facilitated by Newmark Capital Markets teams from Chicago and Dallas, led by Derek Fohl and Gary Carr. Fohl, senior managing director at Newmark, anticipates continued investor interest in mixed-use assets like Park Place Village as both office and retail markets recover. Legal representation for KBS was provided by <a href="https://www.gtlaw.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Greenberg Traurig</a> attorneys Bruce Fischer and Howard Chu, with Fischer noting that the successful exit underscores the resilience of KBS's vision for the property and South Johnson County's growth.</p><p>The property's location at 11500 Ash Street positions it within an affluent neighborhood featuring shopping, entertainment venues, and residential components including 201 apartments and 30 townhouses. This transaction signals growing confidence in mixed-use properties that combine office, retail, and residential elements, particularly in suburban markets showing strong recovery signals. For business leaders and investors, the successful sale demonstrates the importance of strategic asset management and the potential for mixed-use properties to maintain value even during market disruptions.</p>
