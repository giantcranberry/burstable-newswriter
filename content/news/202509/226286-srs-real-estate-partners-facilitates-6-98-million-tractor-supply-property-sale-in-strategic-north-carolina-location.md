<p>SRS Real Estate Partners has finalized the $6.98 million sale of a 21,930-square-foot property occupied by Tractor Supply in Castle Hayne, North Carolina. The transaction involved a newly developed property situated on 11.5 acres at 3400 Castle Hayne Road, featuring 14 years remaining on its corporate-guaranteed lease at the time of sale.</p><p>Calvin Short, Executive Vice President & Managing Principal of SRS Capital Markets, represented the seller, a Pinehurst-based developer. The buyer, a Conyers, Georgia-based private investor completing the second leg of a 1031 exchange, was represented by Pierce Mayson with Matthews REIS.
