<p>GeoVax Labs, Inc. has entered into a securities purchase agreement with healthcare-focused institutional investors for a registered direct offering expected to generate approximately $2.5 million in gross proceeds. The clinical-stage biotechnology company will sell 3,968,256 shares of common stock and warrants to purchase up to 11,904,768 additional shares at a combined price of $0.63 per unit. The warrants carry the same exercise price and will become exercisable upon shareholder approval, expiring five years from that date.</p><p>The company plans to use the net proceeds to advance its product candidates through research and development, manufacturing, clinical studies, and working capital requirements. Roth Capital Partners is serving as sole placement agent for the offering, which is expected to close on September 30, 2025, subject to customary closing conditions. The offering is being conducted under a shelf registration statement previously filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and declared effective on March 14, 2024. Electronic copies of the final prospectus supplement and accompanying prospectus may be obtained from the SEC's website at <a href="https://www.sec.gov" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.sec.gov</a>.</p><p>GeoVax's lead clinical program involves GEO-CM04S1, a next-generation COVID-19 vaccine currently in three Phase 2 clinical trials. The vaccine is being evaluated as a primary vaccine for immunocompromised patients, including those with hematologic cancers, and as a booster for patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia and healthy individuals who previously received mRNA vaccines. This targeted approach addresses critical gaps in current COVID-19 protection, particularly for vulnerable populations who may not respond adequately to existing vaccines.</p><p>In oncology, the company's lead program features GedeptinÂ®, a novel oncolytic solid tumor gene-directed therapy that recently completed a multicenter Phase 1/2 clinical trial for advanced head and neck cancers. The successful completion of this trial represents a significant milestone in developing innovative cancer treatments that could offer new options for patients with limited therapeutic alternatives.</p><p>The company is also developing a vaccine targeting Mpox and smallpox and, based on recent regulatory guidance from the European Medicines Agency, anticipates progressing directly to Phase 3 clinical evaluation without conducting Phase 1 and Phase 2 trials. This regulatory pathway acceleration could significantly shorten development timelines and reduce costs for the Mpox vaccine program. For additional information about the company's clinical trials and updates, visit their website at <a href="https://www.geovax.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.geovax.com</a>.</p><p>The capital infusion comes at a critical juncture for GeoVax as it advances multiple clinical programs simultaneously. The funding will support the company through key development milestones across its vaccine and oncology portfolios. For investors and industry observers, this financing round demonstrates continued institutional confidence in GeoVax's technology platform and development strategy despite challenging market conditions for biotech companies.</p><p>The progression of GEO-CM04S1 through Phase 2 trials represents an important development in the COVID-19 vaccine landscape, particularly as the world transitions to endemic management of the virus. The focus on immunocompromised populations addresses a significant unmet medical need and could position GeoVax as a key player in specialized vaccine markets. Similarly, the accelerated regulatory pathway for the Mpox vaccine highlights the growing recognition of novel vaccine platforms and their potential to address emerging infectious disease threats more efficiently than traditional development approaches.</p>
