<p>The IHG Owners Association, representing franchisees of IHG Hotels & Resorts globally, has appointed Steve Sickel as Chief Executive Officer effective November 24. Sickel succeeds John Muehlbauer, who will retire at the end of 2025 after five years as CEO and a 30-year hospitality career that delivered tens of millions in value to owners through initiatives including loyalty program enhancements and fee reductions.</p><p>Sickel brings extensive hospitality sector experience from his 13 years with IHG, where he served as Global Head of Revenue Delivery leading strategy across key commercial drivers including IHG One Rewards, Distribution Marketing, Digital Marketing, Pricing and Revenue Management. His background includes CEO roles at RoomKey, where he designed strategies to lower third-party distribution costs, and most recently as Partner & Chief Marketing Officer at The Mallet Group, a global loyalty marketing consultancy.</p><p>Recognized by HSMAI as one of the Top 25 Extraordinary Minds in Hospitality, Sickel's appointment signals the Association's commitment to continued value creation for its members. The selection process involved a CEO search committee of owner volunteers partnering with hospitality talent firm Bristol Associates, culminating in Sickel's appointment based on his proven track record in multi-function global organizations.</p><p>Mark Zipperer, 2025 Chair of the Association's Global Board of Directors, noted that Sickel's deep IHG knowledge and collaborative problem-solving reputation make him ideal for the role during this important industry period. Sickel emphasized his focus on strengthening relationships with IHG hotel owners and leadership, developing win-win solutions that improve long-term member value, and harnessing the collective voice to drive impact with IHG and the broader hospitality industry.</p><p>The IHG Owners Association, originally established by Holiday Inn founder Kemmons Wilson in 1955, represents over 5,000 owners worldwide and advocates on operational standards and industry issues. Additional information about the organization is available at <a href="https://www.owners.org" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.owners.org</a>.</p><p>This leadership transition comes at a critical time for the hospitality industry, as franchise owners face increasing pressure from rising operational costs and competitive market dynamics. Sickel's expertise in revenue optimization and distribution cost reduction positions him to address these challenges directly, potentially leading to improved profitability for IHG franchisees worldwide. His background in loyalty marketing suggests a continued focus on enhancing the IHG One Rewards program, which could strengthen competitive positioning against other major hotel chains.</p><p>The appointment reflects the growing importance of franchisee representation in the hotel industry, where owner associations play a crucial role in negotiating favorable terms with parent companies and advocating for policies that support sustainable business growth. As the industry continues to recover from pandemic-related disruptions and adapts to changing traveler preferences, strong leadership in owner associations becomes increasingly vital for ensuring franchisee interests are protected and promoted.</p>
