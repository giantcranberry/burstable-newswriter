<p>Octopus Energy Group has announced the spin-off of its technology company Kraken, a strategic move designed to accelerate the platform's global expansion and drive innovation in the utility sector. The AI-powered platform, which processes 15 billion new data points daily, is currently contracted to serve over 70 million household and business accounts worldwide, making it the most advanced data-driven operating system for utilities.</p><p>The spin-off represents a significant milestone for Kraken, enabling the company to fast-track technology investments, expand into new energy markets and regions, and build on its utility foundations while maintaining structural clarity for customers, investors, and partners. This independence comes as Kraken reaches $500 million in committed annual revenue through licensing agreements with major energy companies including EDF, E.ON Next, National Grid US, Origin Energy, Plenitude, and Tokyo Gasâ€”quadrupling its contracted revenue in just three years.</p><p>Greg Jackson, Founder of Octopus Energy Group, stated that Kraken was created as a global platform to transform utilities and deliver the innovation, service, and value customers deserve. He expressed pride in the business's success and set ambitious goals for the future, suggesting that Kraken could serve a billion people over the next decade. Amir Orad, CEO of Kraken, emphasized that the spin-off provides more freedom to invest, expand, and serve utility clients equally while continuing to push innovation in cloud technology, utility-grade AI, and energy data management.</p><p>Kraken's technology has been instrumental in transforming utilities worldwide by reducing operational costs, improving customer service, and increasing flexibility and innovation. Recent achievements include developing breakthrough solutions for commercial and industrial customers, signing its first fully integrated US utility client with National Grid, and scaling up its utility-grade AI capabilities. The company also leads in residential flexibility, managing over 2GW of power from electric vehicles, home batteries, and heat pumps to balance the grid and reduce energy costs for consumers.</p><p>To support this next growth phase, Kraken has appointed Tim Wan as its new Chief Financial Officer. Wan brings experience from US software leader Asana, where he played a key role in its successful public listing and financial growth. The spin-off positions Kraken to further its mission of accelerating the energy transition and positively impacting people worldwide through technological innovation and expanded global reach.</p>
