<p>Dot Ai has secured $1.27 million in new orders for its hardware platform, prompting the expansion of its Puerto Rico manufacturing operations. The IoT and AI-based SaaS company is adding a second shift at its Barceloneta facility and installing additional capital equipment to meet current and forecasted demand for its industrial-grade smart asset tags and patent-pending Zero Infrastructure Mesh Bridge.</p><p>CEO Ed Nabrotzky stated that these orders validate the company's long-term vision of transforming how organizations manage assets through AI-enabled solutions. The expansion represents the first step in Dot Ai's broader manufacturing strategy, with plans to scale production across additional geographies over time. The Puerto Rico facility, which began production earlier this year, serves as the company's central manufacturing hub and has already created several full-time, highly skilled positions.</p><p>The new orders span multiple industry sectors where Dot Ai's solutions are gaining traction, including logistics and manufacturing. The diverse order base reflects the broad applicability of the company's Asset Intelligence platform, which provides in-process asset visibility and predictive intelligence that integrates with existing infrastructure. These solutions enable organizations to increase revenue, improve customer experience, enhance security, and reduce operational risk.</p><p>The Puerto Rico expansion aligns with Dot Ai's commitment to advancing high-tech manufacturing while leveraging the island's skilled workforce, strategic location, and favorable business environment. This approach enhances the company's ability to serve both U.S. and global markets effectively.
