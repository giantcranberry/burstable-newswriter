<p>ProtoSpace Mfg. announced the launch of ProtoSpace Designer, a new online software tool designed to help mechanical engineers in aerospace, defense, and other advanced industries create and order custom machined parts with enhanced speed and simplicity. The software integrates directly with ProtoSpace Mfg.'s rapid machining processes, embedding manufacturability constraints into the design environment to eliminate traditional barriers between design and production.</p><p>Users of ProtoSpace Designer can design parts with built-in manufacturability checks, obtain instant and accurate price quotes, place orders seamlessly online, and receive finished parts in as little as two to three days. Dr. Doug Milburn, President of ProtoSpace Mfg., emphasized that traditional CAD platforms like SolidWorks offer flexibility but often introduce friction through delayed quotes and late-stage manufacturability issues, whereas ProtoSpace Designer removes these bottlenecks to keep innovation flowing efficiently.</p><p>The software is accessible worldwide at <a href="https://protospacedesigner.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://protospacedesigner.com</a>, with parts manufactured at ProtoSpace Mfg.'s facilities in Nova Scotia, Canada, and North Carolina, USA. By providing instant pricing, manufacturability assurance, and rapid turnaround, the tool enables engineers to innovate faster with confidence that their designs are production-ready, ultimately accelerating technology development cycles, reducing downtime, and minimizing costly redesigns.</p><p>ProtoSpace Designer shares underlying technology with Protocase Designer, which also supports machined part design, but is tailored with naming conventions specific to aerospace workflows for clarity and ease of use. This unified platform aims to support rapid design and ordering processes, reinforcing ProtoSpace Mfg.'s role as a fast aerospace supplier focused on efficiency and reliability in prototype and technology development.</p>
