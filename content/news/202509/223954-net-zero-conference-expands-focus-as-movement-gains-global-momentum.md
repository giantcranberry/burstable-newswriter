<p>The Net Zero Conference prepares for its 12th annual event on October 1, 2025, at the Los Angeles Convention Center, marking significant evolution from its origins as an educational event focused solely on net zero building design. Drew Shula, founder and CEO of Verdical Group, emphasizes how the conference has expanded into a comprehensive movement addressing multiple environmental sectors as the net zero concept has gained mainstream recognition.</p><p>When the conference launched initially, net zero design represented a novel concept even for industry leaders, with several hundred sustainability professionals attending the first event. The conference has since broadened beyond the building industry to include content on Biomimicry, Biophilia, Built Environment, Design, Energy, Health & Wellness, Materials, Technology, Transportation, Urbanism, Waste, and Water. This expansion reflects the growing understanding that environmental solutions require interdisciplinary approaches.</p><p>Verdical Group, the consulting firm behind the conference, specializes in decarbonizing the built environment and works with major organizations including NASA, Google, Johnson & Johnson, LAX, Meta, and Apple. The firm operates as a Benefit Corporation in California and maintains third-party certification as a high-scoring B Corporation, meeting rigorous standards of social and environmental performance. As a <a href="https://www.onepercentfortheplanet.org" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">1% for the Planet Member Company</a>, Verdical Group donates 1% of its annual revenue to environmental nonprofit organizations.</p><p>Shula's recent attendance at a TED Countdown event in Nairobi, Kenya reinforced his perspective on climate change as a global issue requiring coordinated action. During periods of political uncertainty that can discourage climate advocates, such international gatherings serve as reminders that individual efforts worldwide collectively create significant impact. This global perspective informs the conference's approach to addressing environmental challenges.</p><p>The 2025 conference will feature keynotes from Joel Cesare (Growth Lead, Cambio), Leah Thomas (Environmentalist), Nalleli Cobo (Environmental Activist), and Michael Ford (The Hip Hop Architecture Camp). The event convenes climate leaders to collaborate on global solutions for change in the built environment, serving as a hub for industry professionals to gather, bridge knowledge gaps, and inspire a net zero future. The conference includes educational sessions, an expo hall featuring decarbonization technologies, and the Trailblazer Awards Ceremony celebrating interdisciplinary leaders making positive environmental impacts.</p><p>Shula believes the conference's timing proves increasingly relevant as the net zero movement expands beyond individual buildings to encompass businesses, states, countries, and global systems. The conference represents an opportunity to advocate for building a net zero future for everyone, demonstrating how localized actions contribute to global environmental solutions. This approach acknowledges that meaningful climate action requires engagement across multiple sectors and scales of operation.</p><p>The evolution of the Net Zero Conference reflects broader industry trends toward comprehensive sustainability strategies. As businesses and governments increasingly commit to net zero targets, events like this provide crucial platforms for knowledge sharing, technology demonstration, and collaborative problem-solving. The conference's growth from niche educational event to multidisciplinary gathering signals the maturation of the sustainability movement and its integration into mainstream business and policy considerations.</p>
