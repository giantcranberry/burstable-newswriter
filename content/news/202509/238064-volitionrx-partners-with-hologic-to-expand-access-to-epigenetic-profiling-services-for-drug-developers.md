<p>VolitionRx Ltd. has established a co-marketing and services partnership with Hologic Diagenode, a division of Hologic Inc., to expand distribution of Volition's Nu.Q Discover epigenetic profiling service to drug developers and research scientists. The collaboration represents a strategic move to increase accessibility to specialized epigenetic assays that support disease model development, preclinical testing, and clinical studies across multiple therapeutic areas.</p><p>Dr. Jasmine Kway, Chief Executive Officer of Singapore Volition, characterized the partnership as a significant milestone for the Nu.Q Discover program. This collaboration will greatly expand customer access to our proprietary Nu.Q Discover assays, which have an estimated total addressable market of $200 million annually, Kway stated. The company anticipates strengthening its position in the pharmaco-epigenetics market and growing revenues through this expanded distribution channel.</p><p>Raphael Werding, Head of Life Sciences at Hologic, expressed enthusiasm for incorporating Nu.Q Discover into the company's service portfolio. At Hologic, we have extensive experience not only in oncology but also in other disease areas such as cardiovascular, neurodegenerative, immunology and others; disease areas where we believe nucleosome quantification can provide additional valuable biological insights to our biotech, pharma and academic clients, Werding commented. The partnership leverages Hologic's established customer relationships and therapeutic area expertise.</p><p>The agreement spans an initial one-year term during which Hologic will co-market Nu.Q Discover with its existing customer base. The arrangement includes provisions for potential expansion into an exclusive provider relationship, contingent on performance metrics and additional terms. This collaboration reflects Volition's ongoing strategy to advance epigenetics science through partnerships with established industry leaders.
