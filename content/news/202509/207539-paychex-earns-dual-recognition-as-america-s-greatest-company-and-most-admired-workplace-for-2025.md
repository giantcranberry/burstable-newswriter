<p>Paychex, Inc. has achieved significant recognition from Newsweek, being named both one of America's Greatest Companies 2025 and one of America's Most Admired Workplaces. These dual honors reflect the company's comprehensive excellence across financial performance, workforce commitment, innovation, and corporate ethics.</p><p>The America's Greatest Companies ranking resulted from an in-depth analysis conducted by Newsweek and Plant-A Insights Group, evaluating companies across four key pillars of success. The methodology combined key performance indicators with qualitative reviews of public records and media coverage to assess financial performance, dedication to the American workforce, track record of innovation, and commitment to environmental sustainability and corporate ethics.</p><p>John Gibson, president and CEO of Paychex, emphasized the significance of these recognitions, stating that they reflect the company's strong financial performance, ongoing product innovation, and commitment to ethics in support of its mission to help businesses succeed. The Most Admired Workplaces designation particularly underscores the critical role played by Paychex's 19,000 employees in driving the company's achievements.</p><p>Newsweek Editor-in-Chief Jennifer H. Cunningham noted that creating a workplace where employees feel respected and valued is something only some companies excel at, making the Most Admired Workplaces recognition particularly meaningful. The list was compiled through a large-scale survey of over 250,000 U.S. employees and 1.5 million company reviews, assessing companies across eight categories and over 15 key performance indicators.</p><p>These latest honors add to Paychex's growing collection of 2025 recognitions, which already includes being named to Ethisphere's World's Most Ethical Companies and Fortune's America's Most Innovative Companies lists. The company's purpose-driven culture, rooted in six core values of integrity, partnership, accountability, respect, innovation, and service, has been developed over more than 50 years of operation.</p><p>For additional information about Paychex's corporate awards and honors, the company maintains an <a href="https://www.paychex.com/corporate/awards" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">awards page on their website</a> that details their various recognitions and achievements in the human capital management industry.</p>
