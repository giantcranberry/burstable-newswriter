<p>Successful real estate development in New York City requires understanding the intricate relationship between real estate and politics, according to Eldad Gothelf, Senior Vice President of Real Estate at Kasirer. With a Master's in Urban Planning from Columbia University, Gothelf approaches development through the lens of how policy, community needs, and government systems influence what gets built in the city.</p><p>In his role leading a team of 10 policy experts, Gothelf's work involves balancing external client conversations, internal strategy sessions, and on-the-ground site visits. He stresses that physical engagement with neighborhoods is crucial, as understanding community dynamics helps shape effective development strategies. The work requires technical knowledge of zoning and land use combined with political acumen and emotional intelligence to align different stakeholder needs.</p><p>Gothelf addresses the perception of lobbyists, explaining that his team acts as translators between developers who know how to build and community members who want development to support neighborhood goals. He emphasizes the importance of trustworthiness and consistency in a field where promises are often broken, noting that maintaining credibility is essential for making progress in New York's complex environment.</p><p>One notable project involved the <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/planning/zoning/districts-tools/mta-transit-oriented-development.page" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Metro-North rezoning in the Bronx</a>, where Gothelf worked with Himmel + Meringoff Properties to balance public interest in housing and equitable growth with private development viability. The project demonstrated how successful developments require alignment between city priorities, community needs, and private investment rather than just obtaining approvals.</p><p>Regarding the <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/planning/plans/city-of-yes/city-of-yes.page" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">City of Yes initiative</a>, Gothelf notes that while zoning reform provides clearer frameworks for housing development and conversions, projects must still make financial sense and earn community support. The initiative's importance lies in signaling the city's direction toward modernizing zoning rules to facilitate growth. Looking ahead, Gothelf believes New York must embrace growth through trust, transparency, and shared responsibility to maintain the city's competitiveness and inclusivity.</p>
