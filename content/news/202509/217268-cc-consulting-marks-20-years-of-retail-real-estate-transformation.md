<p>Cindy Ciura celebrates 20 years leading CC Consulting, her commercial real estate firm specializing in retail brokerage for High Street properties nationwide. The Bloomfield Hills-based company represents landlords and connects them with luxury and high-end retailers, leveraging Ciura's industry expertise developed through major retail developments and urban revitalization projects.</p><p>Ciura founded the firm in 2005 after 16 years in the industry, seeking to build an organization aligned with her values of integrity and positive impact. Her career foundation includes executive positions with industry leaders like The Forbes Company, Olympia Development, and Schostak Brothers & Company, where mentors including Sid Forbes, Atanas Ilitch, Mike Ilitch, and Bob Schostak provided crucial guidance for her entrepreneurial journey.</p><p>The firm's most significant impact appears in downtown Birmingham, Michigan, where Ciura has worked for approximately 10 years transforming an area once lacking national retail representation into a thriving destination. In Detroit, her 25-year involvement helped bring pioneering national retailers like Hard Rock Cafe and Borders Books to the Compuware Building, initiating momentum that now includes numerous national brands throughout the city.</p><p>CC Consulting's national reach extends to Florida markets including Orlando and Naples, where the firm strengthens tenant mixes on select properties. Additional work in Palm Beach, the Carolinas, California, Ohio, Chicago, and New York City demonstrates Ciura's approach to revitalizing cities, streets, and malls with fresh retail offerings. The firm's success in attracting luxury brands stems from long-standing retailer relationships, some dating back 20 years, and an ability to curate tenant mixes that encourage co-location among premium retailers.</p><p>Despite retail landscape evolution since 2005, Ciura challenges narratives about brick-and-mortar decline, noting that more retailers than ever actively seek physical locations. She emphasizes retail's enduring tactile experience while tailoring approaches to diverse markets through understanding unique characteristics from urban centers to smaller Business Improvement Districts. The firm's customized marketing materials address specific retailer needs with location-specific data and demographics.</p><p>Beyond business growth, Ciura values knowledge sharing through events, conferences, and institutions like Harvard, along with community contributions through nonprofit work. She serves on the Board of Directors of Michigan Humane, advocating for animal welfare, and supports Catholic Charities in converting Detroit's old elementary schools into low-cost homeless housing. Future expansion plans include new markets such as Washington, D.C., and exploring retail opportunities in convention centers, continuing adaptation within evolving retail environments.</p>
