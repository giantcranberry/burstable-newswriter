<p>Technology consulting firm Hylaine has established itself as one of the fastest-growing private companies in the U.S. by rejecting traditional consulting models in favor of values-led partnerships. Founded in 2017 by CEO Adam Boitnott, the company serves Fortune 1000 clients in highly regulated industries including banking, insurance, healthcare, and life sciences, focusing on putting client needs above the firm's own interests.</p><p>The company's approach emphasizes transparency and honesty without exception, even extending to walking away from projects where Hylaine isn't the best fit. This philosophy has strengthened long-term client relationships rather than damaging them. The firm's name reflects this commitment, combining the names of Boitnott's daughters with the concept of taking the high lane in business practices.</p><p>Hylaine addresses critical technology challenges facing large enterprises, including outdated systems, slow software development cycles, and unreliable data infrastructure. The company's core services encompass Advisory, Data & AI, Application Development, Cloud, and Delivery, all focused on modernizing systems and accelerating software delivery. This work proves particularly valuable in data-intensive industries where compliance, performance, and scalability are non-negotiable requirements.</p><p>One notable success story involved a Fortune 25 healthcare enterprise where Hylaine helped avoid over $1 million in risk exposure through data reliability improvements. The company implemented a comprehensive data reliability framework that included audit tools, validation engines, and reliability analytics, resulting in 80% faster root-cause analysis and auto-detection of more than 80% of data anomalies in key pipelines. This foundation enabled the client to transition a $1 billion-plus business to a new platform successfully.</p><p>The timing of Hylaine's values-driven approach is particularly relevant given current challenges companies face with AI implementation. Boitnott identifies the biggest barrier to AI success as foundational data issues rather than technical model problems. Companies are rushing into AI without clean, consistent data, clear governance, and scalable integration patterns. Hylaine addresses this by investing in data reliability engineering from day one of every engagement, recognizing that AI readiness represents an enterprise-wide test rather than merely an IT challenge.</p><p>Hylaine's growth strategy includes plans to expand its workforce by 50% over the next year while maintaining its privately held status. The company operates from five U.S. hubs in Charlotte, Atlanta, Dallas-Fort Worth, Indianapolis, and Raleigh, with expansion planned through both organic growth and strategic mergers and acquisitions. Backed by self-funding and venture capital support from Summit Park, Hylaine aims to deepen its focus on core industries while maintaining the values that have driven its success.</p>
