<p>SEGG Media Corporation has announced plans to reenter the domestic U.S. lottery market through official affiliate partnerships with state-operated iLottery programs and the launch of a nationwide lottery rewards program. The company, which owns digital assets including <a href="https://lottery.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Lottery.com</a>, has initiated approval processes to partner with lottery programs in Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Michigan.</p><p>Through these initiatives, SEGG Media aims to reconnect Lottery.com with U.S. players while driving responsible acquisition for state lotteries. The company plans to deliver exclusive promotions and experiences that benefit both players and retailers, leveraging its position as a global sports, entertainment and gaming conglomerate that also operates <a href="https://sports.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Sports.com</a> and <a href="https://concerts.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Concerts.com</a>.</p><p>The reentry into the U.S. lottery market represents a strategic move for SEGG Media, which focuses on immersive fan engagement, ethical gaming practices, and AI-driven live experiences. The company's approach aligns with its broader mission of redefining how global audiences interact with content across sports, entertainment, and gaming verticals.</p><p>The affiliate partnership model allows SEGG Media to serve as an official intermediary between state lotteries and players, providing a regulated framework for lottery participation while offering additional value through rewards and promotional opportunities. This structure enables the company to operate within existing regulatory frameworks while introducing innovative engagement strategies.</p><p>The nationwide lottery rewards program represents an additional layer of player benefits that extends beyond individual state partnerships. This program is designed to create cross-state engagement opportunities and provide consistent value to lottery participants regardless of their geographic location within the United States.</p><p>SEGG Media's reentry into the U.S. market comes at a time when digital lottery participation continues to grow, with state lotteries increasingly seeking partnerships that can drive responsible player acquisition while enhancing the overall player experience through technology and innovative engagement strategies.</p>
