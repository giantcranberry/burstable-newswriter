<p>SRS Real Estate Partners has finalized the $4.77 million sale of Central Ridge Plaza, a fully occupied retail center located at 1184 North Lecanto Highway in Lecanto, Florida. The transaction represents the ongoing strength of commercial real estate investments in growing Florida markets, particularly for properties with strong tenant profiles and strategic positioning.</p><p>The 10,800-square-foot property features four tenants: Sketchers, Firehouse Subs, Marco's Pizza, and Hair Cuttery, all operating from two buildings constructed in 2024. SRS Capital Markets professionals Connor Barton, Patrick Nutt, and William Wamble represented the Florida-based private developer seller, while the buyer consisted of an Orlando-based group of private investors. The sale closed at a capitalization rate of 6.27%, indicating robust market conditions for retail investments in the Tampa submarket.</p><p>According to Barton, the property's investment appeal stems from its new construction status and fully executed tenant leases with scheduled rental increases. The property offers new ownership limited landlord responsibilities and represents a low-management investment in a state with no income tax. Investors seeking financing have increasingly targeted such properties for their higher yield potential and income diversification benefits.</p><p>Central Ridge Plaza's location within a larger retail development featuring major anchors including Walmart Supercenter, Hobby Lobby, and Panda Express significantly enhances its investment value. The property's strategic positioning across from Shoppes at Black Diamond, a new 29-acre retail development anchored by Target, further strengthens its long-term value proposition. This transaction contributes to SRS Capital Markets' substantial transaction volume, which has exceeded $1.7 billion across more than 500 transactions nationwide this year.</p><p>The firm currently markets over 845 properties with a collective value surpassing $3.7 billion, demonstrating sustained activity in the commercial real estate sector.
