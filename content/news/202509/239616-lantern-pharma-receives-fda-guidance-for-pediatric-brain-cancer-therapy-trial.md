<p>Lantern Pharma Inc. has received critical regulatory guidance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration through a recent Type C meeting, paving the way for advancing its investigational therapy LP-184/STAR-001 toward clinical trials targeting pediatric central nervous system cancers. The Texas-based clinical-stage biotechnology company plans to launch its trial in the first quarter of 2026, focusing on rare pediatric brain cancers including Atypical Teratoid Rhabdoid Tumor.</p><p>The FDA meeting will help Lantern Pharma amend its investigational new drug submission for the potential pediatric cancer therapy, marking a significant step forward in addressing unmet medical needs in childhood cancer treatment. The company's proprietary computational biology and machine learning platform supports the development of its drug candidates, including LP-184/STAR-001, which represents one of several oncology programs in the company's pipeline.</p><p>Beyond the pediatric cancer program, Lantern Pharma is conducting trials targeting multiple other cancer types, including glioblastoma, triple-negative breast cancer, non-small cell lung cancer in non-smokers, and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. The company reported that two of its current trials achieved complete responses in patients during the past quarter, demonstrating progress across its broader oncology portfolio. Additional information about the company's developments is available through its <a href="https://ibn.fm/LTRN" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">newsroom</a>.</p><p>The regulatory guidance comes at a time when novel approaches to pediatric cancer treatment are critically needed, particularly for rare central nervous system tumors that often have limited treatment options. Lantern Pharma's platform-driven approach represents an emerging trend in oncology drug development, where computational methods help identify and optimize potential therapies for specific cancer subtypes.</p><p>The advancement of LP-184/STAR-001 through the regulatory process highlights the ongoing need for innovative treatments in pediatric oncology, where many cancers remain difficult to treat with conventional therapies. The planned 2026 trial launch positions Lantern Pharma to potentially address this significant medical challenge while continuing to expand its broader cancer treatment portfolio across multiple tumor types.</p>
