<p>The Futur/io Institute announced the winners of its second annual CSO Awards North America 25 during New York Climate Week, recognizing the critical role Chief Sustainability Officers play in advancing corporate sustainability goals. Workday's Erik Hansen received the Gold Award, while Western Digital's Jackie Jung earned Silver and Prologis's Susan Uthayakumar took Bronze in a ceremony that brought together sustainability leaders from across the region.</p><p>The awards ceremony featured two Special Honour awards for Tiffany & Co.'s Annika Dubrall and Colgate-Palmolive's Ann Tracy. Weyerhaeuser's Ara Erickson received the Sustainable Supply Chain Award presented by Simon Jaehnig of IntegrityNext Inc., while Philip Morris International's Jennifer Motles won the Peer Award chosen by the live audience. The event included speakers such as Sandrine Dixson-Decl√®ve of the Club of Rome and Nina Eisenman of NASDAQ, emphasizing sustainability leadership's growing importance in corporate governance.</p><p>Harald Neidhardt, CEO & Curator of the Futur/io Institute, stated that the organization's mission is to highlight Chief Sustainability Officers' role and inspire others to work toward building desirable futures. According to Neidhardt, this year's winners and 20 nominees demonstrate exceptional commitment to achieving Sustainable Development Goals and ambitious NetZero targets, with some companies aiming for 2040 or earlier. The awards come at a time when sustainability reporting faces significant challenges, with Futur/io noting delays compared to 2024 and some companies retracting earlier sustainability disclosures.</p><p>The selection process revealed substantial challenges in the current business climate, characterized by geopolitical headwinds, economic pressures, and potential greenhushing. The annual survey sent to major corporations lacked support from some CSOs, with notable absences among the 20 nominees from companies expected to be sustainability leaders. Winners were selected from a Top100 CSOs of North America 2025 list using a comprehensive four-quadrant model criteria developed with scientific partner the Leonardo Centre on Business for Society at Imperial College Business School.</p><p>Judging criteria considered corporate behavior maturity, regulatory performance on Environmental, Social, and Governance and Sustainable Development Goals criteria, net zero goals, environmental and human impact, and self-assessment surveys. The Grand Jury included influential sustainability voices such as John Elkington, Michael Kobori, and Vandinika Shukla of the Obama Foundation. Complete information about the awards and partners is available at <a href="https://futur.io" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://futur.io</a>.</p><p>The CSO Awards North America represents a collaboration with partner Made in Sustainability and premium partner Integrity Next, together with scientific partner the Leonardo Centre on Business for Society at Imperial College Business School. Knowledge partners included Denominator, Rainforest Partnership, Climate GPT, and Economist Impact, with Gold Partner CEEZER Software also supporting the initiative. The European edition occurred in Davos parallel to the World Economic Forum Annual Meeting 2025, demonstrating sustainability leadership recognition's global reach.</p><p>For business and technology leaders, these awards highlight the evolving landscape of corporate sustainability accountability. The recognition comes amid increasing regulatory pressures and stakeholder demands for transparent environmental, social, and governance reporting. The challenges identified in the selection process, including reporting delays and greenhushing tendencies, signal potential headwinds for organizations navigating complex sustainability commitments while maintaining business performance.</p>
