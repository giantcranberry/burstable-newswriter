Beeline strengthened its balance sheet by reducing debt by $2.7 million during the quarter, bringing year-to-date repayment to $6.2 million, and ended Q2 with $6.3 million in cash reserves. Management reaffirmed expectations to reach profitability by January 2026, citing growing revenue streams and continued cost discipline as key drivers.</p><p>Operational achievements included funding $52 million in mortgages, a 31% increase from Q1, and the successful introduction of innovative technology products.
