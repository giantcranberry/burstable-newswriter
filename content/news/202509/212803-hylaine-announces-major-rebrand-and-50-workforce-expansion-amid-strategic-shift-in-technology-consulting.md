<p>Hylaine has unveiled a comprehensive rebranding initiative alongside plans to increase its workforce by 50% over the next year, adding approximately 100 employees across its U.S. offices. This represents the most significant brand evolution since the company's founding in 2017 and signals a strategic shift in the competitive technology consulting landscape.</p><p>The Charlotte-based firm's new positioning emphasizes what it describes as a values-first approach to consulting, prioritizing long-term partnerships over transactional relationships. Founder and CEO Adam Boitnott stated, "We reject the traditional consulting model that's known for overpromising, underdelivering, and treating clients like transactions to score short-term wins." This philosophy has driven the company's remarkable growth, with a 216% revenue increase over the past three years and four consecutive appearances on the Inc. 5000 list.</p><p>The expansion will focus on leadership roles, industry subject matter experts in banking, insurance, healthcare, and life sciences, plus technical consulting positions. Hylaine serves major clients including a Fortune 25 healthcare enterprise, a top 20 U.S. retail bank, and a top 20 biotechnology firm, operating from regional hubs in Charlotte, Raleigh, Atlanta, Dallas-Fort Worth, and Indianapolis.</p><p>The company simultaneously launched its new brand identity across all digital channels, including its <a href="https://hylaine.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">website</a> and social media platforms. The updated visual identity features a hexagonal logo design that forms the letter "H," symbolizing the partnership approach central to the firm's mission.</p><p>Backed by investment from Summit Park, Hylaine plans aggressive organic growth and potential mergers and acquisitions while remaining privately held. The firm will sharpen its focus on regulated, data-intensive industries where compliance and performance requirements are particularly stringent. Tech leaders at Fortune 1000 companies typically engage Hylaine for high-stakes projects involving data modernization for AI readiness, legacy system updates, and accelerated software delivery through services including Advisory, Data & AI, Application Development, and Cloud solutions.</p>
