<p>Infleqtion, a global leader in neutral atom-based quantum technology, has entered into a definitive business combination agreement with Churchill Capital Corp X (NASDAQ: CCCX) that values the quantum company at $1.8 billion pre-money equity value. The transaction is expected to provide more than $540 million in gross proceeds to accelerate Infleqtion's mission to commercialize quantum products that offer orders of magnitude improvement in computing and precision sensing applications.</p><p>The merger represents a significant milestone for the quantum technology sector, as Infleqtion has demonstrated commercial traction with approximately $29 million in trailing twelve-month revenue as of June 30, 2025, reflecting an 80% compound annual growth rate over the past two years. The company has sold three quantum computers and hundreds of quantum sensors to customers including NVIDIA, the U.S. Department of Defense, NASA, and the U.K. government, with approximately $50 million of booked and awarded business expected by year-end 2025.</p><p>Michael Klein, Chairman and CEO of Churchill Capital Corp X, stated that Churchill Capital is proud to partner with companies shaping the future of technology, noting that Infleqtion stands out with its breakthrough neutral atom platform and proven engineering capabilities. The neutral atom technology modality is recognized for scalability, flexibility, and cost efficiency, enabling Infleqtion to power both quantum computing and precision sensing from a single product architecture.</p><p>Matt Kinsella, CEO and founding investor of Infleqtion, emphasized that the company has reached a critical inflection point in its journey from research and development to commercialization. The partnership with Churchill provides additional capital and strategic expertise required to accelerate commercialization, expand market leadership, and meet rapidly growing demand for quantum solutions across artificial intelligence, national security, and space applications.</p><p>The quantum computing and sensing markets are expected to exceed $160 billion in aggregate by 2040, spanning multiple industries including defense, energy, space, materials science, and financial services. Infleqtion's technology has strategic importance for national security, with allied governments having invested more than $40 billion in quantum technologies to secure geopolitical advantage.</p><p>Infleqtion has achieved industry-leading technical milestones, including a record 1,600 physical qubit array, 99.73% entangling fidelity (the highest achieved by a neutral atom company), and proof-of-concept demonstrated on eight logical qubits. The company is one of only two to demonstrate a real-world application using logical qubits, positioning it as a front-runner on the path to quantum advantage.</p><p>The transaction structure includes $416 million of cash held in Churchill X's trust account as of June 30, 2025, plus over $125 million of incremental financing via a common stock PIPE from leading institutional investors including Maverick Capital, Counterpoint Global (Morgan Stanley), Glynn Capital, BOKA Capital, and LCP Quantum. Proceeds will strengthen Infleqtion's balance sheet, accelerate technology development, expand applications to new markets, and scale customer adoption.</p><p>Kenneth Safar, Managing Director at Maverick Silicon, noted that quantum represents a defining technology opportunity of the coming decade, with neutral atoms positioned as the modality best positioned to succeed. Infleqtion demonstrates how quantum can enhance artificial intelligence today and deliver real performance gains across computing and sensing applications.</p><p>The boards of directors of both companies have unanimously approved the proposed business combination, subject to approval by Churchill X shareholders and satisfaction of customary closing conditions. Upon closing, the combined company will operate as Infleqtion and is expected to be listed on a leading North American exchange under the ticker INFQ.</p>
