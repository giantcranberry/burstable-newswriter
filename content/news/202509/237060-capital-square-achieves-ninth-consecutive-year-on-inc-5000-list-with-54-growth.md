<p>Capital Square has secured its position on the 2025 Inc. 5000 list of fastest-growing private companies for the ninth consecutive year, achieving a three-year growth rate of 54% and ranking No. 4,918 nationally. The firm, which specializes in tax-advantaged real estate investments and multifamily development, ranked 271 in Virginia and 118 in the real estate category nationwide, underscoring its competitive standing in a demanding industry.</p><p>Louis Rogers, founder and co-chief executive officer, attributed the consistent recognition to the company's foundational pillars. Capital Square is built on three pillars: Invest – the firm invests in tax-advantaged real estate. Build – we develop real estate in opportunity zones and elsewhere. Manage – we manage the firm’s assets. Each of these pillars contributes to the overall growth and success of the firm, Rogers stated. The firm's repeated inclusion on the Inc. 5000 list, which began in 2017, reflects its ability to maintain momentum since its founding in 2012.</p><p>Whitson Huffman, co-chief executive officer and chief investment officer, emphasized the significance of this achievement. It is a testament to the talent and dedication of the Capital Square team that we have earned a place on the Inc. 5000 list for nine consecutive years, Huffman said. Ranking among the top real estate firms nationally and as one of the fastest-growing companies in the U.S. highlights Capital Square’s strong position in a highly competitive industry.</p><p>The company's growth has been fueled by strategic expansions, including the launch of a development arm in 2019 that has delivered 979 mixed-use apartment units and is currently building or planning 1,020 additional units. Many of these projects are situated within qualified opportunity zones, positioning Capital Square as a leading sponsor of qualified opportunity zone funds. Notable developments include Otis, recognized as CoStar’s 2024 Multifamily Development of the Year, and Maeve, which received ENR Texas & Southeast’s 2025 Award of Merit in Residential/Hospitality.</p><p>In 2023, Capital Square further diversified its operations by establishing Capital Square Living, a wholly owned subsidiary dedicated to managing the firm's multifamily portfolio of over 40 apartment communities across the Southeast. This division was named one of Multi-Housing News’ Top Multifamily Property Management Companies of 2024, ranking No. 71 nationwide in only its second year of operation. The firm's broader accomplishments include sponsoring more than 140 investment offerings, acquiring over 175 real estate assets, and distributing more than $543 million to investors since 2012. Additional recognition came in January 2024, when Capital Square earned the AMO® accreditation from IREM®, joining an exclusive group of real estate management companies worldwide.
