<p>Charbone Hydrogen Corporation has executed replacement debentures totaling $2,050,000, restructuring terms of existing secured convertible debentures originally issued through a private placement. The financial restructuring extends the maturity date from September and October 2025 to September 30, 2026, providing the company with additional time to execute its growth strategy.</p><p>The revised terms increase the convertible balance from $1.7 million to $2.1 million while maintaining a 12% annual interest rate payable monthly. Additionally, the conversion price has been reduced from $0.10 to $0.07 per common share, potentially making the investment more attractive to current debenture holders. The arrangement requires approval from the TSX Venture Exchange, where Charbone trades under the symbol CH.</p><p>According to Benoit Veilleux, Chief Financial Officer and Corporate Secretary, these modifications provide enhanced financial flexibility by significantly extending maturities and supplying additional capital. The funds will be used to complete the acquisition of operational hydrogen production and refueling equipment announced on September 5, 2025. This strategic move supports Charbone's position in the competitive green hydrogen sector, where first-mover advantages can be critical for market establishment.</p><p>The restructuring aligns with Charbone's focus on ultra-high purity hydrogen production and industrial gas distribution across North America and the Asia-Pacific region. The company employs a modular network approach that partners with existing industry players to supply helium and specialty gases without constructing new facilities, potentially reducing capital expenditures and accelerating market entry.

The extended maturity and increased convertible balance provide Charbone with crucial runway to deploy operational equipment and establish production capabilities, potentially positioning the company for stronger competitive standing in the rapidly evolving hydrogen economy. The reduction in conversion price may also signal management's confidence in making equity conversion more attractive to investors, balancing debt servicing costs with potential equity dilution.</p>
