<p>Terra Innovatum Srl, a developer of micro-modular nuclear reactors, has signed a memorandum of understanding with Ameresco (NYSE: AMRC), a leading energy solutions provider, to establish a comprehensive framework for deploying SOLO micro-modular reactors across U.S. and international markets. The partnership aims to leverage Ameresco's national network and expertise to identify siting opportunities on public and private land, targeting the deployment of 50 reactor units across federal and commercial sites.</p><p>The collaboration represents a major step toward near-term commercial rollout of the SOLO reactor technology. Alessandro Petruzzi, CEO of Terra Innovatum, emphasized that Ameresco's deep industry network and expertise in delivering innovative energy solutions will play a crucial role in SOLO's commercial deployment. Through Ameresco's support in identifying and securing deployment sites, Terra Innovatum has an opportunity to expand its reach and advance its market vision.</p><p>Giordano Morichi, Partner, Chief Business Development Officer & Investor Relations at Terra Innovatum, noted that the partnership provides a multi-tiered and diversified path to market, enabling parallel deployment while pursuing U.S. government and private sector opportunities. The collaboration aims to advance the commercialization of 50 SOLO reactor units while addressing critical security needs in the U.S. and international markets.</p><p>Nicole Bulgarino, President of Federal Solutions and Utility Infrastructure at Ameresco, highlighted that Ameresco brings decades of experience in delivering advanced energy solutions across federal and commercial markets. The company is excited to collaborate with Terra Innovatum and leverage their innovative technology to deliver critical power where it is needed most, supporting mission readiness and energy assurance in an evolving global landscape.</p><p>The SOLO micro-modular reactor, conceptualized in 2018 and engineered over six years by nuclear safety, licensing, innovation, and R&D experts, addresses pressing global energy demands with a market-ready solution. Built from readily available commercial off-the-shelf components, the proven licensing path for SOLO enables rapid deployment and minimizes supply chain risks while ensuring final cost predictability. The reactor is designed to adapt with evolving fuel options, supporting both LEU+ and HALEU fuels.</p><p>SOLO offers versatile applications, providing CO2-free, behind-the-meter, and off-grid power solutions for data centers, mini-grids serving remote communities, and large-scale industrial operations in hard-to-abate sectors like cement production, oil and gas, steel manufacturing, and mining. The technology also supplies heat for industrial applications and specialized processes including water treatment, desalination, and co-generation. Its modular design allows easy scaling to deliver up to 1GW or more of CO2-free power with minimal footprint, making it suitable for rapidly replacing fossil fuel-based thermal plants. Additional applications include medical sector contributions through production of radioisotopes essential for oncology research and cancer treatment.
