<p>Cyan AG reported a substantial financial turnaround in the first half of 2025, achieving positive EBITDA of €0.5 million compared to a negative €1.1 million during the same period in 2024. The company's revenue increased by 37% to €4.4 million, up from €3.2 million in the first half of 2024, marking a significant recovery following a period of restructuring focused on its core cybersecurity business.</p><p>The positive performance stems from cyan's consistent implementation of its growth strategy, which emphasizes cybersecurity solutions while maintaining strict cost discipline. CEO and CTO Markus Cserna highlighted the company's operational progress, including the extension of the global group contract with the Orange Group for at least another three years and market entries in Latin America through partnerships with Claro Chile and a Mobile Virtual Network Operator in Mexico. These strategic moves have strengthened cyan's international market position and are expected to facilitate further expansion into additional countries.</p><p>A key driver of cyan's growth has been the 24% increase in its end customer base during the first half of 2025, which underpins rising monthly recurring revenues that now account for 97% of total revenue. This growth is attributed to both the development of existing customer relationships and new contracts. Additionally, the company launched cyan Guard 360, a cost-effective cybersecurity solution tailored for small and medium-sized enterprises, further diversifying its product offerings and addressing market demand from businesses and end customers alike.</p><p>Based on the strong first-half results and planned investments, primarily in new employees, cyan has specified its outlook for 2025. The company now expects revenue to range between €8.8 million and €9.2 million, with slightly positive EBITDA that is unlikely to exceed the level achieved in the first half of the year. This forecast reflects cyan's confidence in its growth trajectory, supported by new partnerships, a focused product strategy, and an improved financial position.</p><p>The turnaround underscores the increasing demand for cybersecurity solutions in an evolving digital landscape, positioning cyan for sustained growth in the competitive IT security market. For business leaders, cyan's success demonstrates the viability of specialized cybersecurity providers in an era where digital threats continue to escalate across industries. The company's focus on recurring revenue models and international expansion provides a blueprint for technology firms seeking stable growth in volatile market conditions.</p>
