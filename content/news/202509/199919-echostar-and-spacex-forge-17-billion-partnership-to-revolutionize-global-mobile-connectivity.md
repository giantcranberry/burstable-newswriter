<p>EchoStar Corporation has entered into a definitive agreement with SpaceX involving a $17 billion spectrum sale and long-term commercial partnership that promises to reshape global mobile connectivity. The transaction includes the sale of EchoStar's AWS-4 and H-block spectrum licenses for approximately $17 billion, consisting of up to $8.5 billion in cash and up to $8.5 billion in SpaceX stock valued at the time of agreement.</p><p>Beyond the financial terms, SpaceX will fund approximately $2 billion of cash interest payments on EchoStar debt through November 2027. The commercial agreement will enable EchoStar's Boost Mobile subscribers to access SpaceX's next-generation Starlink Direct to Cell service through EchoStar's cloud-native 5G core infrastructure.</p><p>Hamid Akhavan, president and CEO of EchoStar, emphasized the strategic vision behind the deal, stating that the company has spent the past decade acquiring spectrum and facilitating worldwide 5G standards with the foresight that direct-to-cell connectivity via satellite would fundamentally change global communications. The transaction combines EchoStar's spectrum assets with SpaceX's rocket launch and satellite capabilities to realize this vision more innovatively, economically, and rapidly for consumers worldwide.</p><p>Gwynne Shotwell, president and COO of SpaceX, expressed enthusiasm for the partnership, noting that it advances SpaceX's mission to eliminate mobile dead zones globally. SpaceX's first-generation Starlink satellites with Direct to Cell capabilities have already connected millions of people during critical situations, including natural disasters where users needed to contact emergency responders and loved ones in areas previously off the grid.</p><p>The agreement represents a significant milestone in satellite communications development. With exclusive spectrum access, SpaceX will develop next-generation Starlink Direct to Cell satellites that promise a substantial performance improvement, enabling enhanced coverage for customers anywhere in the world. The transaction, along with EchoStar's previously announced spectrum sale, is expected to resolve ongoing Federal Communications Commission inquiries.</p><p>EchoStar plans to use the transaction proceeds for retiring certain debt obligations and funding continued operations and growth initiatives. The company confirmed that current operations of DISH TV, Sling, and Hughes services will not be impacted by the transaction. Closing of the proposed transaction is contingent upon receiving all required regulatory approvals and satisfying other closing conditions.</p>
