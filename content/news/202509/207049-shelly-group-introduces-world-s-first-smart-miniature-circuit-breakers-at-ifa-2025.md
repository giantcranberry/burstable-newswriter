<p>Shelly Group SE is accelerating its expansion into the professional building and energy management market with the introduction of the world's first smart miniature circuit breakers in a compact 1M form factor. This innovation combines maximum electrical safety with advanced smart control capabilities, enabling real-time monitoring for early detection of energy consumption anomalies such as unusual usage patterns, overconsumption, or appliance malfunctions.</p><p>The new Shelly Smart Miniature Circuit Breakers are available with B- and C-trip characteristics, 1P+N poles, and rated currents ranging from 6A to 25A. For communication, the devices offer two modern options: Z-Wave LR and Bluetooth combined with Zigbee, providing broad connectivity for professional electrical installations and building automation applications. In critical events like fire or flooding, the system enables remote power disconnection per branch, minimizing risk and damage to properties.</p><p>Beyond the miniature breakers, Shelly is expanding its portfolio with a comprehensive line of professional smart circuit breakers ranging from 1- to 4-pole devices supporting currents from 10A to 63A. These devices feature compact DIN-rail form factors and are designed for standard residential and industrial applications. All breakers include integrated Ethernet, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth connectivity, ensuring maximum flexibility and seamless integration across various use cases.</p><p>The global smart circuit breaker market, estimated at approximately $2.5 billion in 2024 according to <a href="https://www.marketresearchintellect.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Market Research Intellect</a>, is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of about 10.5% to exceed $5.8 billion by 2033. This growth is driven by rising demand for energy efficiency and safety, increasing integration of smart grids and renewable energy, broader adoption of smart homes and intelligent buildings, and technological advancements in IoT, artificial intelligence, and cloud integration.</p><p>Wolfgang Kirsch, Co-CEO of Shelly Group, stated that this development represents a major step in opening up the professional building and energy management market while combining maximum safety with smart control to create significant added value for customers. The development of Shelly Smart Miniature Circuit Breakers has been completed, with certification processes scheduled to begin at the end of September and mass production planned immediately after certification completion. Market launch is targeted for early 2026.</p>
