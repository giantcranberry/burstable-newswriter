<p>Swedish education technology company Mathleaks is expanding its operations to the United States with a focus on providing AI-powered math instruction and developing financial literacy resources for K-12 education. The company, which has reached more than 2.5 million students and educators globally, aims to address two key priorities in American education: enhancing mathematics instruction through personalized learning and contributing to more effective financial literacy education.</p><p>Mathleaks co-founder Jesper MÃ¥rtensson emphasized the company's mission, stating that both strong math skills and foundational financial literacy are essential to lifelong success. The company is committed to empowering U.S. educators with tools needed to deliver both subjects effectively. The U.S. initiative will begin by offering AI-powered math resources alongside teacher-facing financial literacy sample materials and educator webinars designed to gather direct feedback from American educators.</p><p>The financial literacy component addresses a significant education gap in the United States. According to a 2024 national report, only 27% of U.S. high school students attend schools where personal finance is required as a standalone course, with an additional 16% receiving financial education integrated into other required courses. This leaves over half of American students with access to elective courses or no financial education at all.</p><p>Mathleaks will introduce its fully U.S.-ready AI-powered math curriculum to Departments of Education, private school communities, and educational councils nationwide through its U.S. initiative. The company's approach positions AI as a behind-the-scenes assistant rather than an automation-heavy model, ensuring educators remain in full control of instruction while benefiting from tools that track student progress and differentiate lessons.</p><p>Both math and financial literacy modules incorporate an AI-powered adaptive engine that adjusts instructional content in real time based on student inputs. The system helps identify where learners may need additional support and offers personalized learning paths to build competence and confidence. Initial U.S. pilot content includes foundational math modules and financial literacy modules covering topics such as budgeting, saving, investing, and credit management.</p><p>The U.S. version of the platform will feature editable content templates, state-specific adaptability, and compatibility with both hybrid and in-person learning environments. Mathleaks plans to expand outreach to private schools and additional state education networks as the initiative progresses, with growth remaining measured and educator-driven based on feedback gathered during the pilot phase.</p><p>Unlike conventional curriculum providers, Mathleaks aims to serve as an innovation partner, developing adaptive educational resources through collaboration, transparency, and alignment with state and local needs. The company's philosophy centers on technology serving teachers rather than replacing them, building on its proven success in Sweden where the platform serves as a dynamic alternative to traditional math textbooks.</p>
