<p>Duos Technologies Group, Inc. has deployed its fifth edge data center through subsidiary Duos Edge AI, Inc., partnering with Dumas Independent School District in Texas to establish on-premise computing infrastructure that supports K-12 education and regional development. This deployment represents a strategic move toward the company's goal of 15 nationwide installations by year-end, focusing particularly on underserved rural markets where traditional data center access remains limited.</p><p>The Dumas ISD Edge Data Center will function as a localized hub for real-time data processing, enabling advanced educational tools, enhanced digital infrastructure, and improved connectivity for approximately 4,300 students and staff across seven campuses. Raymond Brady, Director of Information Technology at Dumas ISD, emphasized the significance of this partnership for a rural community, noting that it brings cutting-edge technology directly to the district and supports their mission of achieving academic excellence through collaboration with students, parents, and the community.</p><p>Doug Recker, President of Duos Technologies Group and founder of Duos Edge AI, highlighted how edge technology creates lasting impact in rural communities by placing powerful computing infrastructure directly on campus. This approach helps schools unlock real-time digital tools that drive student achievement, workforce readiness, and community growth while minimizing latency and optimizing performance through proximity to end users.</p><p>The deployment is part of Duos Edge AI's broader 2025 plan to establish modular edge data centers nationwide, with a focus on underserved and high-growth markets. By locating advanced computing infrastructure closer to end users, the company ensures reliable, secure, and scalable technological access for schools, healthcare facilities, and local communities. The company's edge data centers provide 100 kW+ per cabinet with rapid 90-day deployment and continuous 24/7 data services, positioning computing resources within 12 miles of end users rather than relying on distant traditional data centers.</p><p>For more information about Duos Edge AI's technology solutions, visit <a href="https://www.duosedge.ai" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.duosedge.ai</a>.
