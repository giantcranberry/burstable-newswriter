<p>A joint venture between Stella Marinas and Drake Real Estate Partners has acquired South River Marina and Turkey Point Marina & Yacht Club, two adjacent properties on the South River in Edgewater, Maryland. The combined facility now ranks among the largest marinas on the Chesapeake Bay with over 500 wet slips and dry racks, positioning it as a major boating destination in the region.</p><p>The strategic location offers significant advantages for boaters, situated just 30 minutes from Washington, D.C. and Baltimore, and only five miles from Annapolis. The marinas are located in a protected cove with quick access to the Chesapeake Bay, making them an ideal home port for boaters seeking convenience and accessibility.</p><p>The acquisition brings comprehensive boating services under one management, including lift slip and dry rack storage for powerboats up to 40 feet, experienced marine technicians, fuel services, and dry winter storage. Ryan Comisky, Owner of Stella Marinas, emphasized the vision behind the consolidation: "We're bringing together two exceptional properties to create a marina destination where boaters can dock, dine, refuel, and relax â€” all in one place."</p><p>To further enhance the boating experience, Stella Marinas has announced partnerships with Five Star Hospitality, which will operate the High Tide Grill serving casual waterfront fare, and Rudy Marine, which will offer Jeanneau outboard-powered cruisers and Bentley pontoon boats for sale on site. These additions create a comprehensive waterfront ecosystem that serves both recreational and practical boating needs.</p><p>David Cotterman, Co-Founder & Chief Investment Officer of Drake Real Estate Partners, highlighted the investment significance: "Drake is thrilled to partner with Stella Marinas on the acquisition of Turkey Point and South River Marinas. These investments represent an opportunity to enhance the Edgewater boating community while advancing Drake's value-add strategy investing in high-quality real estate."</p><p>The consolidation of these marinas represents a significant development in Chesapeake Bay's boating infrastructure, creating a centralized destination that addresses the growing demand for comprehensive marine services in the region. The strategic partnerships and planned upgrades position the facility to serve as a model for modern marina operations, combining practical boating services with recreational amenities in a prime location accessible to major metropolitan areas.</p>
