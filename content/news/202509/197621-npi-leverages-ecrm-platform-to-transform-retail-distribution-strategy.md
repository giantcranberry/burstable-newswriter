<p>Nutritional Products International announced its executive team will attend the ECRM Vitamin, Weight Management & Sports Nutrition Session at the PGA National Resort & Spa in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida. The event represents a significant shift from traditional retail distribution methods that previously required extensive travel to corporate headquarters.</p><p>ECRM events connect product manufacturers with retail buyers through private, one-on-one meetings designed to establish lasting business relationships. For NPI, these sessions provide a streamlined alternative to the decades founder and CEO Mitch Gould spent traveling across the United States to personally meet buyers at major retail corporate offices. Gould stated that before ECRM, he personally traveled to virtually every major retail headquarters in the country including Costco, Walgreens, CVS, Walmart, Rite Aid, Kmart, Sam's Club, and 7-Eleven, securing millions of dollars in orders through direct engagement.</p><p>The ECRM platform aligns with NPI's proprietary "Evolution of Distribution" system, a turnkey approach that helps domestic and international brands launch or expand in the U.S. market by handling sales, marketing, logistics, and follow-up. Gould explained that the platform allows NPI to introduce innovative products directly to retail buyers in a focused setting while providing clients with a proven path from concept to cart. This approach has particular significance given Gould's 35-year career spanning every retail channel, working with consumer goods across health, wellness, sports nutrition, and general merchandise.</p><p>The session serves as a premier platform for innovation in the health and wellness industry, bringing together product manufacturers and leading retail buyers for private, pre-scheduled meetings designed to foster new partnerships and accelerate product placement in the competitive supplement market. This collaborative model demonstrates how digital transformation is reshaping traditional business development approaches, potentially reducing costs and increasing efficiency for both manufacturers and retailers in the rapidly evolving health and wellness sector.</p>
