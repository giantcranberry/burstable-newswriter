<p>Rosenberg & Estis, P.C. has secured its position among Crain's New York City Best Places to Work for the third consecutive year, underscoring the firm's sustained commitment to fostering an exceptional workplace environment. The recognition stems from a rigorous evaluation conducted by <a href="https://workforceresearchgroup.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Workforce Research Group</a> in partnership with Crain's New York Business, which involves in-depth analysis of workplace policies and confidential employee surveys measuring culture, engagement, benefits, and work-life balance.</p><p>Since initially participating in the program in 2023, Rosenberg & Estis has demonstrated remarkable upward mobility in the rankings, advancing from No. 98 to 59 last year and now achieving the 37th position. This consistent improvement reflects the firm's proactive efforts to enhance employee satisfaction and organizational health. Michael E. Lefkowitz, Managing Member, emphasized that this accolade holds particular significance as it is derived directly from employee feedback, highlighting the firm's dedication to personal-professional balance and providing essential support and resources for career advancement.</p><p>The timing of this recognition aligns with the firm's strategic expansion in both scale and service capabilities, building upon its established expertise in real estate transactions, tax, zoning, and regulatory counsel. This growth has been intentionally paired with a focused investment in talent cultivation and professional development across all levels of the organization. The firm's approach demonstrates how prioritizing employee well-being and development can complement business objectives and drive sustained success.</p><p>For business and technology leaders, Rosenberg & Estis's achievement offers valuable insights into the tangible benefits of investing in workplace culture. In competitive industries, particularly those requiring high levels of expertise and client service, employee satisfaction directly correlates with retention, productivity, and ultimately, client outcomes. The firm's model illustrates how organizations can achieve both operational excellence and employee fulfillment, serving as a benchmark for other firms aiming to balance growth with human-centric practices.</p><p>Founded in 1975, Rosenberg & Estis recently celebrated its 50th anniversary, having evolved from a two-person partnership to a robust firm of over 180 professionals. The firm advises many of New York's most prominent owners, lenders, investors, and commercial tenants, and its multiple 'Best Places to Work' honors reinforce the strategic advantage of maintaining an employee-first culture that promotes both work-life balance and professional achievement.</p>
