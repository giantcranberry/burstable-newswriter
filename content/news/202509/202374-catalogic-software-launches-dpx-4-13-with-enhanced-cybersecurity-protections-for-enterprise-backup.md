<p>Catalogic Software has released DPX 4.13, the latest version of its enterprise backup and recovery solution designed to combat growing cybersecurity threats targeting data protection infrastructure. The update addresses critical vulnerabilities in traditional backup approaches that have become prime targets for ransomware attacks and data corruption schemes.</p><p>The DPX platform offers a unified, software-defined solution that eliminates the need for multiple vendors typically required for backup software, storage, and ransomware protection. This integrated approach reduces complexity and potential failure points while operating on existing organizational hardware. The system protects against threats ranging from accidental deletions to sophisticated ransomware attacks, ensuring all backups remain immutable, encrypted, verified, and ready for clean recovery.</p><p>DPX 4.13 introduces several significant advancements including automated backup integrity checks, proactive malware scans, restore point selection capabilities, and seamless network reconfiguration features. These enhancements enable organizations to validate recoverability, strengthen cyber-resilience, and streamline disaster recovery operations from a single platform. The update includes major improvements such as Backup Verification with new safeguards to ensure backups are recoverable and free from malware, Enhanced Rapid Return to Production for VMware environments that improves recovery time objectives and recovery point objectives, and Improved vStor Ransomware Defense with GuardMode technology that scans agentless VMware and block-level backup jobs to detect threats before restoration.</p><p>Ryan Kaw, Vice President of Sales at Catalogic Software, stated that the new capabilities give customers confidence that their backups are recoverable, secure, and flexible enough to meet today's complex restore scenarios. For additional information about the platform's features, visit <a href="https://www.catalogicsoftware.com/products/dpx" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">the DPX Product Page</a>. The company has been providing secure data protection solutions for over 25 years, focusing on helping IT organizations protect, secure, and leverage their critical business data through innovative backup and recovery technologies.</p><p>The implications of this release are significant for enterprise security teams and IT leaders who face increasing pressure to ensure data resilience against evolving cyber threats. By integrating ransomware protection directly into backup systems, organizations can reduce their attack surface and improve recovery capabilities, potentially saving millions in ransomware payments and business disruption costs. The automated verification features address one of the most critical challenges in data protection: ensuring that backups are actually recoverable when needed most.</p>
