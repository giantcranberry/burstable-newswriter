<p>BayFirst Financial Corp., parent company of BayFirst National Bank, has announced plans to exit the SBA 7(a) lending business and sell $103 million of SBA 7(a) loan balances to Banesco USA. The transaction represents a significant strategic shift for BayFirst as it moves away from government-backed small business lending to focus on its core community banking operations.</p><p>Thomas G. Zernick, Chief Executive Officer of BayFirst, stated that management and the board initiated a comprehensive strategic review earlier this year aimed at derisking SBA 7(a) balances on the balance sheet and positioning the company for long-term growth and enhanced shareholder value. The definitive agreement with Banesco USA marks a major milestone in these efforts, with the transaction expected to close in the fourth quarter of this year.</p><p>The loans will be sold at 97% of retained balances, and Banesco USA will assume servicing of these loans. Additionally, Banesco USA will purchase for book value the servicing rights associated with the purchased loans and will conduct servicing for all SBA loans that BayFirst will continue to own. The majority of BayFirst's current SBA lending staff and support teams will be offered positions with Banesco USA, ensuring continuity for borrowers while allowing BayFirst to exit the business line.</p><p>Zernick emphasized that despite exiting SBA 7(a) lending, BayFirst remains deeply committed to its community bank mission of serving individuals, families, and small businesses with stable checking and savings products that contribute to a more predictable, low-cost funding base. This relationship-driven approach continues to strengthen the bank's presence across the Tampa Bay region and creates opportunities to expand its community bank portfolio, deposit growth, and fee income sources like treasury management services.</p><p>For Banesco USA, this acquisition represents a strategic expansion into national SBA lending. Calixto (Cali) Garcia-Velez, President & CEO of Banesco USA, stated that through the addition of BayFirst's SBA lending team and the acquisition of the SBA 7(a) loan portfolio, Banesco USA gains the infrastructure, expertise, and enhanced capabilities to deliver SBA lending on a national scale. As a business bank, Banesco USA recognizes that small businesses are the backbone of the economy, and this transaction aligns with the bank's growth strategy to expand its small business lending capabilities.</p><p>The acquisition also establishes Banesco USA's presence in the Greater Tampa Bay region while positioning the bank to serve more small and mid-size companies across Florida and nationally. Banesco USA is an independent, Florida state-chartered bank with over $5 billion in assets and eight locations across South Florida and Puerto Rico. The bank distinguishes itself in providing personalized customer service and a suite of products and services to domestic and international clients.

The movement of experienced SBA lending teams between institutions also highlights the competitive nature of small business lending and the value of specialized expertise in this sector.</p>
