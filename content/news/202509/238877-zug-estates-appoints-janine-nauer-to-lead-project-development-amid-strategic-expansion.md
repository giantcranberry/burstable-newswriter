Prior to her role at Swiss Life Asset Management, she spent five years as a project manager and team lead at a Swiss real estate service provider, specializing in project development and realization. Her career foundation includes eight years working in project management as an architect, providing her with comprehensive understanding of construction processes from conception through completion.</p><p>The new appointee holds a Master of Arts in Architecture from Lucerne University of Applied Sciences and Arts (HSLU) and an Executive MBA in General Management from the University of St. Gallen (HSG). This combination of architectural expertise and business management education positions her to effectively lead Zug Estates' development projects while aligning with corporate strategic objectives.</p><p>Nauer will succeed Peter Wicki, who has decided to pursue new professional challenges after more than six successful years with Zug Estates. During his tenure as a member of Group Management, Wicki played a key role in shaping the company's development trajectory. The Board of Directors expressed gratitude for his commitment and contributions to the Zug Estates Group.</p><p>Zug Estates Group focuses on designing, developing, marketing, and managing properties in the Zug region, with particular emphasis on centrally located sites that support mixed-use development and sustainable growth principles. The company's portfolio primarily comprises two significant sites in Zug and Risch-Rotkreuz, alongside operation of a city resort in Zug featuring Park Hotel Zug and City Garden business hotels plus multiple restaurants.

Additional corporate information is available at <a href="https://www.zugestates.ch" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.zugestates.ch</a>.</p><p>The leadership transition occurs as Zug Estates prepares for key corporate events in early 2026, including publication of the Annual Report and Sustainability Report on February 19, 2026, followed by the General Meeting of Shareholders on April 8, 2026. Nauer's appointment reflects the company's strategic focus on strengthening its project development capabilities amid ongoing portfolio expansion and sustainability initiatives in Switzerland's competitive real estate market.
