<p>Julie Dermer, a Master Instructor at SoulCycle, has built a significant career in fitness by embracing authenticity and continuous personal evolution. Starting as a rider when the first studio opened in 2007, Dermer was inspired by the transformative benefits of the classes and decided to audition as an instructor as she approached her 40th birthday, marking a pivotal shift in her professional path.</p><p>Dermer's teaching philosophy centers on helping riders tap into their uninhibited selves, emphasizing that success is self-defined. She aims for every participant to leave feeling powerful and accomplished, regardless of their experience level. This approach is supported by her commitment to keeping classes fresh through evolving music selections, remixes, and incorporating strength work on the bike to challenge riders beyond their limits.</p><p>Over her 14-year tenure, the most challenging aspect has been maintaining innovation in her classes, which has driven both professional and personal growth. Dermer trains with a coach, takes classes, and draws motivation from other instructors to ensure she can deliver strong performances. Her career evolution, beginning while raising two young children and juggling other jobs, has reinforced her message of uncovering hidden strength, a theme she hopes riders internalize.</p><p>Balancing her high-energy career with personal life and self-care is achieved through mindfulness and activities that replenish her energy, such as Pilates, yoga, and social engagements. Dermer values these practices for keeping her grounded and ready to meet demands. Looking ahead, she plans to continue teaching, sharing experiences on social media, and collaborating on projects that empower people, particularly women, including returning to coach at <a href="https://www.weightwatchers.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Weight Watchers</a> and working with SoulCycle founder Julie Rice.</p><p>For aspiring fitness professionals, Dermer advises trusting oneself and the journey, emphasizing simplicity and authenticity in creating meaningful experiences. Her story underscores the importance of late-career shifts and the impact of genuine connection in the fitness industry, highlighting how personal evolution can inspire and empower others in transformative ways.</p>
