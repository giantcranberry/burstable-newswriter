<p>Archway Capital LLC has provided a $42.9 million loan to Steerpoint Capital for the acquisition of a 727,000-square-foot portion of The Shoppes at Carlsbad, a 1.1 million-square-foot retail center in San Diego County. The acquired property is currently 74% occupied with prominent tenants including Yard House, The Cheesecake Factory, Hollister, American Eagle Outfitters, Dave & Busters, 24 Hour Fitness, and Regal.</p><p>This transaction represents Archway Capital's largest and most complex deal to date, highlighting the firm's growing capability to handle substantial commercial real estate financing needs that traditional financial institutions often overlook. Bobby Khorshidi, CEO and CIO of Archway Capital, stated that the loan was secured because the borrower trusted the firm to move quickly and remain flexible, valuing their successful track record with complex transactions.</p><p>Khorshidi emphasized that unlike traditional banks constrained by rigid underwriting standards, Archway customized this loan, accepted the risk profile, and offered a non-recourse structure rare for deals of this size and complexity. This approach demonstrates how alternative lenders are increasingly filling critical financing gaps in the commercial real estate market, particularly for transactions requiring specialized underwriting and flexible terms.</p><p>The borrower has allocated $4 million for property improvements, including entrance upgrades, enhanced common area seating, digital signage additions, and bathroom renovations. Located at 2525 El Camino Real in Carlsbad, the coastal 98-acre property serves an affluent, densely populated area at the junction of Interstate 5 and Highway 78. The Shoppes at Carlsbad was renovated in 2017 and provides a customer-friendly, family-oriented atmosphere with diverse retail, dining, and entertainment offerings.</p><p>For more information on Archway Capital's commercial real estate financing solutions, visit <a href="https://archwayfund.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://archwayfund.com</a>. The transaction underscores continued investor confidence in well-located retail properties despite broader market challenges, particularly those offering mixed-use experiences that combine shopping, dining, and entertainment in high-traffic locations. This deal signals that alternative lenders are becoming essential partners for complex commercial real estate transactions that require speed, flexibility, and specialized underwriting expertise.</p>
