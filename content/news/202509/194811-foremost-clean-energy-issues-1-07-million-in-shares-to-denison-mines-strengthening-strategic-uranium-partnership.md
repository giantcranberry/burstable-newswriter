<p>Foremost Clean Energy Ltd. has issued 485,000 common shares to Denison Mines Corp. at $2.20 per share, generating total proceeds of $1,067,000 under the companies' Amended & Restated Investor Rights Agreement dated July 23, 2025. This transaction elevates Denison's ownership to approximately 19.17% of Foremost's outstanding common shares, marking a significant deepening of the strategic relationship between the two mining companies focused on critical mineral exploration.</p><p>The share issuance, approved by the Canadian Securities Exchange, relates to Denison's equity participation right on prior warrant exercises and property payments. The newly issued shares will be subject to a four-month-plus-one-day hold period, providing market stability while enabling both companies to advance their collaborative exploration efforts in uranium and lithium projects. This financial commitment underscores the partners' dedication to developing domestic sources of clean energy minerals.</p><p>Foremost Clean Energy maintains an option from Denison Mines Corp. to earn up to a 70% interest in 10 prospective uranium properties, excluding the Hatchet Lake property where Foremost can earn up to 51%. These properties encompass over 330,000 acres in the uranium-rich Athabasca Basin region of northern Saskatchewan, one of the world's most productive uranium districts. As global demand for carbon-free energy accelerates, domestically mined uranium and lithium are positioned for substantial growth, playing a critical role in clean energy infrastructure development.</p><p>The company's uranium projects span various exploration stages, from grassroots initiatives to properties with significant historical exploration and drill-ready targets. Foremost's mission focuses on making substantial discoveries alongside Denison through systematic and disciplined exploration programs. The latest developments and corporate updates are available through the company's newsroom at <a href="https://ibn.fm/FMST" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://ibn.fm/FMST</a>.</p><p>This strengthened partnership comes at a pivotal time for the clean energy sector, where reliable domestic supply chains for critical minerals like uranium and lithium are becoming increasingly important for energy security and decarbonization goals. The transaction demonstrates how established mining companies are forming strategic alliances to capitalize on the growing demand for materials essential to nuclear power and battery technologies.</p>
