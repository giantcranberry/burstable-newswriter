<p>Item by Item (IBI), a leading provider of online training for Microsoft Dynamics 365, has launched a new Change Management curriculum that represents the first training program in the market designed to fully integrate change management and user training into D365 project planning. This comprehensive curriculum addresses the human side of ERP and CRM implementations, an area where projects frequently encounter challenges that can derail success.</p><p>The curriculum helps organizations tackle the critical adoption challenges that often cause technology implementations to falter. It provides project teams, business leaders, and change champions with the knowledge and tools needed to drive real adoption, reduce resistance, and set users up for long-term success. The program includes 37 micro-courses covering the full lifecycle of change in a D365 rollout, along with six structured learning paths aligned with roles and project phases.</p><p>To ensure practical application, the curriculum features six assessment tests to reinforce learning and measure progress, plus over a dozen downloadable templates that help teams apply their learning immediately. The content follows a fictional example company throughout its implementation journey, using a storytelling approach that brings concepts to life and demonstrates how change management strategies unfold in real-world scenarios.</p><p>Elif Item, Founder and CEO of Item by Item, emphasized the program's significance, stating that this represents the first attempt to bring change management, training, and project planning together in the D365 space. The Change Management curriculum is available as a standalone offering requiring a separate subscription and can be purchased by both new and existing customers through their platform at <a href="https://www.itembyitem.co" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.itembyitem.co</a>.</p><p>Item by Item maintains the largest user-focused online training platform for Microsoft Dynamics 365, with thousands of users across industries having trained on their platform to gain practical, role-based knowledge. The company's comprehensive training ecosystem includes over 1,300 micro-courses, more than 90 learning paths, and 220+ assessments covering Finance, Supply Chain, Commerce, Sales, Customer Service, Field Service, and now Change Management.</p><p>For business leaders implementing Microsoft Dynamics 365, this curriculum addresses a critical gap in traditional ERP and CRM deployment strategies. By focusing on the human element of technology adoption, organizations can potentially reduce implementation failures, improve user acceptance rates, and maximize return on investment. The integration of change management principles directly into project planning represents a significant advancement in how enterprises approach digital transformation initiatives.</p><p>The timing of this launch coincides with increasing recognition that technology implementations often fail due to human factors rather than technical limitations. As more organizations undergo digital transformation, the ability to manage organizational change effectively becomes a competitive differentiator. This curriculum provides a structured framework for ensuring that technology investments translate into measurable business outcomes through improved user adoption and reduced resistance to change.</p>
