<p>AIRO Group Holdings, Inc. (Nasdaq: AIRO) has signed a non-binding letter of intent with Nord Drone LLC to establish a strategic joint venture focused on accelerating the deployment of combat-proven unmanned aerial systems to the United States, Ukraine, and other NATO member countries. The partnership aims to enhance AIRO's defense and aerospace portfolio by integrating Nord Drone's high-volume, battlefield-proven drone systems into its platform.</p><p>Under the proposed arrangement, AIRO will contribute manufacturing oversight, R&D resources, government procurement leadership, and strategic corporate support. Nord Drone will provide proprietary drone technologies, production facilities, supply chain access, and coordination with defense ministries, including Ukraine's Ministry of Defense. This collaboration combines AIRO's U.S.-based manufacturing infrastructure and expertise in government procurement with Nord Drone's scalable production capabilities and combat-tested technologies.</p><p>Nord Drone currently manufactures approximately 4,000 drones per month, with the ability to scale up to 25,000 units with additional government support. The company produces a wide range of battlefield-proven drones including first-person view strike units, loitering munitions, and multi-role bombers. Flagship models like the NORD-10 and NORD-15 offer up to 15 km range, 4.5 kg payloads, and advanced GPS/GLONASS/BeiDou navigation systems. Nord Drone designs its own flight controllers, ESCs, and video systems, delivering high performance and modularity.</p><p>AIRO's RQ-35 Heidrun has demonstrated battlefield effectiveness with hundreds of thousands of flight hours across its deployed fleet, featuring advanced autonomous navigation, real-time ISR capabilities, and proven survivability in high-threat, GNSS/GPS-denied environments. The partnership with Nord Drone would expand AIRO's reach into adjacent battlefield applications and reinforce its position as a comprehensive provider of next-generation unmanned systems to global defense clients.</p><p>Dr. Chirinjeev Kathuria, Executive Chairman of AIRO, stated that this strategic partnership represents a significant opportunity to deliver proven, battlefield-tested technology to allies when they need it most. The joint venture is intended to serve urgent operational needs across key defense markets, supporting both immediate conflict response and long-term modernization initiatives. Yevgen Kotukh, CTO of Nord Drone, emphasized that the collaboration will enable expansion of combat-proven technologies to serve U.S. and NATO forces while leveraging established manufacturing infrastructure.</p><p>The LOI is non-binding, and execution of definitive joint venture agreements is subject to customary conditions, including the completion of mutual due diligence and regulatory review processes. Both companies have agreed to use good faith efforts to negotiate definitive documentation within 60 days, though there is no assurance that such documentation will be entered into on the terms described or at all.</p>
