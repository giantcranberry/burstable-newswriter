<p>Laura Myres has established Therapeutic Massage Fort Worth within the Salon & Spa Galleria at 6351 Oakmont Blvd., marking a professional homecoming to the location where she began her career. With more than 25 years of experience and specialized training in multiple massage modalities, Myres brings extensive knowledge to identify problem areas and customize each session to individual client needs.</p><p>Therapeutic massage should be carefully designed to alleviate pain, improve emotional well-being, and help relieve stress, according to Myres. Rather than focusing on one specific massage style per session, she relies on client requests and physical assessment of muscle tension. Through questioning and observation of what she terms angry muscle groups, Myres tailors services for optimal outcomes while ensuring massage remains therapeutic rather than painful.</p><p>Myres offers a range of pressure levels, from light touch equivalent to the weight of a nickel to deeper firm pressure as needed to address underlying muscles. The studio operates regularly Tuesday through Friday, with special Saturday and Monday appointments available by advance arrangement. While walk-ins are accepted, appointments are strongly recommended to guarantee availability.</p><p>By leasing an upscale suite in one of the numerous Salon & Spa Galleria locations throughout Tarrant County and Parker County, Myres joins a community of independent beauty and wellness professionals offering specialized services in private, luxurious settings. The <a href="https://www.salonandspagalleria.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Salon & Spa Galleria website</a> details opportunities for professionals seeking Fort Worth beauty salon suite rentals across their 22-location network. The <a href="https://www.salonandspagalleria.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">salon's website</a> provides additional service information for prospective clients.</p><p>Myres returns to the Oakmont Blvd Salon & Spa Galleria where she began her career early on, completing what she describes as a full circle journey. She expressed appreciation for the new management and positive client feedback about the location's energy. This strategic location choice provides established infrastructure and client traffic while allowing Myres to focus on delivering high-quality therapeutic services.</p><p>The business model represents a growing trend in the wellness industry where experienced practitioners establish independent practices within established salon and spa complexes. This approach allows professionals like Myres to maintain autonomy while benefiting from shared amenities and marketing support. For clients, it provides access to specialized services in professional settings without the overhead costs typically associated with standalone practices.</p>
