<p>Bollinger Innovations Inc. will execute a 1-for-250 reverse stock split of its common stock effective September 22, 2025, as the electric vehicle manufacturer seeks to maintain its Nasdaq listing compliance. The reverse split, approved by stockholders on September 11, represents an aggressive move to address the company's stock price challenges and meet Nasdaq's $1.00 minimum bid price requirement.</p><p>The corporate action will automatically convert every 250 shares of common stock into one share, dramatically reducing the outstanding share count from approximately 126.2 million to about 505,000 shares. Trading will continue on Nasdaq under the ticker symbol BINI on a split-adjusted basis beginning September 22, with a new CUSIP number of 62526P877 assigned to the restructured shares. The company has committed that this will be the final reverse stock split initiative for at least the next three years, providing shareholders with some certainty regarding future corporate actions.</p><p>Bollinger Innovations operates as an electric vehicle manufacturer focusing on commercial EVs with its U.S. manufacturing facility located in Tunica, Mississippi. The company produces the ONE, a Class 1 EV cargo van, and the THREE, a Class 3 EV cab chassis truck, both available for sale in the U.S. market. Its commercial dealer network includes six established partners providing sales and service coverage across key regional markets.</p><p>The company's subsidiary, Bollinger Motors of Oak Park, Michigan, represents the established EV truck division that has achieved significant milestones including the B4 Class 4 electric truck production launch on September 16, 2024. Bollinger Motors has developed an extensive dealer network with over 50 locations across the United States for comprehensive sales and service support.

The drastic consolidation ratio of 1-for-250 underscores the severity of the stock price situation Bollinger Innovations faced, though the company maintains its commitment to long-term growth in the commercial electric vehicle market. For business leaders and investors, this move signals both the financial pressures facing emerging EV manufacturers and the strategic measures companies are taking to preserve market access and investor confidence during industry-wide consolidation periods.</p>
