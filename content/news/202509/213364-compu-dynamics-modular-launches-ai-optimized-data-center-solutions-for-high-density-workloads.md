<p>Compu Dynamics Modular has launched two new modular data center solutions engineered to address infrastructure challenges created by rapid growth in artificial intelligence, edge computing, and hyperscale applications. The CDM L Series is optimized for AI learning and training with ultra-high-density workloads, while the CDM I Series provides an all-in-one solution designed for AI inference at the edge.</p><p>Ron Mann, Vice President of Compu Dynamics Modular, emphasized that traditional data centers are increasingly unable to meet the speed, density, and flexibility requirements of exponentially growing AI workloads. The new platforms ensure customers never have to compromise on performance or scalability as AI continues to push infrastructure limits. Both series handle 50â€“250+ kW per rack, with the L Series scalable from 1.5 to 3+ MW and featuring dual-module architecture for next-generation AI applications.</p><p>The CDM I Series supports up to 500 kW per module with air cooling and 1+ MW with combined air and liquid cooling, making it ideal for telecom, healthcare, education, and government sectors requiring compact, efficient edge deployments. Both platforms offer fast deployment, seamless scalability, and technology neutrality, supporting multiple IT hardware and infrastructure OEM equipment sources without vendor lock-in.

The company provides full-service, end-to-end support from evaluation to delivery and ongoing preventive maintenance, accelerating deployment while reducing costs through their turnkey and vendor-neutral approach. This launch positions CDM to help customers face the AI era with confidence in their infrastructure capabilities.</p>
