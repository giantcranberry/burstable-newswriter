<p>DVDFab has launched its 23rd anniversary release with significant upgrades to its DVD, Blu-ray, and 4K UHD processing suite, featuring AV1 encoding support, enhanced copy protection handling, and expanded macOS compatibility. The update positions the software as a comprehensive solution for modern media preservation and conversion needs, addressing the growing demand for efficient video compression without compromising quality.</p><p>The DVDFab Ripper now supports AV1 output in MP4 and MKV containers for DVD and Blu-ray content, providing efficient high-quality SDR encoding. For UHD content, the software offers native AV1 HDR10 output, alongside improvements to subtitle OCR accuracy and the addition of 100 new device presets for streamlined conversion workflows. These enhancements are crucial for businesses and professionals managing large media libraries who require optimized storage solutions while maintaining playback quality across diverse devices.</p><p>DVDFab Copy maintains its focus on reliable 1:1 cloning and smart compression capabilities, with continued updates to handle new Java-based copy protections, including recent releases from specialized markets. The software ensures compatibility with current disc formats while preserving menu structures and content integrity, which is essential for archival purposes and content distribution workflows.</p><p>The Creator module now integrates a built-in video editor with trimming, cropping, effects, and audio adjustment capabilities. Blu-ray Creator specifically adds new themed menu templates for weddings, birthdays, and travel content, reducing setup time while maintaining professional results. These tools support proper BDMV and VIDEO_TS structure creation for reliable playback on standalone players, benefiting content creators and production houses requiring efficient authoring solutions.</p><p>New AI-powered modules include the AI Upscaler and AI HDR Upconverter, designed to enhance image fidelity by cleanly enlarging HD/SD sources and converting SDR libraries to HDR10. The NVIDIA AI Enhancer provides GPU-accelerated processing pipelines that integrate directly with Ripper and Creator modules, offering end-to-end quality improvements for both conversion and authoring workflows. Users can learn more about these features at https://www.dvdfab.cn/.</p><p>Mac users gain significant parity with the introduction of UHD Creator for Mac, enabling true 4K Blu-ray authoring from various 4K formats that maintain compatibility with standalone UHD players. Additional macOS utilities include Blu-ray to UHD Converter and UHD to Blu-ray Converter, bringing cross-standard conversion and authoring workflows natively to Apple's platform for mixed-OS professional environments. This expansion addresses the increasing need for cross-platform compatibility in media production and preservation workflows.</p><p>The anniversary release represents DVDFab's ongoing commitment to adapting to evolving media formats and user needs, combining traditional disc processing capabilities with modern AI enhancement tools and expanded platform support. These developments are particularly relevant as content preservation and format conversion requirements continue to grow in both professional and consumer markets, offering businesses and technology leaders advanced tools for managing digital media assets efficiently.</p>
