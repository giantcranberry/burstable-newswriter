<p>Rosso Development, Midtown Development, and Proper Hospitality have revealed the interior design vision for Midtown Park Residences by Proper's public spaces, created by acclaimed New York-based Meyer Davis Studio. The 28-story tower represents the first residential building within the transformative $2 billion Midtown Park master-planned community, featuring 288 residences integrated with activated parks, curated retail, gourmet restaurants, cafes, and an ULTRA racquet and padel club.</p><p>Meyer Davis, led by Will Meyer and Gray Davis, has crafted spaces that embody Proper Hospitality's sophisticated, layered aesthetic while maintaining deep connections to Miami's local character. We envisioned a dynamic connection between the city and home to create a thoughtful living experience throughout the communal areas that reflects the area's energy and character, said Will Meyer, Co-Founder of Meyer Davis Studio. The result is a timeless environment that feels both purposeful and inviting, where every space reflects a careful balance of comfort, functionality, and true sense of place.</p><p>The design draws inspiration from Miami's natural light and landscape while aligning with the project's broader vision of community and lifestyle. Meyer Davis conceived interiors that blend elegance with warmth, transitioning seamlessly from open, social settings to more tranquil retreats. Natural stone, warm wood, plaster finishes, and greenery form the foundational design palette, complemented by sculptural furnishings and artful accents that bring Proper's signature individuality to each space.</p><p>Carlos Rosso, Founder and CEO of Rosso Development, emphasized the project's community-focused approach. Midtown Park Residences by Proper is about creating a lifestyle and sense of community that extends beyond the walls of each home, Rosso stated. Every space has been designed to inspire connection, wellness, and a true enjoyment of Miami living, with elevated design that reflects a meticulous attention to detail in every corner of the project.</p><p>The residential experience begins with a dramatic 16-foot-high lobby gallery that bridges the vibrant energy of Midtown's streetscape while showcasing museum-quality art. Meyer Davis layered the space with travertine and flagstone floors echoing Miami's natural language, offset by polished surfaces and mirrored bronze columns that create depth and contrast. Seating areas transition from intimate library nooks and custom banquettes to plush velvet and mohair lounge chairs paired with stone tables, while green mosaic-lined planters draw the landscape indoors and sculptural pieces serve as focal points.</p><p>Residents will have access to extensive amenities including a 40,000 square foot tropical pool deck with a signature restaurant and bar overlooking panoramic skyline and water views. Wellness offerings feature a state-of-the-art fitness center, dedicated Pilates studio, tranquil yoga and meditation garden, two private pickleball courts, and a spa pool. Additional social areas include a gourmet coffee bar, events lounge, private party room, kids club, virtual golf simulator and screening room, co-working space, and a communal vegetable garden designed by Naturalficial.</p><p>Located at 3055 N Miami Avenue, Midtown Park Residences by Proper stands steps from the Miami Design District and Wynwood, positioned at the center of one of Miami's most connected neighborhoods.
