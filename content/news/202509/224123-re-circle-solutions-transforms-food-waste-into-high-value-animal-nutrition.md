<p>Clemens Stockreiter, Founder and CEO of RE:CIRCLE Solutions Inc., has reimagined traditional waste management by creating what he describes as an industrial nutrition facility rather than a conventional recycling operation. The company's Ontario facility processes 100 tons of pre-consumer food waste daily from grocers and food processors, employing PhD nutrition scientists who analyze every inbound shipment to determine optimal feed formulations.</p><p>Unlike traditional waste management companies that focus on disposal, RE:CIRCLE transforms organic waste into high-value animal feed products while targeting zero waste to landfill. The company's approach represents a fundamental shift from treating waste as something to eliminate to extracting maximum nutritional value before materials reach consumers. Stockreiter emphasizes that they're not in the disposal business but in the business of transforming waste streams into reliable nutrition for livestock while significantly reducing carbon emissions.</p><p>The company's TraceOS system provides full traceability for organic waste streams, helping large retailers and food processors meet California's SB 1383 requirements. The technology offers auditable documentation with complete tracking of inbound and outbound weights plus real-time calculation of emissions avoided for every shipment. For companies like major retailers, this provides competitive advantage by demonstrating exactly how much waste they've diverted from landfills and quantifying their carbon impact reduction.</p><p>RE:CIRCLE's nutrition scientists review every inbound shipment to analyze nutritional composition and determine optimal feed formulations. The team creates customized blends for cattle, swine, and anaerobic digestion applications based on specific nutritional profiles received each day. The facility currently produces two main feed blend types with several proprietary formulations in development, including liquid blends. This precision nutrition approach allows maintaining consistency despite supply chain variability.</p><p>The company's expansion strategy focuses on perfecting their scalable model in California before expanding elsewhere. The Ontario facility was designed with replication in mind, already having a second depackaging line ready for deployment. Stockreiter describes their approach as copy and paste scalability once the complete business model, technology platform, and scientific expertise are established.</p><p>RE:CIRCLE's model contributes to the circular economy by repurposing waste into products with measurable nutritional and environmental value rather than simply diverting it. Unlike composting or anaerobic digestion, which often represent the end of the line for waste streams, their approach keeps organic resources in play at their highest possible value. This cuts emissions on two fronts: preventing methane from landfills and displacing carbon-intensive feed production.</p><p>For companies rethinking sustainability strategies, partnering with RE:CIRCLE represents value creation versus cost management. While traditional waste management treats organic waste as a cost center, RE:CIRCLE transforms it into a revenue-generating asset while delivering superior environmental outcomes. Clients gain complete traceability through TraceOS, quantifiable emissions reductions, and the ability to demonstrate circular economy leadership rather than basic compliance.</p>
