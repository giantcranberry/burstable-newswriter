<p>PowerBank Corporation (NASDAQ: SUUN) has secured site control for two new solar energy projects in the northeastern United States, marking another step in the company's expansion of its renewable energy portfolio. The developments include a 2.8 MW solar project in upstate New York and a 3.16 MW project in Pennsylvania, both now progressing to the interconnection study phase before construction can begin.</p><p>The Day Hollow, New York project represents significant local energy potential, capable of supplying enough electricity to power approximately 374 homes. According to the company release available at <a href="https://ibn.fm/f8teZ" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://ibn.fm/f8teZ</a>, this project is expected to qualify under New York's Value of Distributed Energy Resources (VDER) program, which compensates distributed energy resources for their value to the grid and the environment.</p><p>The Pennsylvania project's development is contingent upon the final approval of House Bill 1842, legislation that would authorize community solar programs throughout the state. This legislative dependency highlights how state energy policies directly influence renewable energy development and investment decisions across the industry.</p><p>These new projects contribute to PowerBank's growing portfolio, which now exceeds 100 MW of developed renewable energy projects with a pipeline surpassing 1 GW. The company's strategy focuses on creating value for all stakeholders by building its portfolio of cash-generating independent power producer assets for recurring revenue or completing strategic project sales.</p><p>As a premier developer and owner of renewable and clean energy projects specializing in distributed and community solar initiatives throughout Canada and the U.S., PowerBank continues to expand its North American footprint. The company's forward-looking statements and additional details are available at <a href="https://ibn.fm/xDPgd" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://ibn.fm/xDPgd</a>.</p><p>The expansion into these northeastern markets demonstrates the ongoing growth of distributed solar energy infrastructure and reflects how energy companies are responding to state-level renewable energy incentives and programs. These developments contribute to regional clean energy goals while providing PowerBank with additional revenue-generating assets in its expanding portfolio.</p>
