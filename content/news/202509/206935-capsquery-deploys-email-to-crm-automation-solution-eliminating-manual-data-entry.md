<p>Capsquery Private Limited has successfully designed and deployed a smart automation solution that connects email data directly to client CRM systems, eliminating the need for time-consuming manual entry. The system addresses the challenge of increasing email data volume, including bids and proposals, which previously required manual reading and entry into CRM portals.</p><p>The automation solution uses IMAP library technology to directly link client mailboxes, automatically scan each received email, extract critical data such as bid amounts and proposal details, and maintain CRM portal data in real-time. The Capsquery technical team implemented a cron job to run the procedure at regular intervals, ensuring continuous operation without disrupting existing infrastructure.</p><p>The results demonstrate significant efficiency improvements, with hours of manual work reduced to minutes per day. The automated extraction method has eliminated errors associated with manual data entry while requiring no infrastructure overhaul, as the solution adapts automatically to PHP/WordPress settings. This allows clients to focus on strategic business aspects rather than routine administrative tasks.</p><p>This development showcases Capsquery's expertise in creating customized web solutions, serving businesses in Texas, London, and beyond. The company continues to assist clients in focusing on strategic growth while technology manages routine operations. Capsquery delivers a wide range of custom web development services with built-in security, smooth user interfaces, and quick-loading platforms, serving various sectors including e-commerce, healthcare, SaaS, shipping, and education.</p><p>The company maintains strict security standards in all development work, with Director Anand Gupta emphasizing that security means creating systems that keep working under stress. Capsquery develops web solutions adhering to best cybersecurity practices, ensuring websites can handle real dangers while supporting business growth.
