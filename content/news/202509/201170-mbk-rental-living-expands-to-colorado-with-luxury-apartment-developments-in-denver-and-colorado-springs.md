<p>MBK Rental Living has launched its inaugural Colorado projects with luxury apartment communities in Denver and Colorado Springs, marking a strategic expansion into the Western U.S. market after operating exclusively in California for over a decade. The developer collaborated with joint venture partners on both properties, which opened this summer amid strong leasing activity and community interest.</p><p>Alexan Pe√±a Station in Northeast Denver, developed with Trammell Crow Residential and Tokyo Tatemono, comprises 578 units across 14 buildings on a 20-acre site. The community features one- to three-bedroom floor plans ranging from 686 to 1,350 square feet, alongside extensive amenities including two resort-style pools, clubhouses, co-working offices, community garden plots, and a beer garden. Centered around a two-acre public park with dog parks and a pickleball court, it offers walkability to urban conveniences and transportation access to Denver International Airport via public transit options.</p><p>The Aven in Colorado Springs, developed with Hines, includes 284 units on 9.7 acres, featuring one- to three-bedroom layouts from 606 to 1,429 square feet with unobstructed mountain views. Amenities encompass a clubhouse with resort-style pool, co-working spaces, fitness center, and dog park. Situated in the desirable Briargate neighborhood, it provides proximity to premier shopping, top-rated schools, and outdoor amenities like parks and trails, with easy access to Highway I-25 and Mountain Metro Transit.</p><p>Ken McCarren, President of MBK Rental Living, emphasized Colorado's dynamic market appeal and the company's focus on enriching resident lives through personalized amenities and gathering spaces. He indicated potential for additional projects in Colorado and other Western U.S. states based on current leasing success. This expansion aligns with MBK's broader portfolio, which includes several California communities and plans for three new developments by early 2026.</p><p>The move addresses growing demand for luxury rental housing in high-growth regions, leveraging partnerships with established firms like Hines and Trammell Crow Residential to enhance market penetration and investor returns. This expansion strategy demonstrates how real estate developers are targeting secondary markets with strong economic fundamentals and population growth, potentially signaling increased competition and investment opportunities in the Western U.S. multifamily housing sector.</p>
