<p>Pvolve, the clinically-backed functional fitness franchise, has signed its first franchise agreements in the Las Vegas suburbs, marking the brand's entry into the Nevada market. Jennifer LaFrance, a business leader in Las Vegas, will open two new studios in the Summerlin and Henderson neighborhoods, bringing the brand's science-backed approach to functional fitness to the growing Nevada community.</p><p>LaFrance, a lifelong fitness enthusiast and 16-time marathon finisher, brings both personal passion for wellness and extensive business experience to her role as Pvolve's first Las Vegas franchisee. Fitness has always been an essential part of my life, LaFrance stated. Pvolve's science-backed, low-impact method aligns perfectly with my personal wellness goals, and I'm thrilled to bring this empowering approach to the Las Vegas community.</p><p>The expansion represents a strategic move for Pvolve into one of the nation's fastest-growing metropolitan areas. Julie Cartwright, President of Pvolve, emphasized the strategic fit, noting Vegas is a dynamic, fast-growing city hungry for innovative fitness experiences, and Pvolve is uniquely positioned to deliver just that. Jennifer LaFrance's combination of business acumen, ambition and community ties gives us tremendous confidence in our impact here.</p><p>Pvolve's innovative approach combines functional movement with resistance equipment to improve strength, mobility, and injury prevention. The brand's hybrid model offers in-studio classes, streaming options, and proprietary at-home equipment, allowing members to engage with the brand through multiple access points. This multi-channel approach aims to create long-term wellness habits that extend beyond traditional fitness programs.</p><p>Once open, the Summerlin and Henderson locations will provide residents access to Pvolve's clinically-backed workouts, hybrid membership options, and innovative resistance equipment. LaFrance has already been using Pvolve's at-home equipment and online platform personally and expressed enthusiasm for building a local community focused on sustainable wellness practices.</p><p>The Nevada expansion comes as Pvolve continues its national growth strategy. Franchise opportunities remain available in high-growth U.S. markets, including Texas, Florida, North Carolina, and other major metropolitan areas. The company seeks both single- and multi-unit operators who share its passion for health, wellness, and community building.
