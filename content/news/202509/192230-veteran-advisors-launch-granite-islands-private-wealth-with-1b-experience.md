<p>Charles Andriole and Robert DeLucca, financial advisors with extensive experience at major firms, have launched Granite Islands Private Wealth, LLC, an independent advisory firm based in Guilford, Connecticut.

Gaudioso CFP®, C(k)P®, CRPS® as Wealth Advisor and Retirement Plan Advisor with over 25 years of experience. The team is supported by <a href="https://truindependence.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://truindependence.com</a>, an established leader in the wealth management industry that provides robust infrastructure, compliance, technology and operational support.</p><p>DeLucca emphasized the firm's client-centric philosophy, noting that everyone on the team is unified by a commitment to deliver an unparalleled standard of care through deep-rooted values.
