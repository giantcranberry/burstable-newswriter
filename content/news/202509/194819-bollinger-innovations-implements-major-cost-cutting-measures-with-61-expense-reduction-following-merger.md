<p>Bollinger Innovations (NASDAQ: BINI) has implemented significant staff reductions and facility eliminations as part of ongoing consolidation efforts following its recent merger. The electric vehicle manufacturer reported general and administrative and research and development expenses of $47.7 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2025, but has successfully reduced those costs to $18.6 million per quarter, representing a 61% decrease in operational expenses.</p><p>The cost-cutting measures include eliminating facilities in Irvine and Monrovia, California, and Mishawaka, Indiana, ending third-party manufacturing with Roush Industries, and consolidating B4 production to its company-owned plant in Tunica, Mississippi. CEO and Chairman David Michery stated that these streamlined operations will support the company's focus on commercial EV sales, including its Class 1 cargo van, Class 3 cab chassis truck, and Class 4 B4 Chassis Cab, all of which comply with federal safety, EPA, and CARB standards.</p><p>The company's commercial dealer network currently consists of seven dealers, including Pap√© Kenworth, Pritchard EV, National Auto Fleet Group, Ziegler Truck Group, Range Truck Group, and Randy Marion Auto Group. These partnerships provide sales and service coverage in key West Coast, Midwest, Pacific Northwest, New England, and Mid-Atlantic markets, ensuring comprehensive support for commercial customers adopting electric vehicle technology.</p><p>Bollinger Motors, an established EV truck company under the Bollinger Innovations umbrella based in Oak Park, Michigan, has achieved significant milestones including its B4 Class 4 electric truck production launch on September 16, 2024. The company has developed a world-class dealer network with over 50 locations across the United States for sales and service support, positioning it for broader market penetration. Additional information for investors is available through the company's <a href="https://ibn.fm/BINI" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">newsroom</a>.</p><p>These consolidation efforts represent a strategic shift for the electric vehicle manufacturer as it adapts to evolving market conditions and focuses resources on its core commercial vehicle offerings. The substantial cost reduction and operational streamlining demonstrate the company's commitment to financial sustainability while maintaining regulatory compliance across all product lines, potentially setting a precedent for other EV manufacturers facing similar market pressures.</p>
