<p>KBR, Inc. has announced a unanimous board decision to pursue a tax-free spin-off of its Mission Technology Solutions segment, creating two independent public companies with enhanced focus and growth potential. The separation, targeted for completion by mid-to-late 2026, aims to unlock shareholder value by allowing both entities to pursue distinct market opportunities with greater operational independence.</p><p>According to Stuart Bradie, KBR Chair, President, and Chief Executive Officer, this decision represents a pivotal milestone in the company's evolution. After the spin-off, both companies are expected to retain key elements of KBR's unique values-driven culture and proven execution approach, providing a strong foundation for future profitable growth and returns. The spin-off is designed to create two pure-play companies that can better capitalize on their respective market positions and growth trajectories.</p><p>The newly structured KBR, referred to as New KBR, will focus on Sustainable Technology Solutions, leveraging its portfolio of over 85 process technologies in areas including ammonia/syngas, chemical/petrochemicals, clean refining, and circular economy markets. This entity will concentrate on proprietary technologies that reduce emissions and advance energy transition, supported by what the company describes as strong secular trends in sustainable technology adoption. New KBR is expected to benefit from low capital intensity and robust free cash flow generation.</p><p>The spin-off company, designated as SpinCo, will operate the Mission Technology Solutions business, focusing on government contracts aligned with national security and space priorities. SpinCo will maintain its capital-light business model with diversified, long-duration contracts and predictable cash flow. The company has a history of successful acquisitions that have expanded its capabilities and customer base, positioning it to leverage growing government budgets in its target markets. Additional information about KBR's operations can be found at <a href="https://www.kbr.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.kbr.com</a>.</p><p>Executive leadership changes accompany the spin-off plan, with current CFO Mark Sopp transitioning to oversee the separation process. Shad Evans, currently SVP of Financial Operations, has been appointed as KBR's new Chief Financial Officer effective January 5, 2026, and will assume the CFO role for New KBR post-spin. The board has engaged a search firm to identify executive leadership for SpinCo, ensuring both companies have dedicated management teams aligned with their specific strategic objectives.</p><p>The transaction structure aims to be tax-free for KBR and its shareholders, pending final board approval and regulatory conditions including SEC registration and IRS rulings. KBR has reaffirmed its fiscal year 2025 outlook, indicating confidence in the separation process not disrupting current operations. Financial advisors Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC and legal counsel from Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr LLP and Baker & McKenzie LLP are supporting the transaction, which represents one of the most significant corporate restructuring moves in the engineering and technology services sector.</p><p>This strategic separation allows both entities to sharpen their focus on core competencies while responding more effectively to evolving market demands. For New KBR, the pure-play structure enables deeper investment in sustainable technology innovation as global energy transition accelerates. SpinCo gains the flexibility to pursue government contracts without competing for resources against commercial technology initiatives, potentially enhancing its competitive positioning in the national security and space sectors.</p><p>The spin-off's timing aligns with growing investor appetite for focused business models and comes as both sustainable technology and government services markets experience significant growth. The transaction's tax-free structure provides additional value preservation for shareholders while the maintained fiscal outlook demonstrates operational stability throughout the transition period.</p>
