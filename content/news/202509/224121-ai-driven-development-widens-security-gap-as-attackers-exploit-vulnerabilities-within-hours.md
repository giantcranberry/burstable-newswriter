<p>The cybersecurity industry faces critical challenges as artificial intelligence accelerates both software development and cyber attacks, creating a dangerous gap between code deployment and vulnerability exploitation. According to Ohad Cohen, Chief Revenue Officer at <a href="https://ox.security" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">OX Security</a>, security teams confront three fundamental problems: the speed disparity between development and security cycles, overwhelming signal-to-noise ratios in security alerts, and tool sprawl across multiple security solutions.</p><p>Cohen explained that while developers now ship code faster than ever with AI assistance, attackers exploit vulnerabilities just as quickly, compressing the window from code commit to compromise to mere hours. Most security teams still operate on weekly cycles with manual processes, creating a dangerous risk gap where breaches thrive. The situation worsens as security teams drown in alerts without knowing which ones matter for their specific environment, while organizations deploy separate solutions for SAST, SCA, DAST, cloud, containers, and APIs without meaningful consolidation.</p><p>Application security has become a priority because applications and APIs represent the new perimeter, Cohen emphasized. Attackers no longer need network access when they can target vulnerable dependencies or logic bugs in critical business functions. The business impact is direct, with app outages or data leaks affecting revenue, customer churn, and brand reputation. Boards increasingly demand evidence of actual risk reduction tied to revenue protection rather than compliance checklists that keep auditors happy but don't prevent breaches.</p><p><a href="https://ox.security" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">OX Security</a> has experienced explosive growth, tripling its customer base and reaching $10 million in revenue within a year while serving over 200 leading organizations including Microsoft, IBM, Intel, eToro, and SoFi. The company recently secured $60 million in funding led by DTCP with participation from IBM Ventures, Microsoft, Swisscom Ventures, Evolution Equity Partners, and Team8. Cohen attributes this momentum to OX's differentiated approach focused on cutting noise, proving risk reduction, and helping developers fix issues quickly.</p><p>Looking ahead, Cohen identified several trends in application security, including the shift from alert fatigue to measurable outcomes, code-to-runtime graphs becoming the source of truth, and agentic AI moving beyond chatbots to actively fix security issues. The evolution from SBOM to PBOM with runtime context represents a significant advancement, allowing organizations to understand which packages and services are actually exposed in production environments. Consolidation into unified AppSec control planes is accelerating, with single platforms now handling multiple security functions under one risk model.</p><p>As Cohen takes on the CRO role, his priorities include scaling OX globally through repeatable outcomes rather than headcount growth. The strategy involves standardizing code-to-runtime visibility, evidence-based prioritization, AI remediation, and deep integrations with platforms like GitHub, GitLab, and Jira. Pricing must map directly to value with transparent units tied to active builders and protected services, making adoption and expansion predictable for customers.</p><p>For other sales leaders in cybersecurity, Cohen advises focusing on selling outcomes rather than fear, demonstrating closed attack paths and reduced mean time to resolution. Deal discipline requires time-boxed proof of concepts with specific KPIs and mutual action plans with clear ownership. The most effective sales approach involves creating compelling board stories focused on risk reduction, time savings, and cost savings rather than technical features.</p>
