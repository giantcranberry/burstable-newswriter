<p>BPS Lawyers has been named the full-service law partner of UConn Athletics, establishing a strategic alliance between the Connecticut law firm and the university's nationally recognized athletic program. This partnership represents a significant alignment of Connecticut-based institutions with shared values and community connections that extends beyond traditional corporate sponsorship.</p><p>The law firm brings nearly 50 years of legal experience to the partnership, with offices spanning Glastonbury, Hartford, New Hartford, Simsbury, and Essex. BPS Lawyers provides comprehensive legal services across multiple practice areas including personal injury, criminal law, family law, civil litigation, trust and estates, and real estate matters. The firm's attorneys practice throughout Connecticut, many of whom are University of Connecticut alumni themselves, creating natural alignment with the athletic program.</p><p>UConn Athletics maintains a prominent national profile with 21 athletic teams and 25 total national championships. The program's recent successes include the women's basketball team winning the 2025 National Championship, marking their 12th championship title, while the men's basketball program has secured six national championships including back-to-back wins in 2023 and 2024. The athletic department emphasizes a culture built on teamwork, uncompromising effort, and high achievement standards that prepare student-athletes for success beyond sports.</p><p>The partnership holds particular significance given the strong UConn connections within BPS Lawyers. Managing partner Nicholas Paindiris is a University of Connecticut School of Law graduate, and numerous other attorneys in the firm share similar educational backgrounds with the university. This shared institutional affiliation creates deeper connections between the organizations beyond typical business arrangements.</p><p>University of Connecticut alumnus Trent LaLima expressed enthusiasm for the collaboration, stating that having rooted for the UConn Huskies throughout his life made this partnership a meaningful opportunity to support the program in a new capacity. Similarly, Stephen Sobin, a graduate of the University of Connecticut School of Law, highlighted the excitement within the firm about supporting the Huskies and anticipating a productive partnership.</p><p>For business and technology leaders observing this alliance, the partnership demonstrates how local businesses can strategically support educational and athletic institutions that shape future leaders. The collaboration between a established legal practice and a premier athletic program showcases how professional services firms can extend their community engagement beyond traditional philanthropy. This model of institutional partnership may influence how other businesses approach supporting local educational and athletic programs, particularly those with shared alumni connections and community values.</p><p>The alliance represents more than simply corporate sponsorship, instead reflecting a deeper connection between two Connecticut institutions that both emphasize excellence and community engagement. BPS Lawyers has maintained its commitment to Connecticut communities since its establishment in 1977, while UConn Athletics has developed countless young athletes who contribute to society both during and after their sporting careers. This partnership underscores the importance of local businesses supporting educational and athletic institutions that shape Connecticut's future leaders.</p>
