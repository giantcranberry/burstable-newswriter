<p>Captain Steel India Ltd. has unveiled Captain RustGuard TMT, a new reinforcement bar engineered specifically to address the persistent problem of rust corrosion in India's coastal regions and humid interiors. The product features a fusion-bonded epoxy coating that creates a protective barrier against moisture and salt penetration, targeting what the company describes as the "silent killer of buildings."</p><p>According to Mr. Avinash Agarwalla, Director of Captain Steel India Ltd., the development responds to the premature deterioration of structures caused by preventable rust damage. "We asked ourselves: what if we could create a TMT bar that actively fights back? Captain RustGuard is our answer," Agarwalla stated. The company emphasizes that this innovation represents more than just selling steelâ€”it's about providing long-term security for residential and infrastructure projects.</p><p>The technical specifications of Captain RustGuard TMT include a high strength-to-weight ratio that enables architects to design more ambitious structures without being constrained by heavy materials. The bars also feature high bendability, allowing construction workers to handle them more efficiently on-site, potentially reducing labor time and effort. These characteristics maintain the performance standards expected from Captain Steel's existing product line while adding corrosion resistance.</p><p>Builders and homeowners in moisture-prone areas can expect several key benefits from the new product. The specialized epoxy shield prevents rust initiation, making it suitable for projects exposed to salt, humidity, or industrial pollutants. The company claims the technology can radically extend building lifespans, protecting investments across generations. Additionally, the product enables leaner construction designs that use less steel while maintaining structural integrity, potentially leading to more cost-effective building solutions.</p><p>The launch reinforces Captain Steel India Ltd.'s position as an innovative leader in India's construction materials sector, focusing on addressing practical challenges faced by builders in environmentally demanding regions. The product development reflects the company's commitment to creating solutions that contribute to safer and more durable infrastructure nationwide.</p>
