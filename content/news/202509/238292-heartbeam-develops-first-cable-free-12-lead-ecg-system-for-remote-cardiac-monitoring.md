<p>HeartBeam is addressing significant limitations of traditional 12-lead electrocardiogram systems by developing the first cable-free, high-fidelity ECG system that captures the heart's electrical signals from three distinct directions. This technology synthesizes the signals into a comprehensive 12-lead ECG, enabling thorough arrhythmia assessment outside conventional clinical environments. The system's breakthrough capability to provide accurate cardiac monitoring beyond healthcare facilities represents a fundamental shift in how heart conditions can be detected and managed.</p><p>The HeartBeam System's compact design, approximately the size of a credit card, emphasizes user friendliness and portability that traditional 12-lead ECG systems lack. Patients can easily use the device at home or while traveling by simply placing it on their chest for 30 seconds to capture ECG data. This streamlined process allows for secure transmission of cardiac information to on-call cardiologists for professional review, facilitating timely medical interventions when necessary. The technology addresses a critical gap in current cardiac care approaches by making comprehensive monitoring accessible outside medical facilities.</p><p>This platform technology represents the first-ever cable-free 12-lead ECG capable of capturing the heart's electrical signals from three dimensions, delivering actionable heart intelligence wherever the patient is located. Physicians utilizing this system can identify cardiac health trends and acute conditions while directing patients to appropriate care without requiring physical presence in medical facilities. The technology's potential to redefine cardiac health management stems from its ability to provide professional-grade monitoring in non-clinical settings, potentially improving early detection and management of heart conditions.</p><p>HeartBeam's intellectual property portfolio includes substantial protection for its innovative technology, with 13 U.S. and 4 international-issued patents related to technology enablement.
