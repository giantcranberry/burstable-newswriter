<p>The Supervisory Board of R. STAHL AG has established a gradual, structured handover of company management, marking a significant leadership transition for the industrial technology firm. Effective 1 October 2025, Dr. Claus Bischoff will be appointed as an additional member of the Executive Board and Deputy CEO, positioning him to assume full leadership responsibilities.</p><p>Dr. Mathias Hallmann will retain his duties as CEO until the end of 2025 and will provide support during the transition process before stepping down from his position and leaving the company at his own request as of 31 December 2025. This resolution was passed in accordance with his longstanding service contract as Chairman of the Executive Board, which was scheduled to end on 30 September 2026. The Supervisory Board had already identified Dr. Bischoff as a successor through strategic succession planning, demonstrating proactive corporate governance.</p><p>Dr. Bischoff brings many years of management experience with international companies in the automotive, electronics, mechatronics and automation technology sectors. He holds a doctorate in engineering and was most recently CTO at automation specialist Lenze SE. His career began after studying mechatronics and automation at Robert Bosch GmbH, where he gained extensive professional experience that will be valuable in his new role at R. STAHL AG.</p><p>Further career milestones included positions as Managing Director and CTO at mechatronics specialist Marquardt GmbH, where he was responsible for development, sales and business units. Dr. Bischoff has also held senior positions at Continental AG and Magna International AG, bringing diverse industry expertise to his new role that spans multiple technology sectors critical to industrial automation.</p><p>Peter Leischner, Chairman of the Supervisory Board, stated that the transition aligns with the consistent application of the corporate strategy adopted by the company. Dr. Hallmann has worked to reposition R. STAHL over the past eight years, successfully guiding the Group through various crises and laying the foundation for profitable growth. The leadership change ensures continuity in the company's direction while bringing fresh perspectives to its technological development and global operations.</p><p>With Dr. Bischoff, the company has found an experienced successor who, as a strong leader with deep expertise in technology, product development and operational transformation, will continue to drive the strategic process forward together with Tobias Popp (CCO), the R. STAHL leadership team, and the entire workforce. This transition represents a carefully planned evolution rather than a disruptive change, which is crucial for maintaining stability in the competitive industrial technology market where R. STAHL operates.</p>
