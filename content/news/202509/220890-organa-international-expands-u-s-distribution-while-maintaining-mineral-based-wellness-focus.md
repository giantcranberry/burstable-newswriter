<p>ORGANA International has announced plans for expanded U.S. distribution while maintaining its commitment to mineral-based health products derived from decomposed plant matter. The company's products are currently available on <a href="https://www.amazon.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Amazon</a>, providing consumers with convenient access as the company prepares new distribution partnerships.</p><p>CEO Larry Mills emphasized ORGANA's mission to provide what nature already offers. With today's food supply often lacking vital nutrients, our products help restore what's missing so that people of all ages—children, athletes, families, seniors—can live healthier lives, Mills stated. The company maintains a customer-first philosophy and has earned a 5-star rating from the Better Business Bureau.</p><p>The company's flagship multi-mineral drink remains central to its product line, which has expanded to include flavored mineral beverages in cherry, wildberry pomegranate, and peach mango varieties. Additional offerings include magnesium cream for muscle support, liquid oxygen supplements, silver-based immune support, and Essiac tea for detoxification. All products use pharmaceutical-grade water and natural ingredients to ensure bioavailability and safety.</p><p>ORGANA's distinctive approach involves testing products under a microscope for Brownian movement, indicating that particles remain active and alive. With a particle size of just 20 nanometers, the minerals can penetrate skin barriers and reach cellular levels, allowing efficient absorption while enabling the body to safely excrete unnecessary components. This natural derivation contrasts with many synthetic supplements on the market.</p><p>Mills measures success not merely by sales figures but by customer feedback. It's when a mother tells us her child feels better, or when an athlete shares that recovery is easier with our products. That's the real reward, he explained. The company backs every purchase with a satisfaction guarantee, reinforcing its commitment to customer satisfaction.</p><p>While ORGANA has maintained steady growth through its Amazon presence, the upcoming expansion aims to make products more accessible to consumers across the United States. Mills affirmed, Our goal is to put ORGANA into the hands of more people who can benefit from it. Once they try it, they understand the difference. Many of our customers become customers for life. Additional details regarding distribution partnerships will be announced in the coming months.</p>
