<p>Rosso Commercial Real Estate has facilitated the sale of Georgetown Plaza, a 40,000 square foot mixed-use property at 914 Bay Ridge Road in Annapolis, Maryland, for approximately $4.9 million. The transaction closed on August 29, 2025, representing the first change in ownership for this neighborhood center in decades.</p><p>Located along the heavily traveled Forest Drive corridor, Georgetown Plaza has served the Annapolis Neck â€“ Bay Ridge Peninsula community for more than 30 years. The property features a diverse mix of tenants including Main & Market, Domino's, Annapolis Family Dentistry, and several other established businesses that have made it a cornerstone of the local retail landscape.</p><p>John Rosso, Principal of Rosso Commercial Real Estate, noted that the property's excellent location, strong tenancy, and decades-long reputation attracted the new ownership. The firm has handled leasing efforts at Georgetown Plaza since 2018 under prior ownership and represented the seller in this off-market transaction through agents Ryan Brassel and Ross Westholm.</p><p>The new ownership has retained Rosso Commercial as the exclusive leasing agent for the property, ensuring continuity in management and operations. This arrangement maintains the established relationships with current tenants and preserves the property's role as an important part of Annapolis' retail and service environment. The transaction demonstrates ongoing investor interest in well-located, established commercial properties with strong tenant mixes in the Mid-Atlantic region.</p>
