<p>Executive Chairman Cevdet Caner and Chief Executive Officer Richard Bunning announced the formation of Global Critical Resources Corporation, a U.S.-registered company operating the Minera Tres Valles copper mine in Chile and Tataki Mine nickel, cobalt, and platinum group metal asset in Botswana. The company aims to address the world's rapidly growing demand for resources essential to advanced technologies, electric vehicles, and renewable energy.</p><p>GCR Group's team brings decades of experience in mining critical minerals, leveraging knowledge of political risk, complex transactions, operations, and advanced technology to identify investment opportunities and create value. "Together with our partners and stakeholders, GCR Group delivers integrated mining solutions that combine cutting-edge methods with a commitment to responsible production," said CEO Richard Bunning, emphasizing the company's approach of revitalizing high-potential assets rather than building from scratch.</p><p>The company operates with a strong sustainability focus, adhering to the highest environmental, social, and governance standards. Executive Chairman Cevdet Caner stated, "At our core, we believe investing in critical minerals is not just a strategic opportunity to secure crucial supply chains and propel innovation, but it's also a generational chance to accelerate development in communities endowed with these resources."</p><p>Minera Tres Valles, located near Salamanca in Coquimbo, Chile, features an advanced underground mine utilizing Incline Block Caving extraction methods and an open-pit mine planned for development within three years. The facility contains 8.2 million tons of proven and probable reserves and produces Grade-A 99.999% pure electrolytic copper cathodes, among the highest quality in the market. Production is expected to reach 5,000 tons of cathodes in the first year of GCR Group's ownership, increasing to approximately 13,000-15,000 tons annually from 2026.</p><p>Tataki Mine in Botswana's North-East district near the Zimbabwe border contains one of the country's largest reserves of nickel, copper, cobalt, and platinum group metals. After reopening under GCR Group leadership, the mine will produce various metals and hydroxide salts for international markets. Chief Operating Officer Lukasz Abramowicz noted that Tataki is expected to generate over $4.2 billion in revenue over the next decade and contribute a 1.5% increase in annual GDP to Botswana.</p><p>The formation of Global Critical Resources represents a significant development in the global critical minerals supply chain, particularly as demand for these materials continues to grow with the expansion of electric vehicle production and renewable energy infrastructure worldwide. This strategic move addresses critical supply chain vulnerabilities while supporting the global transition to clean energy technologies.</p>
