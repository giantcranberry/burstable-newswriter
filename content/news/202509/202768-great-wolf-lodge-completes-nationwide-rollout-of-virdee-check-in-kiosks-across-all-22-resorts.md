<p>Virdee, Inc., a leader in digital check-in and guest experience technology for hospitality, has completed a nationwide rollout of specially designed check-in kiosks for Great Wolf Lodge across all 22 of its indoor water park resorts. The implementation represents a significant advancement in streamlining the guest arrival experience, allowing visitors to check in either at in-lobby kiosks or through pre-arrival options on mobile web or the brand's mobile app.</p><p>Each property now features Virdee-powered kiosks with integrated RFID wristband dispensers that serve multiple functions. These wristbands act as room keys, waterpark passes, and cashless payment devices for food and beverage purchases, creating a seamless experience throughout the guest journey. The system currently processes over one million check-ins annually across the Great Wolf Lodge portfolio.</p><p>Ramki Srinivasan, Chief Digital & Information Officer at Great Wolf Lodge, emphasized the company's commitment to making the arrival experience as convenient as possible. With Virdee's platform, we've been able to reduce congestion during peak arrival times, enhance guest satisfaction, and empower our front desk team to focus on hospitality rather than transaction processing, Srinivasan stated.</p><p>The automated system has achieved substantial adoption rates, with approximately 50% of arriving guests currently using the Virdee check-in system, increasing to 70% on peak days. The technology also enables guests to purchase additional amenities such as attraction passes and late check-out options, creating a comprehensive one-stop shop for the full arrival experience.</p><p>An additional feature includes Virdee's support for over 38,000 Room Ready Notifications per month. This functionality allows guests to check in before their room is ready and begin enjoying resort amenities, including access to the indoor water park. Guests receive digital notifications when their room becomes available, eliminating the need to return to the front desk or kiosk.</p><p>Branigan Mulcahy, CEO and co-founder of Virdee, highlighted the operational benefits, noting that by removing friction from both the physical and digital check-in process, we've helped Great Wolf Lodge eliminate peak-time lines, drive upsell revenue and measurably improve both guest NPS and front desk employee satisfaction. The successful nationwide deployment further establishes Virdee as a leading digital front desk partner for the hospitality industry.</p>
