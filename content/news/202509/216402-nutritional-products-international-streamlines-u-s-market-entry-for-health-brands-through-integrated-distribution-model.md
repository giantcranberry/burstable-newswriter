<p>International health and wellness brands face substantial barriers when attempting to enter the competitive U.S. retail market, but Nutritional Products International has developed a comprehensive solution through its Evolution of Distribution model. Founded by retail veteran Mitch Gould, NPI functions as a single-source partner that combines regulatory expertise, logistics support, and retail relationships into one integrated service package.</p><p>The U.S. market presents unique challenges that companies frequently underestimate, requiring navigation of both distinct retail culture and regulatory agencies like the FDA. Gould emphasized that his company created a system that brings every necessary component together, eliminating the need for brands to manage multiple partners. The Evolution of Distribution model integrates sales, marketing, logistics, and regulatory expertise into a streamlined process that handles everything from importation to retail placement.</p><p>NPI's regulatory capabilities include a food scientist with extensive FDA experience who ensures product compliance, while logistics professionals coordinate overseas shipping and customs clearance before products arrive at the company's Florida warehouse. Once products are in the United States, NPI's sales team promotes and places them with major retailers, e-commerce platforms, and distribution partners nationwide. Gould's decades of experience include visiting headquarters and procuring orders from retailers including Costco, Sam's Club, Home Depot, Lowe's, CVS, Walgreens, Rite Aid, Kmart, Target, Walmart, and 7-Eleven.</p><p>These longstanding retail relationships have enabled Gould to place hundreds of products into some of the most recognized retailers in the country. His firsthand knowledge of how America's largest retailers operate provides international companies with crucial guidance through the complexities of U.S. distribution. Recognizing that new brands often cannot afford traditional marketing agencies, Gould also launched InHealth Media, NPI's in-house marketing arm that specializes in high-impact campaigns across digital, social, influencer, and retail-focused media.</p><p>The combined approach has proven successful by delivering cost-efficiency alongside speed-to-market advantages. Gould's career includes visits to nearly every major retail headquarters in the United States and placement of hundreds of products on store shelves and online platforms. International brands require more than just a distributor according to Gould—they need a partner that understands how to succeed in America, which is precisely what NPI delivers through its integrated approach.
