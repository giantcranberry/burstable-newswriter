<p>Auvik has unveiled new innovations designed to bring greater clarity, efficiency and simplicity to overwhelmed IT professionals through enhanced network and SaaS management capabilities. The company introduced Smart Alert Suppression for Auvik Network Management (ANM), designed to surface intelligent and relevant insights with more precision while reducing alert noise, alongside a streamlined client dashboard for Auvik SaaS Management (ASM) that efficiently maps relevant information into a single, unified view for enhanced workflows.</p><p>These developments address the growing complexity of IT environments with hybrid work models and expanding SaaS portfolios, where teams face mounting pressure to manage more devices and applications with fewer resources. John Astorino, Chief Operating Officer at Auvik, stated that these enhancements equip today's thinly-stretched IT teams with more actionable insights and a comprehensive view of network alerts to help teams more efficiently address pain points and time-sensitive alerts.</p><p>The Smart Alert Suppression solution provides more intuitive alerting by greatly reducing alert noise and only surfacing mission-critical insights. Paired with Auvik's network mapping capabilities, this automated functionality brings added clarity to network outages, eliminating redundant alerts related to downstream devices and giving technicians more relevant topology insights.</p><p>The unified SaaS Management client dashboard uncovers potential areas of shadow IT and cost savings by displaying activities across applications in one control center, including security, expenditure, provisioning, and usage insights. These workflow enhancements provide seamless navigation and oversight as IT teams juggle an increasing number of SaaS applications.</p><p>According to Alex Arcilla, Principal Analyst at Enterprise Strategy Group, Auvik Network Management eliminates the need for organizations to manually stitch together a comprehensive network view by combining the capabilities of multiple point tools. The automation used to generate a complete network view, including endpoints such as remote users and IoT devices, eliminates the need to manually create network asset inventory and mapping.
