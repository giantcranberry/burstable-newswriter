<p>International technology consultancy AND Digital has appointed Kenn van Hauen as Chief AI Officer, a strategic move that positions the company to lead clients through the critical transition from AI experimentation to enterprise-scale implementation. Van Hauen, who previously served as Vice President and Head of Industries for Professional Services EMEA at <a href="https://www.salesforce.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Salesforce</a>, will lead AND Digital's AI, Automation, and Intelligent Systems Practice Area while overseeing the evolution of expertise across all strategic disciplines.</p><p>In his dual role, van Hauen will drive AND Digital's Practice Areas model, the company's approach to building deep, differentiated expertise across strategic capabilities. He will ensure these practices align with market opportunities and client needs while championing the development of next-generation skills, accelerators, and intellectual property that enable AND Digital's clubs to deliver exceptional client outcomes. His appointment comes at what van Hauen describes as a critical inflection point in AI adoption.</p><p>Van Hauen emphasized the shifting landscape of artificial intelligence implementation, stating that organizations are realizing that success requires more than just access to the latest models. He noted that true enterprise-scale AI demands deep expertise in implementation, cost optimization, and building the contextual infrastructure that makes AI systems actually useful at scale. This perspective highlights the growing recognition that AI's potential can only be realized through disciplined execution and strategic infrastructure development.</p><p>The appointment reflects AND Digital's commitment to differentiation through expertise as the company continues its international growth since its founding in 2014. Paramjit Uppal, CEO and Founder of AND Digital, highlighted that van Hauen's unique combination of strategic vision and delivery credibility, proven across both consulting and technology leadership roles, makes him ideal for ensuring the company stays ahead of technological change rather than merely keeping pace.</p><p>Van Hauen brings an extensive career spanning Capgemini, Salesforce and PA Consulting, with a proven track record of delivering transformational change across diverse industries. His specialization in initiatives that enhance customer experience, unlock operational efficiencies, and strengthen corporate decision-making aligns with the current market demand for practical AI applications that deliver measurable business outcomes. His experience working with organizations such as British Airways, Nike, Sky, and Subway through AND Digital's unique model provides valuable insight into scaling digital capabilities across enterprise environments.</p><p>The strategic importance of this appointment extends beyond AND Digital's immediate operations to the broader technology consulting landscape. As organizations increasingly seek to move beyond pilot programs to build intelligent systems that deliver sustainable, measurable impact, the need for specialized AI leadership becomes paramount. Van Hauen's focus on connecting technology to customer value, building sustainable AI economics, and creating orchestration infrastructure addresses fundamental challenges facing businesses attempting to scale AI initiatives effectively.</p><p>This development signals a maturation in the AI consulting market, where expertise in implementation and scaling is becoming as valuable as technical knowledge of AI models themselves. For business leaders evaluating AI strategies, van Hauen's appointment underscores the importance of focusing on practical implementation frameworks and cost management alongside technological capabilities. The move also highlights the growing recognition that successful AI adoption requires bridging the gap between experimental projects and production-ready systems that can operate reliably at enterprise scale.</p>
