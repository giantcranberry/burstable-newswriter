<p>Big Dawg Party Rentals, a Brooklyn-based event rental company, has received dual recognition from Inc. magazine, being named to both the <a href="https://www.inc.com/inc5000" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Inc. 5000</a> list of fastest-growing private companies in America and the Inc. Best Workplaces 2025 list. This simultaneous achievement highlights the company's ability to combine substantial business growth with a positive organizational culture, setting a benchmark in the event rental sector.</p><p>Founder and CEO Brendan Quinlan emphasized the significance of this dual honor, stating that while the company takes pride in serving Fortune 500 companies, global brands, and major sporting events, the internal culture remains their defining characteristic. Growth means nothing without people, Quinlan noted, underscoring the company's commitment to maintaining an employee-first environment that fosters innovation, loyalty, and operational excellence.</p><p>The recent accolades follow other notable achievements for both the company and its leadership. Quinlan was previously recognized with the American Rental Association's 12 Under 40 Award, which spotlights emerging industry leaders across North America, Canada, and Europe. Additionally, Big Dawg secured a position in the Cuse 50 Awards, a global recognition of the fastest-growing businesses led by Syracuse University alumni.</p><p>Big Dawg Party Rentals provides equipment and services for thousands of events annually, including weddings, cultural festivals, large-scale corporate activations, and headline sporting events. The company has built its reputation on reliability, scalability, and client-first execution, establishing itself as one of the most trusted partners in the event industry. This dual recognition from Inc. magazine not only validates their business model but also demonstrates that rapid growth and positive workplace culture can coexist successfully in competitive markets.</p><p>For business leaders and technology professionals, Big Dawg's achievement serves as a compelling case study in balancing aggressive expansion with employee satisfaction. The company's success challenges the conventional wisdom that rapid growth often comes at the expense of workplace culture, offering valuable insights for organizations navigating competitive landscapes while maintaining their core values and employee engagement.</p>
