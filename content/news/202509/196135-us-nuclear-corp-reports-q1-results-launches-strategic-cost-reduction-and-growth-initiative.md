<p>US Nuclear Corp has filed its first quarter financial statements and expects to submit second quarter results later this week, with trading resumption anticipated shortly after review completion. The company reported implementing significant operational changes, including closing its Los Angeles facility and consolidating all operations and financial reporting at its Overhoff facility in Ohio.</p><p>President Bob Goldstein stated that the company has strengthened financial reporting by adding a staff accountant and implementing a streamlined system to produce audit-ready monthly reports. The first quarter results showed a loss from operations of $523,880, which included a non-cash charge of $451,459 for incentive warrants. Adjusted for this charge, the operating loss would have been $72,421, representing a 50% reduction from the $144,429 operating loss reported a year ago.</p><p>The company has launched Project 2036, a strategic initiative targeting a 20% reduction in monthly expenses while increasing sales by 36% annually. According to Nikki Truax, Director of Operations for Overhoff Technology, this growth plan involves expanding the sales team and distributor network, establishing consistent monthly customer outreach through prospect mailings, and participating in trade shows. The initiative focuses on top-selling products using volume pricing strategies complemented by bundling with new products.</p><p>US Nuclear Corp maintains significant investments in the nuclear fusion sector, including over 600,000 shares in MIFTI, an early-stage company developing a thermonuclear fusion-powered reactor. The company also owns over 14% of radionuclide technology company MIFTEC and holds a 35.2% interest in Grapheton, Inc., which designs and manufactures advanced energy storage devices called supercapacitors. Goldstein expressed confidence that these investments could become valuable within the next 18 months.</p><p>The first quarter financial results are available through the company's <a href="https://www.usnuclearcorp.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">official website</a>. The company expects to show growth in sales and progress toward profitability by the fourth quarter, despite disruptions caused by the facility consolidation and staffing reductions during the reporting period.</p>
