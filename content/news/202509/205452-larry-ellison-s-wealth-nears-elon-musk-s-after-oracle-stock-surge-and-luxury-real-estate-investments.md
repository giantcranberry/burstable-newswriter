<p>Larry Ellison, co-founder and chief technology officer of Oracle Corp., is narrowing the wealth gap with Elon Musk as his net worth surged to an estimated $364 billion following Oracle's extraordinary stock performance. The <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/billionaires" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Bloomberg Billionaires Index</a> shows Ellison now trails Musk's estimated $384 billion by just $20 billion after Oracle shares rose more than 29% in a single day, potentially marking the largest single-day wealth increase in the index's history.</p><p>While Ellison's Oracle stake remains the cornerstone of his fortune, his strategic investments in South Florida's luxury hospitality sector are becoming increasingly significant. In August 2024, Ellison's Lawrence Investments entity acquired the Eau Palm Beach Resort & Spa for approximately $277 million. The 309-room oceanfront property spans eight acres in Manalapan, Florida, featuring spa facilities, meeting space, restaurants and expansive guest accommodations.</p><p>The resort, originally founded as La Coquille Club in the 1950s as an elite retreat for families like the Vanderbilts, Rockefellers and Fords, later operated as a Ritz-Carlton before rebranding as Eau Palm Beach in 2013. Ellison plans further enhancements while retaining the current management team to ensure operational continuity.</p><p>Beyond the hotel acquisition, Ellison owns a private 16-acre estate in Manalapan purchased for $173 million in 2022, setting a Florida record for the most expensive home sale. The property offers both beachfront and lakefront access with a network of tunnels connecting across A1A. Combined, Ellison has deployed over $450 million in Manalapan real estate since 2022, transforming the small town of approximately 400 residents into an enclave for the ultra-wealthy.</p><p>Ellison's investments have catalyzed a broader real estate boom as affluent buyers including CEOs, celebrities and high-net-worth individuals flock to the area. Luxury residential listings now reach hundreds of millions of dollars, including a spec mansion listed for $285 million featuring amenities like bowling alleys, golf simulators and ocean-to-Intracoastal tunnels. Even modest estate listings carry multimillion-dollar price tags, with some properties offering complimentary membership to Ellison's resort.</p><p>Industry observers note these investments are reshaping Manalapan's social and real estate fabric while demonstrating Ellison's keen sense of upscale lifestyle trends. His broader hospitality portfolio includes luxury properties such as the Four Seasons Resort Lanai, Sensei Lanai in Hawaii, Nobu Ryokan Malibu, Nobu Hotel Palo Alto, Hyatt Regency Lake Tahoe and Sensei Porcupine Creek in California.</p><p>As Oracle shares continue climbing and his hospitality investments deepen, Ellison's influence extends beyond software and servers into curated private estates, legendary hotels and luxury enclaves that may ultimately eclipse his technology fortunes.</p>
