<p>Bennelong Funds Management has partnered with US-based Monroe Capital through a memorandum of understanding to expand distribution of private credit solutions to Australia and New Zealand. This collaboration marks Bennelong's strategic transition from primarily equities-based offerings to diversified asset classes that address evolving investor requirements.</p><p>Monroe Capital, a $21.6 billion asset manager specializing in diversified private credit solutions, focuses on US lower middle market direct lending to institutional and high-net-worth investors. The firm's investment strategy centers on first lien and unitranche loans to companies across multiple industries throughout the US and Canada. Gillian Larkins, Chair of the Bennelong Funds Management Ltd Board, stated that this alignment represents the third step in transforming Bennelong into a business that better serves investor needs by augmenting Australian capabilities with international specialists across established asset classes.</p><p>John Burke, CEO of Bennelong Funds Management, emphasized Monroe Capital's position as a top ten US non-bank lender in 2024, noting the firm's proven expertise and scale in offering valuable private credit alternatives to local investors. The partnership enables Bennelong to continue servicing its client base while meeting their evolving investment needs through access to specialized international management. Alex Kim, Managing Director & Head of APAC at Monroe Capital, highlighted the characteristics of the US middle market lending universe, which includes over 200,000 companies and features less competition, more covenants, and higher spreads than other direct lending areas.</p><p>This fragmentation in the lower middle market, where Monroe Capital specializes, provides investors access to market segments offering potential for higher returns and enhanced downside protection. Zia Uddin, President of Monroe Capital, described the launch of their private credit strategy through Bennelong's Australian-domiciled fund as a pivotal step in democratizing access to institutional-grade credit strategies. The partnership opens opportunities for qualifying investors to participate in a resilient asset class that has historically delivered stable income and downside protection.</p><p>Monroe Capital maintains over 300 employees, including approximately 120 investment professionals focused on deal sourcing and underwriting, with headquarters in Chicago and 12 locations across the United States, Asia, Middle East and Australia.
