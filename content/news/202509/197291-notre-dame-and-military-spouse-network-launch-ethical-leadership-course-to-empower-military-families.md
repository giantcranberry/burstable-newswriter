<p>The Military Spouse Advocacy Network's partnership with the University of Notre Dame has launched its second online course, titled Ethical Leadership with Notre Dame, following the successful July introduction of a mental wellness program. This new offering represents a collaboration between Notre Dame Learning's Office of Digital Learning and faculty from the Notre Dame Deloitte Center for Ethical Leadership at the Mendoza College of Business, reflecting the center's mission to inform, equip, and inspire values-based leadership.</p><p>The course covers critical topics including conflict management, voicing values at work, and honesty and empathy in decision-making, with the specific aim of supporting military spouses in becoming leaders who foster resilient and flourishing communities. Both non-credit courses are delivered through a mix of asynchronous content and live sessions, making them accessible to military families who often face relocation challenges and career disruptions.</p><p>Jessica McManus Warnell, Rex and Alice A. Martin Faculty Director of the Notre Dame Deloitte Center for Ethical Leadership, explained the program's significance. The course includes contributions from Notre Dame faculty members Paul Blaschko, Jim Leady, Drew Marcantonio, and Jim O'Rourke, along with military community members Rose Boyle, Pat Gibbons, Jen Heckel, Amy Spangler, and Erin Stevens.</p><p>The impact of the initial mental wellness course has demonstrated the program's effectiveness. This multidisciplinary partnership involves faculty and staff from 10 organizations across Notre Dame, spearheaded by Notre Dame Research with support from multiple university departments including the Office of Military and Veterans Affairs and the College of Arts and Letters.</p><p>The program addresses the unique challenges military spouses face in maintaining career continuity and leadership development despite frequent relocations and the demands of military life.
