<p>Centcore, a division of Mitesco, Inc., has formed a strategic partnership with Sportzfolio, LLC to launch an innovative Pickleball Properties Listing & Marketing Platform designed to meet the surging demand in the nation's fastest-growing sport. The digital hub will connect property owners, developers, municipalities, and investors with real estate suited for pickleball courts, centers, and multi-use facilities.</p><p>The platform operates strictly as a marketing and advertising service rather than a brokerage, providing a safe and cost-effective way to showcase properties without commission-based risks. With tiered listing options, streamlined intake processes, and integrated digital marketing campaigns, the solution aims to become the central destination for the pickleball real estate market. Brian Valania, General Manager of Centcore, emphasized that "This is more than a listing site - it's an engine for exposure and growth."</p><p>The platform offers free listings with basic property data and photos, tiered paid listings with vetted summaries and lead tracking, marketing bundles for added reach, referral opportunities with licensed professionals, and advertising slots for vendors and partners. Centcore's enterprise-grade infrastructure ensures reliability and security, while Sportzfolio brings sports-focused market development expertise to the partnership.</p><p>Dave Conord, CEO of Sportzfolio, LLC, noted that "Pickleball is more than a sport - it's a cultural shift that's driving demand for new spaces and new opportunities. By teaming up with Centcore, we can deliver a platform that is secure, scalable, and built to serve the long-term needs of this industry." The collaboration represents Sportzfolio's mission to empower growth in sports through innovative partnerships, extending into one of the fastest-growing recreational markets in the country.</p><p>With over 36 million U.S. participants in 2024 and rising numbers, pickleball continues to fuel demand for dedicated courts, training centers, and lifestyle-oriented facilities. The Centcore-Sportzfolio platform is designed to help stakeholders identify opportunities, drive visibility, and accelerate project execution in this rapidly evolving space, laying the digital foundation for pickleball's next decade of expansion.</p>
