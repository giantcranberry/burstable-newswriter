The company's guiding principle, "Transforming Transportation Together. For a sustainable world," underscores its commitment to environmental responsibility while pursuing commercial growth. Having a finance and operations specialist like Dr. Antlitz on the supervisory board could enhance TRATON's ability to balance sustainability objectives with financial performance, particularly as the industry undergoes significant technological transitions toward electrification and alternative fuels.</p><p>Further information regarding Dr. Antlitz's professional background and additional board mandates is available on the <a href="https://www.traton.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">TRATON website</a> under the section detailing supervisory board composition.
