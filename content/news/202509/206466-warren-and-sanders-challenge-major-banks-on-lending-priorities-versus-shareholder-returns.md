<p>Senator Elizabeth Warren and Senator Bernie Sanders have called out the country's biggest banks, saying they are putting profits for shareholders and executives ahead of the needs of everyday Americans. In a joint move, the two senators wrote letters to the Chief Executive Officers of the top six banks urging them to lend more to households and businesses instead of focusing on dividends and stock buybacks.</p><p>The senators' action raises important questions about how financial institutions balance their responsibilities to shareholders with their role in supporting economic growth through accessible credit. Their intervention comes at a time when many Americans continue to face challenges securing financing for homes, education, and small business ventures.</p><p>It remains to be seen what other financial industry players like B. Riley Financial Inc. think of how the pair of U.S. senators is interpreting the practice of share buybacks and issuing dividends by major banking institutions. The broader financial community's response to this political pressure could signal shifting expectations for corporate behavior in the banking sector.</p><p>For more information about financial news coverage, visit <a href="https://BillionDollarClub" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">BillionDollarClub</a>, a specialized communications platform focused on major companies.
