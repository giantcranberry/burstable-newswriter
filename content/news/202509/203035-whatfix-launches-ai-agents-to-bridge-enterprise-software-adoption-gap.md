<p>Whatfix has launched AI agents integrated throughout its product suite to enhance user productivity and drive measurable business performance outcomes. These agents leverage ScreenSense, Whatfix's proprietary AI technology that continuously interprets both the user's context within applications and their real-time intent to deliver timely, relevant actions.</p><p>According to Khadim Batti, CEO and Co-Founder of Whatfix, many organizations face a growing gap between software's potential and real user impact as AI investments increase across the enterprise software stack. The layer of AI is adding to rapid change, risking paralyzing users with too much change and too little guidance. Whatfix AI Agents aim to adapt to the user's context rather than requiring users to adapt to technology.</p><p>The initial three Whatfix AI Agents—Authoring, Insights, and Guidance—are now available across the Whatfix product suite. The Authoring Agent simplifies content creation by generating fully configured in-app experiences using natural language prompts, enabling non-technical staff to publish guidance content at scale. The Insights Agent provides a conversational interface for analyzing product analytics data, allowing stakeholders to ask questions in natural language to uncover user behavior patterns and identify areas needing improvement.</p><p>The Guidance Agent delivers precise, AI-generated answers within the workflow, distilling complex information into contextual summaries without requiring users to switch applications or read lengthy documentation. These agents are embedded across Whatfix's Digital Adoption, Product Analytics, and Mirror platforms, creating an intelligent layer that personalizes user interactions.</p><p>Laurentiu Bogdan, Operational Excellence Director at Servier, commented that with Whatfix AI, the industry is heading towards a world where digital solutions will self-correct, self-improve, and personalize in real time based on user intent. The technology represents more than just automation—it's about making complexity disappear for end-users.</p><p>Whatfix is expanding its AI-first products based on its Userization philosophy, which focuses on putting technology in service of the user. The company has received industry recognition, including winning the <a href="https://aibreakthroughawards.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">2025 AI Breakthrough Award</a> as "Overall AI-based Analytics Solution of the Year" and being shortlisted for the AI Awards for "Best Use of AI for Learning." The expansion reflects the growing need for solutions that help enterprises maximize their software investments as organizations struggle to turn increasing technology spending into tangible business outcomes.</p>
