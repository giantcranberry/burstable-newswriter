<p>Glassonic has received U.S. Patent No. 12,395,784 B2 for its glass-based wireless speaker system that utilizes a uniquely curved panel to produce full-range audio from a single structural element. The patent, granted on August 19, 2025, covers a speaker design featuring a glass panel that widens at the base and gradually narrows toward the top, with three strategically placed slots near the top to reduce mass and optimize resonance characteristics.</p><p>The patented geometry creates a frequency gradient along the panel where low frequencies resonate more prominently near the base, mid-range frequencies in the middle section, and high frequencies toward the top. This natural acoustic distribution eliminates the need for traditional multi-driver enclosures while delivering what the company describes as room-filling sound. According to the patent documentation available at <a href="https://www.uspto.gov" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.uspto.gov</a>, the innovation lies in the precise mass-tuning of the glass panel through its curved geometry and strategic slot placement.</p><p>This approach allows the single glass structure to handle the full audio spectrum without requiring separate woofers, tweeters, or mid-range drivers typically found in traditional speaker systems. The design platform is scalable, meaning the geometry and slotting can be adjusted for different room sizes and acoustic requirements. Nelson Fathollahi, inventor of the system, explained that years of research and development were required to unlock the acoustic potential of glass as a transducer material.</p><p>The technology represents a significant departure from conventional speaker design by transforming glass from primarily decorative material into a functional audio component. The free-standing wireless speakers are designed to integrate seamlessly into contemporary interiors, offering both aesthetic appeal and high-fidelity performance. The patent strengthens Glassonic's intellectual property position as the company advances product development and explores partnership opportunities in the audio technology sector.</p><p>The implications for interior design and audio technology are substantial, as the system offers a minimalist alternative to bulky speaker enclosures while maintaining audiophile-grade sound quality. Glassonic indicates that product timelines, specifications, and pre-order information will be released in the coming months as the technology moves toward commercialization. The patent protection provides the company with exclusive rights to this particular approach to glass-based audio transduction in the United States market.</p>
