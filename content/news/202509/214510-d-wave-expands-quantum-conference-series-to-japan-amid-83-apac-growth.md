<p>D-Wave Quantum Inc. will host its first quantum computing user conference in Tokyo on September 17, 2025, responding to significant growth in quantum technology adoption across the Asia Pacific region. The Qubits Japan 2025 event, themed "Quantum Realized," comes as the company reports an 83% increase in bookings for its annealing quantum computing technology throughout APAC.</p><p>The conference will feature presentations from D-Wave executives, customers, and industry thought leaders showcasing how quantum technology is delivering tangible value today. Presentations will highlight customer success stories, technical roadmap updates, scientific achievements, and advancements in quantum artificial intelligence applications. Organizations across the region are increasingly developing optimization and quantum AI solutions using D-Wave's technology.</p><p>Notable speakers include Dr. Alan Baratz, CEO of D-Wave, who will address the growing commercial applications of quantum computing. The event represents a strategic expansion of D-Wave's user conference series into the Japanese market, reflecting the country's position as a key hub for quantum computing research and implementation in Asia.</p><p>Registration for the conference is available through the official event portal at <a href="https://www.eventzilla.net/e/qubits-japan-25-2138656678" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.eventzilla.net/e/qubits-japan-25-2138656678</a>. The conference timing aligns with increased global investment in quantum technologies, particularly in optimization and AI applications where annealing quantum computers have demonstrated practical advantages over classical computing approaches.</p><p>This expansion into Japan follows D-Wave's established presence in North American and European markets, where the company has hosted similar user conferences. The Asia Pacific region has emerged as a critical growth market for quantum computing technologies, with Japan, China, and South Korea leading research and commercial adoption efforts. The 83% booking increase indicates strong enterprise demand for quantum solutions that can address complex computational challenges in various industries.</p>
