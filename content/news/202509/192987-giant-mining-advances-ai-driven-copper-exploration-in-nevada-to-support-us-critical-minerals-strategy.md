<p>Giant Mining Corp. has commenced its 2025 Phase 2 Exploration Program at the Majuba Hill Copper-Silver-Gold Project in Pershing County, Nevada, building on successful AI-driven drilling results from Phase 1. The program leverages a porphyry-driven, magmatic-hydrothermal breccia model to unlock district-scale potential, positioning Majuba Hill as a potential domestic source of copper essential for electrification, grid modernization, and renewable energy infrastructure.</p><p>The Phase 2 program includes comprehensive surface mapping, core data analysis, and 93 new soil samples to evaluate newly recognized breccia zones. A key component involves deploying ExploreTech's AI-driven geophysical modeling to refine IP/resistivity targets using advanced porphyry-breccia exploration techniques. Final assay results from Phase 1 core hole MHB-36 confirmed the effectiveness of the AI targeting strategy, intersecting numerous intervals of supergene and hypogene copper mineralization, including 1.5 feet at 1.21% copper.</p><p>David Greenway, CEO of Giant Mining, stated that ExploreTech's proprietary geophysical modeling successfully identified high-potential breccia zones, expanding understanding of Majuba's copper mineralization. The AI-driven approach allows the company to utilize extensive property-wide IP/resistivity data to identify geologically favorable zones beyond known mineralization. Consulting Geologist Buster Hunsaker emphasized that the ExploreTech process provides a solid vectoring tool, directly linking copper presence to magmatic-hydrothermal breccias.</p><p>The Majuba Hill project's significance extends beyond technical exploration results. Located in Nevada, ranked #1 in the Fraser Institute's 2022 mining jurisdiction survey, the project benefits from existing infrastructure including roads, power, and water access. With 9,684 acres of mineral rights and approximately 89,395 feet of historical drilling, the project shows indications of a potentially large copper-silver-gold mineralized body with expansion potential in all directions.</p><p>This development comes as the United States accelerates efforts to re-shore critical mineral supply chains, with copper emerging as an indispensable resource for sustainable energy transition. The project's location in a mining-friendly jurisdiction with supportive regulations enhances its potential to contribute to domestic copper production. Giant Mining has secured funding for the next phase of drilling and maintains quality assurance measures through ALS Labs sample analysis following industry best practices.</p>
