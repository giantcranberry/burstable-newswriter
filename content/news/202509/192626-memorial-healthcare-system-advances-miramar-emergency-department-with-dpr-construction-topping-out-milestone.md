<p>DPR Construction has completed the topping out of the first phase of construction for Memorial Healthcare System's new freestanding emergency department in Miramar, Florida. The 16,800-square-foot facility, located at Miramar Parkway and Red Road, represents a significant step toward addressing the healthcare needs of Broward County's expanding community.</p><p>The new emergency department will feature 13 examination rooms, eight fast track rooms, a pediatric treatment area, a trauma/resuscitation room, advanced imaging capabilities including CT and X-ray, and on-site laboratory services. Scheduled to be fully operational by the second quarter of 2026, the facility will serve an area that currently accounts for 27% of Memorial's emergency room volume.</p><p>Memorial Hospital Pembroke CEO Felicia Turnley emphasized the project's importance, noting that with the population projected to increase by 10% by 2029, this new facility will offer convenient access to care and help reduce wait times for emergency services. The strategic location addresses critical healthcare infrastructure needs in one of South Florida's fastest-growing regions.</p><p>DPR Construction's Senior Project Manager Luke Stocking confirmed that the building's topping out will be completed by the end of August, with the project remaining on schedule thanks to strong collaboration with local authorities. Stocking noted that working with the City of Miramar and other local entities has been productive, despite the challenges of developing a previously undeveloped site.</p><p>DPR is simultaneously constructing another freestanding emergency department for Memorial in Pembroke Pines on Douglas Road, also planned to open in 2026. For both projects, DPR has utilized its in-house self-perform team to address ongoing labor challenges and create greater construction efficiencies. Celebrating its 20th anniversary in South Florida, DPR and its more than 100 local employees handle approximately $260 million in construction projects annually throughout Miami-Dade, Broward, and Palm Beach Counties.</p><p>The completion of this healthcare facility represents a crucial investment in community health infrastructure, providing essential emergency services to a growing population while demonstrating effective public-private partnership in addressing regional healthcare needs.
