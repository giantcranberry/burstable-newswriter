<p>G&A Partners has demonstrated a successful growth strategy that has propelled the professional employer organization to support more than 4,400 clients and 120,000 worksite employees nationwide. The Houston-based company, which recently celebrated 30 years in business, has completed 16 acquisitions in the last seven years while maintaining focus on organic growth and client retention as primary drivers.</p><p>President and CEO John W. Allen emphasized that mergers and acquisitions complement rather than replace the company's core growth strategies. There are three main ways for a PEO to grow, with organic growth needing to be the primary driver. The sales organization must consistently seek out new business, while client retention remains equally critical. The company conducts monthly Net Promoter Score and Employee Net Promoter Score surveys, providing continuous feedback that helps improve workplace environment and address client concerns.</p><p>G&A Partners' acquisition strategy includes retaining employees from acquired companies, particularly client-facing staff, to maintain continuity and client satisfaction. Over the past five years, one in four employees has joined the company through acquisition. The company's most recent acquisition of <a href="https://www.growthforce.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">GrowthForce</a> will merge with G&A Partners' outsourced accounting division to form an innovative financial operations platform. The combined team will operate under the GrowthForce brand as a G&A Partners company.</p><p>The company also expanded its human capital management reach with the acquisition of <a href="https://www.amcheck.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">AmCheck Austin</a> and <a href="https://www.amcheck.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">AmCheck Las Vegas</a>, two independently operated payroll franchises. These acquisitions reinforce G&A Partners' commitment to delivering scalable HCM technology to growing businesses nationwide, addressing the burden of manual HR processes that hinder growth and productivity for small to mid-sized businesses.</p><p>Looking ahead, Allen stated that the industry will continue to evolve, and G&A Partners will adapt by focusing on enhancing customer experience and making decisions that prioritize client interests. The company aims to continue growing organically, pursuing strategic acquisitions, and retaining valued clients by delivering innovative solutions that anticipate evolving HR needs. This approach has positioned G&A Partners as a destination workplace with nearly 800 employees committed to helping businesses thrive through smarter insights and streamlined operations.</p>
