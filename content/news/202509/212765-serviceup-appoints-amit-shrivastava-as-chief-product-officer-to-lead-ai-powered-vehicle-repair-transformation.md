His background includes roles at Castlight Health and Intel, providing him with deep expertise in mobile-first, AI-augmented platforms and global product leadership.</p><p>With this hire, ServiceUp gains the exact type of leader who can turn operational complexity into product-led scale, according to Kraig Ward, Managing Director at Bearhug Recruiting. ServiceUp CEO Brett Carlson added that Shrivastava's ability to tackle complex problems and build for scale makes him ideal for the company's current growth phase.</p><p>In his new role, Shrivastava will oversee product, design, and engineering at ServiceUp, working to accelerate delivery, strengthen infrastructure, and scale adoption of the company's AI-powered orchestration platform nationally. The appointment comes as ServiceUp scales toward $100M+ in revenue, backed by $55M in Series B funding from <a href="https://peakspancapital.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PeakSpan Capital</a> and other strategic investors.</p><p>ServiceUp's platform combines software, logistics, and service operations into a single solution that streamlines the entire repair lifecycle from pickup to drop-off.

By leveraging AI, ServiceUp is uniquely positioned to lead that change and build a platform that sets new standards for keeping the world's commercial fleets on the road.</p><p>This executive appointment signals ServiceUp's commitment to leveraging artificial intelligence to transform an industry that has historically been fragmented and inefficient.
