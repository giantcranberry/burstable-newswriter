<p>Corintis has emerged from stealth mode with a $24 million Series A funding round to address what industry experts identify as the next major bottleneck in artificial intelligence advancement: thermal management of high-power computer chips. The funding, led by BlueYard Capital with participation from Founderful, Acequia Capital, Celsius Industries, and XTX Ventures, brings the company's total raised capital to $33.4 million as it scales operations to meet growing demand for advanced cooling solutions.</p><p>The urgency of Corintis's mission is underscored by the exponential growth in AI computational requirements. Where early versions of OpenAI's ChatGPT trained on NVIDIA chips using 400 watts of power, current GPU and AI accelerator designs are approaching 10 times that power consumption, necessitating advanced liquid cooling systems that traditional air cooling cannot provide. NVIDIA's recent adoption of liquid cooling for its latest data center GPUs signals an industry-wide shift toward more sophisticated thermal management solutions.</p><p>Corintis's technological approach centers on microfluidic cooling, which involves designing optimized liquid cooling systems at the micro-scale level specifically adapted to individual chip architectures. The company's breakthrough collaboration with Microsoft has demonstrated the practical viability of this approach, with tests showing their in-chip microfluidic cooling system removes heat three times more effectively than the most advanced cooling technology currently available. This thermal margin translates to significant performance improvements and overclocking potential at the software layer while enabling new 3-D chip architectures previously impossible due to thermal limitations.</p><p>The company's platform bridges the gap between chip design and cooling system engineering through several proprietary technologies. Glacierware automates cooling system design, while their copper microfluidic manufacturing facility produces cold plates with features as small as a human hair. The Therminator platform allows chip companies to physically emulate next-generation chips with millimeter accuracy to validate cooling solutions before production. This integrated approach represents a fundamental shift from treating cooling as an afterthought to making it a core design feature.</p><p>Industry leaders recognize the strategic importance of Corintis's technology. Lip-Bu Tan, Chairman of Walden International and former Intel CEO who has joined Corintis's board as part of the funding round, emphasized that cooling represents one of the biggest challenges for next-generation chips. David Byrd, general partner at BlueYard Capital, noted that AI's insatiable demand for compute is pushing chips to unprecedented power densities, making advanced cooling solutions essential for unlocking the next wave of performance.</p><p>Corintis has already manufactured over ten thousand cooling systems deployed in data centers running leading-edge AI chips, achieving eight-digit cumulative revenue since incorporation. With the new funding, the company plans to expand its team from 55 to over 70 employees by year-end and scale manufacturing capacity to exceed one million microfluidic cold plates annually by 2026. This expansion will position Corintis to play a decisive role in enabling the continued advancement of computational power necessary for AI development, climate modeling, and pharmaceutical research.</p>
