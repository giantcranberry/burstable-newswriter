<p>SRS Real Estate Partners has closed the $20.75 million ground lease sale of a 145,000-square-foot single-tenant property occupied by Target located at 5750 Sunrise Highway in Sayville, NY. The transaction represents the only free-standing Target sale nationally in the past three years, according to Calvin Short of SRS Capital Markets, who represented the seller alongside Jeff Christian of First Street, Inc.</p><p>The property, built in 2014 and situated on 12.14 acres, features approximately 14 years remaining on Target's absolute triple net, corporate-guaranteed lease. The seller was a California-based private investor who had owned the asset for more than 20 years, while the buyer was another California-based private owner who sold out of multifamily investments and was represented by Tyler Leeson and Peter Deltondo at Marcus & Millichap.</p><p>Short noted that the SRS team secured multiple offers, with the majority coming from New York buyers, but ultimately selected the strongest offer from the California buyer. The Target location ranks in the top 10% nationally for the brand according to <a href="https://placer.ai" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Placer.ai</a> data, and the sale terms demonstrate continued demand for top-tier credit in the single-tenant net leased space.</p><p>The property's strategic location contributes significantly to its value, situated in an affluent, dense trade area with high barriers to entry for new development. It is directly across from The Shops at SunVet mall, a Whole Foods and Sephora-anchored redevelopment, and is proximate to Sunrise Highway and major national retail brands including Costco, Home Depot, and Home Goods. Sayville serves as a gateway to Fire Island, a major tourism magnet attracting millions of visitors annually.</p><p>This transaction adds to SRS Capital Markets' impressive year, having completed more than $1.5 billion in deal volume comprised of more than 350 transactions across the nation. The firm currently has in excess of 845 properties actively on the market with a market value surpassing $3.7 billion.
