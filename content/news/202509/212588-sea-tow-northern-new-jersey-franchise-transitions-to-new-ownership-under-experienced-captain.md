<p>Sea Tow Northern New Jersey has transitioned to new ownership under Captain Mike Dudzinski, ensuring continuity of premium on-water assistance services for boaters in the Sandy Hook and Metro New York areas. The franchise, established in 1987, will maintain operations from its strategic base at Bakers Marina on the Bay, with service coverage extending north to the George Washington Bridge.</p><p>Captain Dudzinski brings over 40 years of marine industry experience to his new role, including background as a charter captain, marina employee and investor, and marine electronics installation expert. His lifelong experience as a boat owner provides unique insight into the needs of the local boating community. Dudzinski stated his commitment to upholding the same dedication and delivering the highest standard of care and support that has been established.</p><p>The ownership change represents a significant development for the region's boaters who rely on Sea Tow's comprehensive services. Membership benefits include unlimited boat towing with no distance or dollar limits in a member's home area, fuel delivery, jump starts, covered ungroundings, and scheduled dock-to-dock towing coverage on all covered vessels. Members consistently receive priority service over non-members, available 24/7 through the network's Coast Guard-licensed captains.</p><p>Sea Tow President Kristen Frohnhoefer expressed confidence in the transition, noting that Northern New Jersey boaters can expect the same exceptional service they've always relied on for all their on-water assistance needs. The organization pioneered the on-water assistance concept when the United States Coast Guard ceased response to non-emergency calls and has been the industry leader for over 40 years. Additional services available outside membership include salvage and recovery operations, natural disaster response, and environmental hazard cleanup.</p><p>The franchise continues to operate its purpose-built fleet from strategic positions to best serve members and boaters throughout the Northern New Jersey region.
