<p>Compu Dynamics, a leading provider of data center infrastructure services, announced that President and CEO Steve Altizer will participate in a panel discussion on data center cooling innovations at the Data Center Investment Conference & Expo (DICE): Midwest on September 25, 2025. The conference, organized by Bisnow, will bring together industry leaders including CEOs, investors, engineers, and developers to address emerging trends in data center development.</p><p>The panel titled "Data Center Cooling Innovations: Preparing for the AI Era" will explore how artificial intelligence is transforming cooling requirements for data centers. As AI workloads demand more powerful computing infrastructure, traditional air cooling methods are becoming insufficient for handling the heat generated by high-density AI clusters. The discussion will focus on advanced liquid-based cooling solutions, including immersion cooling and direct-to-chip cooling technologies.</p><p>Emerging intelligent thermal control systems will also be examined as critical components for maintaining facility efficiency and reliability. These innovations enable data centers to manage the substantial thermal loads created by next-generation chips while reducing energy consumption. The panel will provide attendees with actionable insights into implementing these technologies effectively.</p><p>Altizer will be joined by industry experts including Mohammed Alrob from Microsoft, Ryan Hansen from Schneider, Ryan Murto from Kais-AIR, and Phill Lawson-Shanks from Aligned Data Centers. The session will be moderated by Jim Marsh of Munters. The conference will cover additional topics including innovative power strategies, facility efficiency techniques, and flexible construction approaches for modern data center operations.</p><p>The growing demand for AI infrastructure has created unprecedented challenges for data center cooling systems, making these discussions particularly timely for industry professionals.
