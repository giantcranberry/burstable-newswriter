<p>EMAM has announced the beta release of eMAM version 6.0, featuring a free on-premise AI tool designed to address growing security and cost concerns in media management. The new eMAM Next AI connector leverages open-source large language models to automatically enrich untagged videos with speech-to-text, summarization, and title generation capabilities, eliminating the need for manual tagging while keeping data securely within organizations' local infrastructure.</p><p>According to EMAM President David Miller, the perpetual free license offer for new customers through the end of the year responds to increasing demand for fully on-premise AI solutions. The system operates on affordable HP Z2 workstations, making advanced AI capabilities accessible to organizations without compromising data security or incurring significant hardware costs. This approach allows companies to maintain complete control over their media assets while benefiting from AI-powered automation.</p><p>The new version also introduces a simplified "Client" web interface with WCAG 2.1 A and AA compliance, enabling authorized non-technical users and external stakeholders to access the eMAM media library without requiring additional user licenses. This feature provides organizations with greater flexibility in sharing media with clients and partners while maintaining security protocols and avoiding increased licensing expenses.</p><p>Version 6.0 incorporates numerous workflow improvements and new integrations, including enhanced collaboration with Cutting Room for media creation and sharing, expanded media storage and archive options, and improved tools for incorporating third-party metadata to make media more searchable and usable. The update also offers orchestration options that allow third-party tools to integrate processes between eMAM and other platforms, creating more seamless workflow environments.</p><p>Additional enhancements include editing improvements for raw camera media, expanded options for sharing content on social media and other platforms, and new channel partners to support organizations in local markets worldwide. The platform continues to offer over 100 third-party integrated technology partners, enabling customers to build customized workflows tailored to their specific needs in local, cloud, and hybrid environments.</p><p>The release represents a significant shift in the media asset management landscape, providing organizations with enterprise-grade AI capabilities without the security risks associated with cloud-based solutions or the high costs typically associated with on-premise AI implementations. By offering these features through a free license model, EMAM aims to make advanced media management accessible to a broader range of organizations while addressing critical security concerns in an increasingly regulated digital environment.</p>
