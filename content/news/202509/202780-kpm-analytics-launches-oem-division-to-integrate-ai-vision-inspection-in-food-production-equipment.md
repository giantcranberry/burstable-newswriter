<p>KPM Analytics has announced the formation of a new Original Equipment Manufacturer division focused on integrating advanced vision inspection and foreign material detection technologies directly into food production equipment. This strategic initiative leverages the company's <a href="https://kpmanalytics.com/ai-driven-applications" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">AI-driven applications</a> and decades of expertise to create seamless solutions for equipment manufacturers seeking to enhance their offerings with integrated quality control systems.</p><p>The division will utilize KPM's product brands including EyePro System, Sightline Process Control, and Smart Vision Works, bringing over 50 years of combined expertise in vision inspection technology and 17 years in AI model development specifically tailored for food applications. This move addresses the growing need for comprehensive quality assurance in food processing operations where surface defects, structural irregularities, and foreign material contamination pose significant risks to food safety and brand reputation.</p><p>Andrea Bertuolo, KPM's Managing Director for Vision Inspection Systems, explained that embedding inspection systems directly into OEM equipment enables manufacturers to deliver tools that provide immediate value for food processors. The technology helps identify defects, monitor product uniformity, and ensure compliance with customer specifications while simultaneously reducing waste and minimizing production downtime through early detection of issues.</p><p>KPM's new division is actively pursuing partnerships across multiple food sectors including baking, meat and poultry, confectionery, and root crop industries to integrate high-performance inspection systems into production lines globally. The company has established itself as an industry reference for vision inspection technology due to its extensive experience and longevity in food production applications.</p><p>Brian Mitchell, KPM's Chief Executive Officer, emphasized that as food manufacturers face increasing demands for quality assurance, operational efficiency, and food safety compliance, the OEM division aims to make vision-based inspection technologies more accessible to equipment manufacturers and integrators. The division provides a direct pathway for incorporating KPM's expertise into equipment designs, creating applications that can alert personnel or automatically correct mechanical errors before they escalate into significant production problems.</p><p>The company plans to demonstrate its integrated vision inspection solutions at the International Baking Industry Expo 2025 in Las Vegas, showcasing combinations of vision inspection technology with online near-infrared moisture analyzers for comprehensive quality and food safety control. This approach represents a significant advancement in how food processing equipment manufacturers can address the complex challenges of modern food production while meeting evolving regulatory requirements and consumer expectations for food safety and quality.</p>
