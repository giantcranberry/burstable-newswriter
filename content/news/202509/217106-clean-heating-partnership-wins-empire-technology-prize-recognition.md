<p>The partnership between Ambient Enterprises, Gil-Bar, and Flow Environmental Systems has been named runner-up in the prestigious $10 million Empire Technology Prize, receiving a $100,000 award for their innovative clean heating technology. The prize program, launched by The Clean Fight with support from NYSERDA, Wells Fargo, and RMI, aims to accelerate the development of alternatives to fossil fuel boilers across New York State.</p><p>The consortium was recognized for its high-temperature hot water solution powered by a natural carbon dioxide refrigerant that provides sustainable heating, domestic hot water, and simultaneous heating and cooling capabilities. This versatile technology represents a significant advancement in building decarbonization efforts, particularly important for New York's aggressive climate goals. Governor Kathy Hochul announced the winners, emphasizing the critical role such innovations play in the state's climate strategy.</p><p>The Empire Technology Prize supported seven finalist teams over the past year as they piloted solutions designed to reduce carbon emissions while ensuring scalable, reliable performance for New York's diverse building stock. According to program information available at <a href="https://thecleanfight.com/etp" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">thecleanfight.com/etp</a>, the initiative awarded $4.15 million to support first-of-their-kind demonstration projects across the state, with an additional $4.75 million in milestone funding available.</p><p>A demonstration project of the Ambient-Gil-Bar-Flow solution is scheduled to launch at Union Theological Seminary in Upper Manhattan, marking a crucial step toward proving the scalability and effectiveness of carbon-neutral heating systems in real-world applications. This practical testing phase will provide valuable data on the system's performance and reliability under actual operating conditions.</p><p>Chris Bisaccia, CEO of Ambient Enterprises, stated that the recognition validates the strength of their partnerships and engineering expertise in delivering scalable, real-world solutions. Tony Tanzillo, COO of Ambient, added that the achievement underscores their mission to provide clean, practical HVAC solutions that meet current building owner needs while preparing New York for a carbon-free future. The technology addresses a critical gap in the market for high-temperature heating alternatives that can replace fossil fuel systems without compromising performance.</p><p>The Empire Technology Prize represents a significant investment in building-wide decarbonization, offering property owners new options that are easier to adopt and deploy at scale. Johnson Controls received an honorable mention for its cascaded cycle and mechanical vapor recompression solution, indicating the breadth of innovation occurring in the clean heating sector. These developments come as New York implements its nation-leading climate legislation, which requires substantial reductions in building emissions over the coming decades.</p><p>The recognition of the Ambient-Gil-Bar-Flow partnership signals growing momentum for practical decarbonization technologies that can be implemented across New York's diverse building types. As buildings account for a significant portion of the state's carbon emissions, solutions like this high-temperature hot water system will be essential for meeting climate targets while maintaining reliable heating for residents and businesses throughout the state.</p>
