<p>LaFleur Minerals Inc. has provided a significant update on development activities at its Beacon Gold Mill and Swanson Gold Deposit in Québec's Abitibi Gold Belt. The company is currently completing mill maintenance, planning drilling near the historic Beacon Mine, and preparing logistics to restart production using mineralized material from the Swanson Deposit. An independent evaluation has confirmed restart readiness within a $5 million budget while highlighting that replacement costs would exceed C$71.5 million, underscoring the strategic value of the existing infrastructure.</p><p>The company is finalizing a comprehensive preliminary economic assessment due by October 2025 that will provide detailed analysis of the project's economic viability. At the Swanson Deposit, 24 drill holes totaling 5,283 metres have been completed, with initial assays from six holes returning high-grade, near-surface intercepts. These results include step-out extensions that reinforce the scale, continuity, and open-pit potential of the deposit, suggesting substantial resource expansion opportunities.</p><p>The Swanson Gold Project covers approximately 18,304 hectares and includes several prospects rich in gold and critical metals previously held by Monarch Mining, Abcourt Mines, and Globex Mining. LaFleur has recently consolidated a large land package along a major structural break that hosts the Swanson, Bartec, and Jolin gold deposits along with several other showings. The project's accessibility by road allows direct access to several nearby gold mills, enhancing its development potential and reducing infrastructure costs.</p><p>LaFleur Minerals' fully-permitted and refurbished Beacon Gold Mill is capable of processing over 750 tonnes per day and is being considered for processing mineralized material from Swanson as well as for custom milling operations for other nearby gold projects.

The ability to process material from multiple sources through the existing mill infrastructure provides operational flexibility and potential revenue diversification beyond the company's primary assets.</p>
