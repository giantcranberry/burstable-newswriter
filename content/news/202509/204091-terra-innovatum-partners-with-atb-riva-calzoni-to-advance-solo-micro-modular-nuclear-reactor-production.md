<p>Terra Innovatum Srl has signed a memorandum of understanding with ATB Riva Calzoni, a global supplier and manufacturer of nuclear components, for the preparation, development, and production of Terra Innovatum's SOLO micro-modular nuclear reactor. This partnership establishes a comprehensive multi-phase collaboration for manufacturing the first-of-a-kind SOLO reactor and preparation for serialization and industrialization by 2028.</p><p>Alessandro Petruzzi, CEO of Terra Innovatum, stated that signing this MOU with ATB is a major inflection point as the company moves closer to making the first commercial deployment of the SOLO micro-modular reactor a reality. The shared commitment to quality and innovation will enable the delivery of reliable, affordable clean energy where it's needed most, quickly and at scale.</p><p>Giordano Morichi, Partner, Chief Business Development Officer & Investor Relations, emphasized that this collaboration is a testament to Terra Innovatum's vision and the tangible market momentum behind its advanced nuclear solution. With a leading manufacturing partner in place, already serving several nuclear leaders and colossal industry manufacturers, the path forward is clear, de-risked, and confident in deploying SOLO by the target of 2028.</p><p>Francesco Squaratti, Managing Director of ATB Riva Calzoni, expressed pride in supporting the development and manufacturing of Terra Innovatum's SOLO reactor and partnering on a project that delivers a reliable and safe energy solution. Combining ATB's century-long legacy in complex energy infrastructure with Terra Innovatum's micro-modular technology will help set new benchmarks in safety, performance, and sustainability for the nuclear industry.</p><p>ATB Riva Calzoni brings a heavy international presence with deep operations in Europe and South America and offices across the U.S., Canada, Africa, and Australia, along with a proven track record of supplying leading nuclear and energy companies worldwide. Many major U.S. and European players already rely on Italian manufacturers for critical components, and this partnership strengthens Terra Innovatum's manufacturing capabilities as it advances SOLO toward commercialization.</p><p>The framework for collaboration marks a breakthrough for Terra Innovatum's commercialization journey, unlocking the manufacturing scale and expertise needed to deliver the SOLO micro-modular reactor from concept to commercial reality. The multi-phase collaboration agreement supports SOLO development by advancing component readiness and accelerating production scale-up to deliver a market-ready clean energy solution that positions Terra Innovatum for commercial launch.</p><p>Under the MOU, Terra Innovatum and ATB will work closely to conduct joint feasibility studies and advance component design, safety evaluations, engineering validation, and regulatory and project risk assessments. At commercialization stage, ATB is expected to lead component manufacturing and commissioning of SOLO and support commercial production and manufacturing at scale.</p><p>SOLO will offer a wide range of versatile applications, providing CO2-free, behind-the-meter, and off-grid power solutions for data centers, mini-grids serving remote towns and villages, and large-scale industrial operations in hard-to-abate sectors like cement production, oil and gas, steel manufacturing, and mining. It also has the ability to supply heat for industrial applications and other specialized processes, including water treatment, desalination and co-generation.
