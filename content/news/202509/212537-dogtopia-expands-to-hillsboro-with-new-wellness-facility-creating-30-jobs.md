<p>Dogtopia, the nation's leading dog wellness franchise, is opening a new location in Hillsboro on September 29th at 7478 E. Main St, providing award-winning dog daycare, boarding and spa services to local pet owners. The facility represents a significant addition to the community's pet care options, offering specialized services in a controlled environment designed for canine safety and wellbeing.</p><p>The 6,000-square-foot facility is expected to create 30 jobs with the unique benefit of allowing team members to bring their dogs to work at no cost. Owner Jeremy Shidner, a serial entrepreneur who previously operated fitness centers in Portland, chose Dogtopia for its community-focused approach and alignment with health and wellness values. This marks the first of five planned locations Shidner intends to open in the greater Portland metro area.</p><p>Dogtopia's operational standards set industry benchmarks with strict vaccine and spay/neuter policies, thorough health checks, and playrooms organized by dog size and play style. The facility features compressed rubber flooring to reduce impact on dogs' paws and joints, climate-controlled environments, and professional supervision by trained Canine Coaches. All dogs undergo careful evaluation before entering the social play environment.</p><p>The grand opening weekend beginning September 29th includes special offers, including unlimited weekly daycare at $79 per week for one year. Each enrolled dog receives a free DASH activity monitor during their Meet & Greet and a complimentary full-service bath during the first month of operation. These limited-time offers are available while spots remain in the program.</p><p>Beyond local services, Dogtopia operates the <a href="https://www.dogtopia.com/portland-oregon-hillsboro/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Dogtopia Foundation</a>, a nonprofit that funds programs for service dogs for veterans, therapy dogs for students, and employment initiatives for adults with autism. One hundred percent of funds raised are donated directly to supported organizations, extending the company's impact beyond immediate pet care services. The Hillsboro location will operate from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. Monday through Friday and 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. on weekends, providing consistent care options for working pet owners.</p>
