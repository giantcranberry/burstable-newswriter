<p>Easy Environmental Solutions Inc. has received full payment for its first EasyFEN waste-to-liquid microbial fertilizer unit destined for Kenya, with shipment expected within 90 to 120 days. This milestone marks the company's official launch in Africa and initiates what could become a large-scale initiative addressing food insecurity and soil degradation across the continent.</p><p>The EasyFEN system represents a decentralized, fully automatic "Fertilizer Plant in a Box" that converts local community waste into Terreplenish organic microbial fertilizer. According to company data, each unit can process two tons of biomass per hour, producing up to 2.7 million gallons of Terreplenish annually. This output can treat approximately 1.35 million acres of farmland each year.</p><p>Africa faces severe agricultural challenges, with two-thirds of the continent classified as arid or semi-arid and desertification worsening due to climate change. As of 2023, one in five people in Africa experienced hunger, and projections indicate 582 million people globally will be undernourished by 2030, with over half residing in Africa. Kenya specifically struggles with one-third of its population living below poverty level and 29% of rural children suffering from stunted growth due to famine.</p><p>The company claims Terreplenish, validated by over 100 independent studies and backed by more than a decade of field data, restores soil health, boosts yields, and reduces irrigation needs by up to 20%. Two gallons per acre delivers 45-60 pounds of nitrogen and 15-20 pounds of phosphorus while improving plant growth and reducing chemical dependence.</p><p>At full capacity, a single EasyFEN unit is projected to generate approximately $19 million in recurring annual revenue, creating a scalable, high-margin growth model. Each operational unit can produce enough Terreplenish to support food production for more than five million people annually.</p><p>Beyond Kenya, Easy Environmental Solutions has delivered Terreplenish samples to Congo, Tanzania, and Somalia, with field trials reportedly exceeding expectations. The company aims to deploy units across Africa with the goal of Terreplenish availability in every African country by 2027. This expansion represents not just technological deployment but a shift toward agricultural sovereignty and long-term independence for African nations facing critical food security challenges.</p>
