<p>AFC Planning Group, a Melville-based advisory team managing approximately $110 million in client assets, has transitioned from LPL Financial to join Osaic, Inc., one of the nation's largest wealth management solution providers. The two-person firm, established in 2008 by managing partners Lou Addesso and Frank Fattizzi, will operate under Affiliated Advisors, an Osaic office of supervisory jurisdiction. This strategic move represents a significant shift in the wealth management landscape, particularly for firms prioritizing long-term client relationships over transactional interactions.</p><p>The transition reflects AFC Planning Group's deliberate decision to align with a platform offering stronger tools and support while maintaining their established client-focused approach. Addesso emphasized that their firm's culture is rooted in integrity, responsiveness, and genuine care, stating that their choice to join Affiliated Advisors and the Osaic community was shaped by this relationship-oriented mindset. The firm specializes in serving high-net-worth individuals and small to mid-sized businesses, making platform capabilities crucial for delivering sophisticated service.</p><p>Kristen Kimmell, executive vice president of business development at Osaic, noted that partnering with AFC Planning Group represents a natural fit due to shared client-first values. She indicated that by leveraging Osaic's platform, Addesso and Fattizzi can enhance efficiency and dedicate more time to client service. Osaic's model emphasizes empowering advisor independence while providing resources to support business growth and operational effectiveness, a combination increasingly sought by established advisory teams.</p><p>The move is part of a broader pattern of advisory firms transitioning from LPL Financial to Osaic, with other recent examples including Simplified Wealth Management and Strategic Financial Management. This trend suggests a market shift toward platforms that balance technological sophistication with personalized support. Osaic supports approximately 11,000 financial professionals nationwide and continues to attract firms seeking a people-first experience aligned with their consultative approach. Additional information about Osaic's services and platform is available at <a href="https://Osaic.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://Osaic.com</a>.</p><p>For business leaders and technology observers, this transition highlights several important industry implications. The movement of established firms like AFC Planning Group signals that wealth management platforms must increasingly demonstrate their ability to support sophisticated client service models while maintaining advisor autonomy. As advisory teams manage more complex client needs, particularly in the high-net-worth and business segments, platform selection becomes increasingly strategic. The emphasis on operational efficiency suggests that technology integration and workflow optimization are becoming critical differentiators in the competitive wealth management landscape.</p><p>The broader pattern of transitions to Osaic indicates a market response to specific platform capabilities that align with evolving advisor needs. For industry observers, this movement provides insight into how established advisory firms are navigating the balance between technological capability and personalized service delivery. As the wealth management industry continues to consolidate and evolve, such transitions will likely influence how platforms position themselves and how advisors evaluate their partnership options.</p>
