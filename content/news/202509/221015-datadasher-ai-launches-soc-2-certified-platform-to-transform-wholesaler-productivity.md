<p>DataDasher AI has launched an SOC 2-certified artificial intelligence platform specifically engineered for investment sponsors and their wholesaling teams. The platform leverages proprietary Brain Language AI technology to address the unique productivity challenges faced by wholesalers who frequently travel and manage multiple client relationships simultaneously.</p><p>According to Alexander Kearns, CEO of DataDasher, the platform was developed to overcome the connectivity hurdles that wholesalers encounter while ensuring compliance with industry standards. The technology provides a comprehensive suite of tools including real-time data queries, automated email drafting, meeting transcription, note-taking, task detection, and team collaboration capabilities. This integrated approach helps wholesalers save between 10 to 15 hours each week by streamlining meeting preparation, client interactions, and follow-up processes.</p><p>The platform's unified client context feature captures and organizes every professional touchpoint, making them actionable for wholesaling teams. This system integrates seamlessly with widely used CRM and meeting platforms including Salesforce, Redtail, Wealthbox, XLR8, Google, Zoom, and Microsoft, creating a connected experience across various settings including in-person meetings, phone calls, and web conferences.</p><p>Security and data protection form the foundation of the platform's design, featuring strong encryption, secure cloud infrastructure, and multi-factor authentication. As an SOC 2-certified system, DataDasher operates in private silos for each investment sponsor firm and does not use customer data to train external AI models. The platform also enables customizable data retention policies and gives users control over which meetings are transcribed, addressing critical privacy concerns in financial services.</p><p>Financial professionals can experience the platform's capabilities through a tailored demo or sandbox trial environment available at <a href="https://www.datadasher.ai/demo" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.datadasher.ai/demo</a>. The SOC 2 certification provides assurance that DataDasher meets rigorous standards for security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, and privacy in financial services operations, positioning it as a trusted solution for investment firms seeking to enhance team productivity while maintaining regulatory compliance.</p>
