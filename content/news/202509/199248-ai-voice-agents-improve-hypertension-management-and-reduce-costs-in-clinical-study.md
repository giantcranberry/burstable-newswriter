<p>Artificial intelligence voice agents significantly improved blood pressure monitoring accuracy and patient outcomes for older adults with hypertension, according to preliminary research presented at the American Heart Association's Hypertension Scientific Sessions 2025. The study involving 2,000 predominantly older adults demonstrated how integrating AI into clinical workflows can enhance home blood pressure monitoring completion rates, leading to better quality outcomes for patients.</p><p>The research evaluated the effectiveness of voice-enabled AI agents in engaging patients to self-report accurate blood pressure readings instead of traditional phone calls with healthcare professionals. The AI system, using commercially available technology in multiple languages including English and Spanish, also identified patients requiring follow-up medical care based on their readings. This aligns with the American Heart Association's Target:BP initiative at https://targetbp.org, which helps healthcare organizations improve blood pressure control rates through evidence-based programs.</p><p>When blood pressure readings fell outside threshold ranges or patients reported symptoms such as dizziness, blurred vision, or chest pain, calls were immediately escalated to licensed nurses or medical assistants. This process reduced manual workload for clinicians and resulted in an 88.7% lower cost-per-reading compared to human nurses performing similar tasks, representing significant operational efficiency gains for healthcare organizations.</p><p>During the 10-week study period conducted at Emory Healthcare in Atlanta, 85% of patients were successfully reached by the AI voice agent, with 67% completing calls and 60% taking compliant blood pressure readings during the interaction. Among these patients, 68% met controlling blood pressure Stars compliance thresholds. The initiative closed 1,939 CBP gaps, elevating performance from 1-Star to 4-Star ratingâ€”a 17% improvement in the Medicare Advantage and Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set measure.</p><p>Patient satisfaction exceeded expectations, with average ratings above 9 out of 10 on post-call surveys. The study supports recommendations in the Association's new 2025 guideline on high blood pressure available at https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/high-blood-pressure, advocating home monitoring for all adults with hypertension. While the findings show promise for transforming blood pressure management, the study has limitations as an observational, retrospective analysis without a control group, and full implications will become clearer once peer-reviewed publication occurs.</p>
