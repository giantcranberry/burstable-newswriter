<p>BluSky AI Inc. has executed a non-binding Letter of Intent to lease approximately 16,000 square feet in Nephi, Utah, for its next SkyMod deployment. The planned 0.375-acre site will support up to 4 MW of scalable capacity with a 10-year lease term that includes optional extensions. This expansion represents BluSky AI's continued focus on building rapidly deployable data center solutions specifically engineered for artificial intelligence applications.</p><p>CEO Trent D'Ambrosio described the Nephi site as a strategic milestone in the company's multi-state infrastructure roadmap. He cited Nephi's scalable power infrastructure and geographic resilience as key advantages supporting BluSky AI's mission to democratize access to high-performance computing resources. The company's SkyMod data centers are designed as next-generation, scalable AI factories that provide speed-to-market deployment and energy optimization for organizations requiring high-performance infrastructure to support machine learning workloads.</p><p>The base rent structure begins at $4,000 per month and escalates to $28,000 per month upon full activation of the facility. This expansion comes as demand for specialized AI computing infrastructure continues to grow across multiple sectors, with companies seeking more flexible and scalable solutions than traditional data centers can provide. The Nephi location's characteristics align with the increasing industry focus on geographic diversity and resilience in computing infrastructure planning.</p><p>BluSky AI's modular approach aims to serve small to mid-sized businesses, enterprise clients, and academic institutions seeking to drive innovation without the traditional infrastructure constraints. Additional information about the company's developments is available in its newsroom at <a href="http://ibn.fm/BSAI" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://ibn.fm/BSAI</a>. The full details of the announcement can be viewed in the complete press release available at <a href="https://ibn.fm/KdLWw" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://ibn.fm/KdLWw</a>.</p><p>The Utah expansion represents a significant development in the AI infrastructure landscape, particularly for organizations that require specialized computing resources but lack the capital for traditional data center investments. This model addresses the growing need for distributed AI computing capacity that can scale with demand while maintaining energy efficiency. The timing coincides with increased industry recognition that AI infrastructure requires specialized design considerations beyond conventional data center capabilities.</p><p>For business leaders and technology executives, BluSky AI's approach offers potential solutions to the ongoing challenges of AI infrastructure accessibility and scalability. The modular design philosophy enables faster deployment times and more flexible capacity planning compared to traditional data center models. This could significantly impact how organizations approach their AI strategy, particularly those in regions underserved by existing cloud infrastructure providers.</p>
