<p>As organizations accelerate artificial intelligence adoption, Hupside co-founder Jonathan Aberman cautions that focusing exclusively on technological efficiency while neglecting human originality could trigger widespread homogenization of ideas and business strategies. The entrepreneur and innovation strategist emphasizes that while AI delivers clear efficiency gains comparable to past technological transformations, it differs fundamentally in its inability to generate genuinely novel insights.</p><p>Aberman identifies what he considers a critical gap in current AI implementation approaches: the people who work effectively with AI systems. Recent research indicates that 95% of companies have failed to achieve return on investment from AI adoption, suggesting that technology implementation alone proves insufficient for meaningful transformation. Hupside addresses this challenge through its <a href="https://hupside.com/hupchecker" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Hupchecker platform</a>, which quantifies originality using a new metric called the Original Intelligence Quotient (OIQ).</p><p>The stakes for successful AI transformation exceed those of previous technological shifts because AI alters the fundamental nature of human contribution, Aberman contends. Organizations concentrating solely on efficiency risk entering a competitive race to the bottom where identical tools produce similar ideas at comparable speeds. This dynamic erodes differentiation and long-term profitability, while companies intentionally combining AI with human originality will build sustainable competitive advantages.</p><p>Hupside's methodology diverges from traditional assessments focused on personality traits or fixed rubrics. Instead of measuring inherent characteristics, the platform evaluates outcomes by comparing individual ideas against both human responses and AI baselines, mapping them into what Aberman describes as an idea space. This approach provides organizations with objective measurements of originality in practice rather than subjective judgments about creativity or productivity.</p><p>The platform's applications span multiple sectors, including government and public initiatives where AI adoption risks are particularly significant without proper human oversight. For transformation consultants, OIQ data serves as a benchmark for progress management and change guidance. Private sector organizations utilize the technology to identify value creators across functions from product development to investment evaluation.</p><p>Educational institutions represent another critical application area as students growing up with constant AI presence must learn to think beyond algorithmic outputs. Aberman believes Original Intelligence should become standard curriculum content because the future belongs to those who can leverage AI while maintaining independent thought. As AI assumes routine tasks, human originality becomes the defining measure of human value and what Aberman characterizes as a survival skill for businesses, governments, and individuals.</p><p>Hupside's role in this evolving landscape involves making originality visible, measurable, and scalable through tools ensuring humans remain at innovation's forefront. The company's approach provides organizations with what Aberman calls a heatmap showing where originality exists within their workforce, serving as a roadmap for building teams that don't merely adapt to technological change but actively shape future developments.</p>
