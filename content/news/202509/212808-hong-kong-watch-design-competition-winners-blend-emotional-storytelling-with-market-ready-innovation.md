<p>The 42nd Hong Kong Watch and Clock Design Competition concluded with winning entries that break from conventional watch design while demonstrating significant market potential for Hong Kong's watch industry. The competition, held during the 44th HKTDC Hong Kong Watch & Clock Fair and the 13th Salon de TIME, attracted 116 entries across Open and Student categories, with designs that blend emotional storytelling with innovative mechanical elements.</p><p>Open Group winner Tam Kwok Tung's "FREEZE" design drew inspiration from childhood memories of his father taking photographs, featuring a camera lens as the central dial element. The unconventional layout includes a right window displaying the watch's movement and a left window with gears driving the hands. Sponsored by <a href="https://www.wincyhorological.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Wincy Horological Ltd</a>, this design represents the competition's emphasis on personal narrative through horological innovation.</p><p>Student Group winner Chan Tsz Ying from Hong Kong Design Institute received dual recognition for "Aspire," which won both the Student category and the Made-to-Sell Award. The watch features moving beads symbolizing goal-chasing and stationary beads representing reflection moments. Industry veterans and former HKTDC Assistant Executive Director Stephen Liang selected this design for its strong market potential, with plans for commercial production and sale through the <a href="https://www.hktdc.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">HKTDC Design Gallery</a>.</p><p>The competition's thematic approach—"Memorable" for Open Group and "Believe in Yourself" for Student Group—resulted in designs that translate emotional concepts into functional timepieces. First runner-up Wong Ting Bong's "RB_ROBO" drew inspiration from toy robots to convey that "adults can still preserve their childlike innocence," while second runner-up Oro Time Limited's "Backtrack" incorporated nostalgic elements like game consoles and vinyl records, allowing users to swap different "game cartridges" for customizable fashion statements.</p><p>Student designs emphasized philosophical messages alongside technical execution. Lee Yuet Tung Eudora from Good Hope School placed first runner-up with "Believe in Yourself," featuring the words "Love," "Hope," and "Faith" printed on the outer ring to highlight essential guides for overcoming challenges. Second runner-up Yip Yuen Sze Christine from Hong Kong Design Institute created "Broken Stars in the Ripples" with surface ripple patterns and a star hour hand, conveying that "even if life has ups and downs, it is still full of hope."</p><p>The competition's integration with major trade events like the Hong Kong Watch & Clock Fair and Salon de TIME provided immediate exposure to international buyers, with the fairs attracting approximately 16,000 trade buyers from 95 countries. This global platform enhances the commercial viability of winning designs while reinforcing Hong Kong's position as an innovation hub in watch manufacturing. The continued success of the competition demonstrates how emotional storytelling and technical innovation can create market-ready products that resonate with both trade buyers and end consumers.</p>
