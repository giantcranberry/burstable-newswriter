<p>LabConnect, a global central laboratory services provider, has announced a strategic collaboration with artificial intelligence company OmniScience to deliver the industry's first AI-driven solution for real-time clinical trial lab data analysis. The partnership combines LabConnect's expertise in laboratory testing and data management with OmniScience's Vivo platform, an AI-native clinical trial intelligence system designed specifically for laboratory data.</p><p>The collaboration addresses significant challenges in clinical research where laboratory data often remains siloed, complex, and delayed, leading to slow decision-making and increased trial risks. The integrated solution enables trial sponsors to unify fragmented lab datasets, automate oversight processes, and identify risk signals that can accelerate trial timelines and improve overall outcomes.</p><p>Vivo-Lab, the specialized implementation of OmniScience's platform, streamlines laboratory workflows by detecting critical trends, anomalies, and site-level discrepancies as they occur, shifting teams from reactive to proactive oversight. This represents the first agentic AI solution specifically designed for live clinical laboratory data, potentially revolutionizing how pharmaceutical companies and research organizations manage and utilize laboratory information throughout the clinical development lifecycle.</p><p>Angela Holmes, CEO and Co-Founder of OmniScience, emphasized the partnership's significance, stating that it extends their mission to help trial teams see and act faster by transforming lab data into actionable intelligence that sponsors can trust. Wes Wheeler, CEO of LabConnect, added that the integration of transformative AI technology converts laboratory results from static reports into dynamic, actionable intelligence, providing clinical operations teams with the speed, agility, and precision needed for smarter decision-making.</p><p>The partnership represents a significant advancement in clinical development innovation, merging LabConnect's technology-driven laboratory operations with OmniScience's AI-native approach to trial intelligence.
