<p>SEGG Media Corporation has signed a Letter of Intent to acquire all assets of Racing Women Limited through its subsidiary Sports.com Media Group Ltd. The agreement provides Sports.com Media with a 51% controlling stake in a new entity holding Racing Women's assets at a $1 million valuation, with options to expand to full ownership. This acquisition includes Racing Women's intellectual property and global rights, positioning the initiative as a core component of SEGG Media's motorsport expansion strategy.</p><p>The timing of this acquisition follows the successful inaugural Sports.com Nations Trophy at Donington Park, where eight Racing Women competitors represented seven nations. Austrian driver Jorden Dolischka claimed the championship title, earning a funded drive at the Radical Gulf Cup in Abu Dhabi this November. This event demonstrated the competitive potential and international appeal of women's motorsport, validating SEGG Media's strategic investment in the platform.</p><p>SEGG Media Corporation, trading on NASDAQ under tickers SEGG and LTRYW, operates as a global sports, entertainment and gaming group with a portfolio of digital assets. The company focuses on immersive fan engagement, ethical gaming and AI-driven live experiences, aiming to redefine how global audiences interact with content. This acquisition aligns with the company's broader strategy to expand its presence in specialized sports markets while promoting diversity and inclusion. Additional company information is available through their newsroom at <a href="http://ibn.fm/SEGG" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://ibn.fm/SEGG</a>.</p><p>The implications of this acquisition extend beyond corporate expansion into addressing gender representation in motorsport. By acquiring Racing Women's assets, SEGG Media gains control over a pioneering initiative that supports female drivers in a traditionally male-dominated industry. The move could potentially increase commercial opportunities for women in racing while creating new content and engagement opportunities for SEGG Media's digital platforms.</p><p>This strategic acquisition represents a significant step in professionalizing women's motorsport while creating synergies with SEGG Media's existing digital assets. The integration of Racing Women's platform with SEGG Media's technology and distribution capabilities could accelerate the growth of women's racing globally, potentially creating new revenue streams and audience engagement opportunities in an underserved market segment. For business and technology leaders, this move demonstrates how strategic acquisitions can simultaneously drive corporate growth while advancing social objectives in specialized markets.</p>
