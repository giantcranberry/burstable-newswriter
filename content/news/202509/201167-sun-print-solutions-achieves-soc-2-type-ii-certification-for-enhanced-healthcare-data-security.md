<p>Sun Print Solutions has achieved SOC 2 Type II certification, marking a significant advancement in data security and compliance for healthcare communications. This certification validates the company's ability to manage and protect sensitive information, particularly protected health information (PHI), which is crucial for clients in the healthcare sector where data security is both a priority and a legal requirement.</p><p>RJ Deneau, Business Development Manager at Sun Print Solutions, stated that achieving SOC 2 Type II certification reinforces the company's commitment to secure, compliant, and high-quality print solutions, especially for clients in sensitive, highly regulated industries like healthcare. The SOC 2 framework, developed by the <a href="https://www.aicpa.org" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA)</a>, evaluates how well a company safeguards customer data, with Type II certification involving a thorough audit of systems, procedures, and performance over time to verify effective controls.</p><p>The certification process required months of preparation, implementation, and independent auditing by a third-party assessor. Sun Print Solutions' policies, procedures, infrastructure, and operational practices were evaluated against strict criteria across five trust principles: security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, and privacy. This assessment not only tested existing safeguards but also led to refinements that further strengthened the company's data protection posture.</p><p>Healthcare organizations rely on Sun Print Solutions for services such as personalized appointment reminders and data-rich wellness campaigns, which require fully in-house print and mail operations that meet rigorous privacy and compliance standards. The SOC 2 Type II certification ensures that clients can trust both the output and the process, providing confidence in the handling of sensitive data.</p><p>As organizations scale personalization efforts using variable data printing, the risk exposure grows, making certifications like SOC 2 Type II essential for meeting current privacy standards and future challenges. Sun Print Solutions also maintains its union certification and other industry-recognized compliance benchmarks, reinforcing its role as a reliable and secure partner across highly regulated sectors.</p><p>This achievement is part of Sun Print Solutions' ongoing investment in data security and operational excellence, ensuring that the company remains proactive in strengthening infrastructure, refining internal controls, and leading with transparency as data regulations evolve and client expectations increase.</p>
