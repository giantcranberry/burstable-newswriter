<p>Internationally recognized brand strategist Ulli Appelbaum has released what is being hailed as a modern marketing classic with his new book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Science-Brand-Associations-Minds-Markets/dp/1234567890" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">The Science of Brand Associations: Win Minds, Win Markets</a>. The publication represents the first comprehensive, evidence-based guide focused on how truly successful brands are built through the systematic development of brand associations.</p><p>Appelbaum draws on cutting-edge neuroscience, cognitive psychology, and decades of marketing research to reveal what he describes as the hidden operating system that drives brand growth. Unlike most branding advice that remains opinion-based or driven by fads, Appelbaum's approach is rigorously practical, distilling research into a hands-on playbook for marketers, brand strategists, and agency leaders. While researching this book, I deliberately avoided opinion-based frameworks or philosophies in favor of those supported by rigorous data and research, Appelbaum explained.</p><p>The core premise of the book challenges conventional marketing wisdom by positioning brand associations not as one component of branding, but as the fundamental concept that silently drives every successful brand. Cognitive psychology and neuroscience research demonstrates that brands function as mental networks of meanings, feelings, and experiences stored in consumers' minds and memories. These networks shape perception, trigger recall, drive preference, and ultimately determine purchase decisions.</p><p>The book outlines ten data-backed reasons why brand associations drive business results, along with nine proven strategies and fourteen evidence-based principles for building stronger brand association networks. It includes diagnostic scorecards and practical frameworks to assess and strengthen brand health, incorporating insights from respected thought leaders including Mark Ritson, Byron Sharp, Jenni Romaniuk, and Kevin Lane Keller, as well as global research firms such as Ipsos and Kantar.</p><p>Industry leaders have praised the book's practical approach. Ulli connects the dots between marketing science and real-world branding like no one else. This is the OS behind how brands actually grow, said Jacob Cass, Co-host of the JUST Branding Podcast. Paul Chibe, CEO of Pabst Brewing Company, noted that Too often today, marketers operate without direction or focus, wasting precious investment. This book delivers the frameworks needed to build powerful, winning brands.</p><p>Appelbaum brings more than 25 years of global brand strategy experience to the work, having consulted with blue-chip clients across four continents including Unilever, Procter & Gamble, Nestlé, General Mills, and Harley-Davidson. Prior to founding his boutique strategy consultancy First The Trousers Then The Shoes Inc. in 2014, he held senior strategy roles at top global agencies such as BBDO Germany, Leo Burnett Chicago, Fallon Worldwide, and SapientNitro.</p><p>The book's significance lies in its timing, arriving when marketers face increasing pressure to demonstrate return on investment while navigating crowded marketplaces. Jami Guthrie, VP of Strategy, Insights & Prioritization at McDonald's, emphasized that Understanding how brand associations are formed and retrieved doesn't just lead to smarter marketing—it leads to better strategies, better stories, and better results. Appelbaum concludes that brands consistently applying these evidence-based principles grow faster, build stronger preference, and outperform competitors, challenging marketing leaders to demonstrate the discipline required for consistent execution.</p>
