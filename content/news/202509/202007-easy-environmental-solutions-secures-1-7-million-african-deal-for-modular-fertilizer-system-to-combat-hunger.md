<p>Easy Environmental Solutions Inc. has received a deposit from an African client for its EasyFEN Modular Microbe Fertilizer System, marking a significant step in addressing hunger across the continent. The $1.7 million system represents the first of two ordered units that will generate approximately $19 million in annual recurring revenue when operating at full capacity.</p><p>The EasyFEN system functions as a decentralized, fully automatic fertilizer plant that converts local community waste into Terreplenish organic microbial fertilizer. According to company reports, each unit can process two tons of biomass per hour, producing up to 2.7 million gallons of fertilizer annually from recycled food and crop waste. This approach targets unproductive soil while eliminating greenhouse gas emissions associated with traditional fertilizer production.</p><p>CEO Mark Gaalswyk emphasized the system's potential impact, stating that the down payment represents a significant first step in eliminating starvation for all of Africa. The technology replaces expensive chemical imports and rebuilds soil through a scalable model for self-sufficiency that the company plans to replicate across multiple African countries.</p><p>Each EasyFEN unit can produce enough organic fertilizer to treat over 1 million acres of farmland, potentially feeding more than 16 million people. The system utilizes locally derived green biomass mixed with proprietary microbial inoculant to grow fertilizer directly in remote villages, reducing costs by two-thirds compared to chemical alternatives and requiring 20% less rainfall or irrigationâ€”critical advantages for Africa's arid regions.</p><p>With two-thirds of the continent classified as arid or semi-arid and desertification worsening due to climate change, the timing of this technology is particularly significant. As of 2023, one in five Africans faced hunger, and projections indicate 582 million people could be undernourished by 2030, with over half residing in Africa.</p><p>Terreplenish works by introducing beneficial microbes that break down organic matter, release essential nutrients, and improve soil structure and water retention. The company reports that just two gallons naturally delivers 45-60 pounds of nitrogen and 15-20 pounds of phosphorus per acre while functioning as a natural bio-fungicide.</p><p>The first unit is expected to ship to Northern Africa within 90 days, with initial trials in Congo and Somalia already showing results that exceeded expectations. The company has engaged with African agricultural officials, including meetings with Kenya's Cabinet Secretary for Agriculture, to discuss expansion opportunities.</p><p>Nate Carpenter, President of Feed the Famished subsidiary, described the units as strategic weapons in the fight against hunger that restore dignity and fuel self-reliance through a scalable, long-term solution designed to disrupt current food insecurity challenges.</p>
