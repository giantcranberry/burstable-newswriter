<p>Vision Marine Technologies Inc. has formed a strategic partnership with Hydrofin, a U.S. company specializing in patented hydrofoil systems for pontoons. Through its Nautical Ventures dealership network, Vision Marine will integrate Hydrofin's technology, which lifts pontoons partially out of the water to reduce drag, improve efficiency, and enhance ride comfort.</p><p>The integration complements Vision Marine's E-Motionâ„¢ 180E electric propulsion system by extending range and performance, while also improving fuel economy and comfort for internal combustion engine pontoons. The partnership will be supported by joint marketing, training, and service initiatives across Nautical Ventures' Florida retail locations.</p><p>This collaboration represents a significant advancement in marine technology, addressing key challenges in both electric and traditional boating. For electric pontoons, the hydrofoil system's drag reduction directly translates to extended battery range, a critical factor in the adoption of electric marine propulsion. For combustion engine models, the technology offers improved fuel efficiency and a smoother riding experience.</p><p>The partnership leverages Vision Marine's existing retail infrastructure through its Nautical Ventures network, which operates nine locations throughout Florida. This established dealership presence provides immediate market access and service support for the integrated hydrofoil systems. The joint training initiatives ensure that technical staff across all locations will be equipped to install, maintain, and service the new hydrofoil technology.</p><p>Vision Marine Technologies continues to position itself as a disruptive force in the marine industry, combining proprietary engineering with direct-to-consumer sales and after-sales support. The company maintains its newsroom at <a href="https://ibn.fm/VMAR" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://ibn.fm/VMAR</a> where investors can access the latest updates and developments. This partnership with Hydrofin represents another step in Vision Marine's strategy to offer premium boating experiences across both electric and internal combustion segments while advancing marine efficiency and sustainability.</p>
