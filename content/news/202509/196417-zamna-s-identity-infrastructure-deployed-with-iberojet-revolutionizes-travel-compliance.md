<p>Zamna has launched its patented identity infrastructure with Spanish and Portuguese airline Iberojet, addressing growing regulatory challenges in international air travel through automated document validation. The deployment forms a central part of Iberojet's broader digital transformation strategy aimed at cutting queues, reducing manual checks, and ensuring compliance at scale as international travel rules continue to tighten.</p><p>Operating seamlessly in real-time, Zamna's unique technology pre-validates passports, boarding passes, and travel documents days or even weeks before travelers arrive at the airport. The system ensures compliance with each destination's specific entry requirements and provides passengers with early visibility if anything needs correcting, fundamentally changing how airlines manage documentation verification.</p><p>Within the first month of operation, more than 60% of passengers who checked in online entered the Zamna flow, with nearly 70% of them fully verified to fly in advance. Of the few passengers (5%) who were not verified, nearly 70% failed the check due to simple discrepancies in identification. This provides Iberojet with advance visibility into the reasons why identity checks fail, even before passengers arrive at the airport, enabling proactive action and reducing last-minute manual interventions.</p><p>The technology removes 100% of fines from invalid visas, mismatched IDs, or missed electronic travel authorizations, addressing a critical pain point for carriers facing increasingly strict and fast-changing entry requirements across global destinations. The deployment was designed to align with Iberojet's existing tech stack and operational processes, featuring a custom-branded WebView embedded directly within the airline's relaunched online check-in experience at https://www.iberojet.com.</p><p>The system is currently live on Iberojet's long-haul routes from the Iberian Peninsula to Latin America and the Caribbean, including Mexico, Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, and Honduras, with expansion planned for return journeys into Europe and additional routes. Toni Pou Mir, BT & IT Director at Iberojet, reported significant operational improvements, noting that the technology has reduced the check-in process from over an hour to under thirty minutes.</p><p>The partnership has eased pressure on frontline teams, reduced queues, and made the process more intuitive for passengers while managing compliance seamlessly in the background, even in complex cases. As international travel regulations continue to evolve and tighten, Zamna's technology represents a critical infrastructure solution for airlines seeking to guarantee compliance at scale while improving passenger experience and reducing operational costs.</p>
