<p>In merger and acquisition transactions, proper immigration analysis is essential for maintaining workforce stability as U.S. work visas remain employer-, job-, and location-specific. The distinction between stock deals and asset deals proves particularly critical for immigration compliance.</p><p>Stock transactions involving the same legal entity typically allow continuity of immigration sponsorship under the successor-in-interest doctrine, meaning no amended immigration filings are generally required for H-1B, E-3, TN, or L-1 visas provided job duties, location, hours, and wages remain materially unchanged. Asset deals, however, demand careful assessment of whether the buyer qualifies as a successor-in-interest, especially for pending or approved immigration petitions like I-140s for green cards.</p><p>If the buyer fails to assume substantially all assets and liabilities or if business operations change significantly, the new entity may not receive recognition as a successor, necessitating new filings that could jeopardize work authorization. Any transaction altering worksites or job duties triggers compliance actions, with employee relocations requiring new Labor Condition Application filings and worksite postings.</p><p>Remote and hybrid work arrangements still count toward compliance requirements, and the actual employee work location drives regulatory obligations. H-1B and E-3 visa holders commonly require new LCAs and petition amendments when primary worksites change to new areas of intended employment, while L-1 amendments become necessary when duties or levels shift meaningfully.</p><p>I-9 and E-Verify compliance also diverges based on deal structure. Stock deals don't require new I-9 forms solely due to the transaction, with only expiring work authorization needing reverification. Asset deals force buyers to either obtain and maintain the seller's I-9 forms or complete new I-9s within three business days of each employee's start date.</p><p>A practical compliance checklist includes confirming deal structure, building comprehensive foreign national employee rosters during due diligence, deciding I-9 strategy, and mapping Labor Condition Applications to actual worksites. This systematic approach helps identify compliance gaps, prevents status interruption risks, and facilitates smooth post-transaction integration while ensuring adherence to anti-discrimination laws.</p>
