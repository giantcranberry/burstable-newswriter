<p>The Baltimore region has activated a new 2.9-megawatt direct current solar farm in Clarksville, Maryland, marking the first operational facility in a six-project portfolio developed by TurningPoint Energy and owned by Pivot Energy. The project, which celebrated its completion with a September 25 ribbon-cutting ceremony, represents a significant step toward Maryland's goal of achieving 50% renewable electricity by 2030.</p><p>Developed by TurningPoint Energy, a leading greenfield developer in Maryland, and owned and operated by Pivot Energy, a national renewable energy provider, the solar farm will generate approximately 4.25 million kilowatt hours of affordable renewable energy annually. This output is sufficient to power the equivalent of up to 370 Maryland homes using nearly 5,500 solar modules covering an area comparable to 10 football fields. More information about the development company's approach is available at <a href="https://www.turningpointenergy.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">TurningPoint Energy's website</a>.</p><p>The project operates under Maryland's Community Solar Energy Generating System Pilot Program, which enables Baltimore Gas & Electric customers to access lower-cost renewable energy generated locally. Subscribers to this community solar farm will save an average of 10% off their electricity bills annually, with the project already fully subscribed by 11 participants including a local church. This model demonstrates how distributed energy resources can provide immediate financial benefits to consumers while supporting grid reliability.</p><p>Beyond energy generation, the solar farm incorporates dual-use practices including sheep grazing and native pollinator planting to maintain land productivity. Howard County Councilmember Deb Jung noted that the county's solar-friendly zoning regulations have positioned it as a leader in climate-forward solutions despite its relatively small size. These agricultural integrations represent an emerging trend in renewable energy development that maximizes land use efficiency while supporting local ecosystems.</p><p>The project partners have committed to meaningful community investments, with TurningPoint Energy and Pivot Energy jointly contributing $120,000 in donations to local organizations. Recipients include the Autism Society of Maryland, Bryant Woods Elementary School PTA, Community Action Council of Howard County, and several other educational and social service organizations. The Fuel Fund of Maryland will receive $18,000 from Pivot Energy, sufficient to assist 72 Maryland households with energy costs according to Executive Director Debbie Brown. Additional program details can be found at <a href="https://www.pivotenergy.net" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Pivot Energy's website</a>.</p><p>This Clarksville facility serves as the inaugural project in a broader 16.6 MWdc portfolio that will further expand Maryland's renewable energy capacity while continuing the partnership's commitment to community stewardship and local economic benefits. The successful implementation of this community solar model provides a replicable framework for other states seeking to accelerate their renewable energy transitions while ensuring equitable access and local economic participation.</p>
