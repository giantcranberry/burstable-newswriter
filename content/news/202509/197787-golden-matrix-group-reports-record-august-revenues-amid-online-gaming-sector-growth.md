<p>Golden Matrix Group Inc. (NASDAQ: GMGI) reported record revenues of $17.8 million for August 2025, representing an 18% increase compared to $15.1 million in August 2024. The company also recorded strong July performance with $15.7 million in revenues, up 24% from $12.7 million in the same month last year.</p><p>CEO Brian Goodman attributed the exceptional performance to strength across all operating divisions, particularly Meridianbet's sports betting operations and RKings' tournament competitions. Goodman stated that the company is well ahead of its plan and on track to finish the third quarter with record results. He noted that the second quarter had been adversely impacted by an unusual customer-friendly sports outcome, but the third quarter has shown dramatically improved financial performance and strategic strength across both B2B and B2C operations.</p><p>The company expects this positive trend to continue through the rest of 2025 and beyond, reflecting the growing strength of the online gaming sector and Golden Matrix's strategic positioning following its 2024 acquisition of Meridianbet Group, which operates in 15 jurisdictions across Europe, Africa and South America. The record revenues demonstrate the company's ability to capitalize on market opportunities and maintain momentum despite previous quarter challenges.</p><p>Golden Matrix operates across multiple international markets, developing and licensing proprietary gaming platforms through its B2B division while its B2C division, RKings, operates a high-volume eCommerce site for paid competitions. The company also owns and operates MEXPLAY, a regulated online casino in Mexico.
