<p>G Mining Ventures Corp. has reported substantial exploration results from its Oko West Gold Project in Guyana and Gurupi Project in Brazil, revealing high-grade gold discoveries that could significantly impact the company's mining operations. At Oko West, drilling guided by a newly developed Splay Model confirmed a second high-grade plunge of mineralization beyond current pit limits, with intercepts including 2.9 meters at 37.85 g/t gold and 21 meters at 3.80 g/t gold.</p><p>The Splay Model has outlined additional mineralization that could enhance pit economics at Oko West, potentially extending the mine life and improving overall project viability. These results demonstrate the continued potential for resource expansion at the Guyana-based project, which serves as one of the company's anchor assets alongside the TZ Gold Mine in Brazil. The full press release detailing these exploration results is available at <a href="https://ibn.fm/yKLqf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://ibn.fm/yKLqf</a> for comprehensive technical details.</p><p>At the Gurupi Project in Brazil, trenching operations have extended known mineralization 2 kilometers north of the Chega Tudo deposit, with results showing up to 9 meters at 3.52 g/t gold. These findings support the company's plans to launch a drilling program in the fourth quarter of 2025, further validating the prospectivity of this Brazilian asset. Additional information about the company's developments can be found in their newsroom at <a href="https://ibn.fm/GMINF" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://ibn.fm/GMINF</a>.</p><p>Vice President of Geology & Resources Julie-Ana√Øs Debreil stated that the results reinforce Oko West's potential to extend mine life and validate Gurupi's prospectivity as part of a pipeline positioning GMIN to become the next intermediate gold producer. The company's exploration success in both mining-friendly jurisdictions of Guyana and Brazil demonstrates its strategic focus on precious metal project development.</p><p>These discoveries come at a time when the gold mining industry is seeking new high-grade deposits to replace depleting resources, making G Mining Ventures' findings particularly significant for the company's growth trajectory and the broader mining sector. The combination of established operations at TZ Gold Mine and promising exploration results at both Oko West and Gurupi positions the company strategically within the intermediate gold producer landscape, potentially offering investors exposure to growing gold resources in stable mining jurisdictions.</p>
