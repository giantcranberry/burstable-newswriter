<p>Augment Me has launched WotNow?!, a mobile AI agent designed to help students and professionals maintain focus, structure their days around peak energy periods, and support mental wellness. The application is available on both iPhone and Android platforms, with the company also offering an enterprise API for organizational integration.</p><p>WotNow?! utilizes privacy-first remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) technology to assess user engagement and concentration by reading subtle biometric signals through a smartphone's camera. When the system detects a decline in attention, it delivers simple, actionable prompts aimed at restoring focus and facilitating flow states. Over time, the AI agent maps individual Peak Performance Times, enabling users to schedule demanding tasks in alignment with their natural cognitive rhythms.</p><p>Founder and CEO Sameer Yami positions the product as a response to both widespread disengagement and the potential misuse of artificial intelligence. He identifies disengagement as a significant productivity inhibitor and advocates for state-to-task matching as a superior approach to learning, teaching, and working—an methodology he asserts is now practical due to AI advancements. Yami acknowledges that AI can sometimes harm cognitive performance when used to outsource tasks rather than enhance human capabilities.</p><p>The company's methods underwent validation through pilot programs in educational and corporate environments, including a two-year study that involved underserved Title I schools. According to Augment Me, their system demonstrated measurable improvements in focus, stress reduction, and academic performance, with standardized test scores exceeding national growth benchmarks by 100–400 points in certain instances. The startup gained recognition as a Top 200 contender at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://techcrunch.com/</a> Disrupt Battlefield, with the release of WotNow?! representing a significant milestone in their mission to redefine human-AI interaction.</p><p>Beyond individual coaching applications, Augment Me is developing room-level attention sensing capabilities. This technology will analyze engagement patterns across environments such as classrooms or conference rooms, providing presenters with real-time feedback on audience retention and strategies to re-engage distracted participants. This expansion into collective attention monitoring could transform how educational institutions and businesses optimize engagement and productivity in group settings.</p>
