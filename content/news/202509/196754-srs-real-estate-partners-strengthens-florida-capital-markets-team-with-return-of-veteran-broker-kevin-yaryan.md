<p>SRS Real Estate Partners has announced the return of Kevin Yaryan as Senior Vice President on the Capital Markets team in Florida, bringing over 20 years of experience in Florida and California commercial real estate markets. Yaryan's specialization in shopping centers and net lease properties positions him as a key asset for the firm's expanding Florida operations, particularly given his experience leading hundreds of transactions through significant economic challenges including the Great Recession, COVID-19 pandemic, and recent inflationary conditions.</p><p>Yaryan's return to SRS from his previous role as managing partner at Sun Realty Partners represents a strategic move for both the executive and the firm. His extensive background includes previous positions at Equity Investment Services, Marcus & Millichap, and the Orlando office of SRS where he worked until 2023. As a University of Southern California business graduate, Yaryan has developed a reputation for maximizing seller value while identifying strategic opportunities for buyers through his deep understanding of deal intricacies and ability to provide tailored solutions.</p><p>Patrick Nutt, Senior Managing Principal at SRS Capital Markets, emphasized the significance of this appointment, stating that Yaryan's deep market knowledge, proven leadership, and dedication to client success make him an invaluable addition to the team. This move underscores SRS Real Estate Partners' commitment to growing its national Capital Markets platform and strengthening its Florida presence, building upon the retail foundation established since 1986 to provide comprehensive commercial real estate solutions.</p><p>The return of such an experienced professional during current market conditions signals SRS's confidence in the Florida commercial real estate market's resilience and growth potential. For business leaders and investors, this development suggests increased transaction capability and market intelligence available through SRS's expanded team, potentially leading to more sophisticated deal structuring and market insights for retail property transactions throughout the state.</p>
