<p>Tracy Miller, the sleep innovator behind Inventive Sleep®, has launched the Wedge Collection, a suite of four purpose-driven pillow designs engineered to solve specific sleep challenges that disrupt rest and relaxation. The collection marks a shift from decorative-meets-functional pillows to performance-driven wedges focused purely on functional sleep support.</p><p>Every wedge in this collection was designed with purpose to solve a real frustration that disrupts rest, according to Miller. These are the overlooked details that make or break good sleep. By focusing on these challenges, the company has created products that feel inventive, personal, and essential for consumers seeking improved sleep quality.</p><p>The collection includes the No-Gap Stacker Wedge, which eliminates the space between mattress and headboard while providing a supportive base for decorative pillows. For side sleepers, the Side Sleeper Wedge features a U-shaped contour that cradles the head and neck while creating space for the arm, reducing shoulder compression and pressure. Each Side Sleeper Wedge includes a bonus personal-sized memory foam pillow perfect for travel.</p><p>The Adjustable Back Rest Wedge offers versatile total-body comfort with a detachable neck roll and adjustable elastic strap for customizable positioning. Engineered for stomach sleepers, the Stomach Sleeper Comfort Wedge is a two-piece design that relieves pressure on skin and neck while providing stable support through its armrest and face cutout design.</p><p>For retailers, the collection creates opportunities to diversify assortments with function-first products that expand the definition of sleep wellness. The wedges also have applications in healthcare, institutional, and spa settings, naturally extending into chiropractic offices, physical therapy clinics, and hospital recovery programs. The collection bridges the gap between clinical support, restorative wellness, and everyday comfort, offering consumers smarter ways to sleep, relax, and recharge.
