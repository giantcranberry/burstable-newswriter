<p>Mawson Infrastructure Group Inc. has issued a comprehensive corporate update addressing several key operational and financial matters. The technology company, which provides digital infrastructure for high-performance computing and digital assets, confirmed that it continues to operate normally across its U.S. footprint, with its Midland, Pennsylvania facility remaining a cornerstone operation supported by long-term site tenure.</p><p>The company has engaged advisors and presented a plan to Nasdaq to regain compliance with the exchange's continued listing standards. Mawson recently received an extension of time from Nasdaq to maintain its listing while working toward full compliance. This development comes as the company advances efforts to resolve certain legacy legal matters as part of a broader program to strengthen its balance sheet and improve financial stability.</p><p>Mawson has maintained financial flexibility through the filing of a new shelf registration statement on Form S-3, replacing its previous expired registration. Company leadership emphasized that filing the shelf registration statement does not indicate immediate issuance of new common stock shares nor represents a change in the company's business strategy or financial condition. The updated company presentation is available on the corporate website at <a href="https://www.mawsoninc.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.mawsoninc.com</a>.</p><p>The corporate update underscores Mawson's ongoing commitment to executing its growth strategy while maintaining operational flexibility. The company's digital infrastructure platforms serve artificial intelligence, high-performance computing, digital assets, and other computing applications, with a strategic focus on prioritizing carbon-free energy sources including nuclear energy to power its computational operations.</p>
