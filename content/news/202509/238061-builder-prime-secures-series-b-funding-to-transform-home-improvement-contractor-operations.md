<p>Builder Prime, the comprehensive business management platform designed specifically for home improvement contractors, has completed its Series B funding round led by Blueprint Equity. The investment will accelerate the company's mission to eliminate operational chaos for contractors by providing a unified platform that transforms how they manage operations, customer relationships, and business growth.</p><p>The home improvement industry, valued at over $400 billion annually, has historically struggled with technology adoption as contractors typically juggle multiple disconnected tools including spreadsheets for estimates, separate apps for scheduling, different systems for customer communication, and manual payment processes. Builder Prime addresses this fragmentation by consolidating CRM, estimating, project management, payments, reporting, and customer communication into a single intelligent platform that serves as a comprehensive business management solution.</p><p>Currently serving more than 500 contractors nationwide, Builder Prime demonstrated impressive momentum with 100+% year-over-year growth in 2024, positioning it as one of the fastest-growing solutions in the competitive home improvement software landscape. The capital from this funding round will be invested in enhancing customer experience, advancing core product capabilities, and delivering innovations that help contractors harness the power of their operational data.</p><p>Rather than implementing generic artificial intelligence solutions, Builder Prime is developing intelligent tools specifically designed to understand the unique challenges contractors face, including seasonal demand fluctuations and complex project coordination requirements. Company founder and CEO Jonathan Weinberg emphasized that this funding allows the company to double down on customer-focused development, creating technology that works as hard as contractors do by providing accurate, real-time data for better business decisions.</p><p>Sheldon Lewis, Managing Partner of Blueprint Equity, highlighted the strategic importance of the investment, noting that the home improvement industry has been waiting for technology that contractors actually want to use rather than merely need to use. Builder Prime has successfully addressed this market need by proving that sophisticated software can be both powerful and intuitive, even for contractors who may not consider themselves particularly tech-savvy.
