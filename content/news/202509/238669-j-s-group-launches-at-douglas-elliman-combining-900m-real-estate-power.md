<p>The formation of the J&S Group at Douglas Elliman represents a significant consolidation of talent within South Florida's competitive luxury real estate market. Cousins Jaclyn Bild and Sari Libbin Shapiro have united their individual careers, bringing together a combined sales volume exceeding $900 million to establish one of the region's most dynamic new real estate teams.</p><p>Jay Phillip Parker, CEO of Brokerage, Florida Region and President of Douglas Elliman Development Marketing, Florida, emphasized the strategic importance of this partnership. Their new team reflects both their history of achievement and a clear vision for the futureâ€”one that blends local insight with global reach. We are proud to support their growth and look forward to the impact the J&S Group will make within Douglas Elliman and the entire South Florida market.</p><p>Both agents have been individually ranked among the top 1.5% of real estate professionals nationwide by RealTrends + Tom Ferry America's Best List as featured in The Wall Street Journal annually since 2022. They have consistently earned the prestigious Pinnacle Award for placing in the Top 3% at Douglas Elliman. The J&S Group specializes in property sales across South Miami, Coral Gables, Coconut Grove, Miami Beach, Edgewater and North Bay Village, providing clients with personalized access and expert guidance in the region's most sought-after luxury markets.</p><p>The launch coincides with the duo celebrating ten years at Douglas Elliman, evolving from individual top producers into one family-driven team. Both Miami natives are guided by the philosophy The Luxury of Local, which they believe gives clients a competitive advantage that only true locals can provide. Being born and raised here, we are privileged to understand this city and its neighborhoods on a deeper level. That perspective allows us to guide our clients with insight and authenticity that can't be replicated, Shapiro explained.</p><p>Bild brings substantial financial expertise to the partnership, having earned dual degrees in Finance and Marketing from Washington University in St. Louis before beginning her career advising high-net-worth individuals in New York City. Her career is distinguished by recognition in Douglas Elliman's 2024 Ellie Awards, where she ranked #13 in GCI, #24 nationally and #15 in Florida and is recognized as the #10 Latin Agent Nationwide by Sales Volume by NAHREP.</p><p>Shapiro has built her career through deep market knowledge and an impressive track record in both luxury resales and pre-construction. Since entering real estate in 2015, she has played a pivotal role in selling some of Miami's most iconic new developments, including <a href="https://www.mrccoconutgrove.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Mr. C Residences Coconut Grove</a> and <a href="https://www.villamiami.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">VILLA MIAMI</a> in Edgewater. She also brings valuable experience from Douglas Elliman's Sports & Entertainment Division, where she has successfully worked with professional athletes including several NBA players.</p><p>Together, the J&S Group has demonstrated market dominance, having sold more resales than any other agent at Mr. C Residences Coconut Grove since the building's opening last summer. Their combination of deep community ties, complementary professional strengths, and shared Miami heritage positions them to deliver exceptional results for luxury clients while shaping a new legacy within one of real estate's most prestigious firms.</p>
