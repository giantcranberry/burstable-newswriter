<p>Dogtopia has opened a new location in Norfolk at 118 W 21st St, bringing comprehensive canine care services to the community. The 7,500-square-foot facility offers award-winning dog daycare, boarding, and spa services alongside a full Earthwise pet nutrition store providing high-quality pet foods and wellness products.</p><p>The Norfolk-Ghent location is owned and operated by the Sutelan family, longtime dog lovers with diverse professional backgrounds who discovered the brand through a radio advertisement. Chip Sutelan, Barbara Sutelan, Rachel Sutelan, Edward Sutelan, and Mary Pyle bring their combined experience in entrepreneurship, education, and business management to create a welcoming environment for both dogs and their owners.</p><p>Dogtopia sets industry standards with its focus on three key benefits: socialization, exercise, and education. Dogs enjoy supervised play with like-minded companions in climate-controlled playrooms grouped by size and play style, all under the supervision of professionally trained Canine Coaches. The facility features compressed rubber flooring to reduce impact on dogs' paws and joints, prioritizing safety in every aspect of operation.</p><p>New customers can take advantage of limited-time promotions, including $79 per week unlimited daycare for a full year and bonus days with multi-day weekly plans. The facility operates from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. Monday through Friday and 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. on weekends, providing flexible scheduling options for pet parents.</p><p>Beyond local services, Dogtopia operates the <a href="https://www.dogtopiafoundation.org" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Dogtopia Foundation</a>, a nonprofit organization that funds programs focused on service dogs for veterans, therapy dogs for students, and employment initiatives for adults with autism. One hundred percent of funds raised are donated directly to supported organizations, extending the company's impact beyond immediate community services.</p><p>The Sutelan family plans to host a grand opening event in October to celebrate with local pet parents and their dogs, further establishing the facility as a community hub for canine wellness and owner education. The combination of professional dog care services, premium nutrition products, and charitable initiatives positions Dogtopia as a comprehensive resource for Norfolk-Ghent's pet community.</p>
