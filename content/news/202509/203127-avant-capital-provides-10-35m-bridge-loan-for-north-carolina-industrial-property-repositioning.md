<p>Avant Capital, a Connecticut-based commercial real estate bridge lender, has originated a $10,350,000 bridge loan secured by a 70,481-square-foot industrial flex property in Morrisville, North Carolina. The property, originally constructed in 1998 and most recently used as a call center, will undergo significant repositioning under the sponsorship of Capstone Equities affiliate.</p><p>The Raleigh-Durham industrial and flex market continues to experience strong demand driven by population growth, limited supply, and expanding e-commerce and logistics needs. Loan proceeds will finance the property acquisition, fund a planned renovation program, and provide time for the borrower to reposition the building into small industrial suites under the Portal Warehousing brand, Capstone Equities' specialized co-warehousing platform.</p><p>Adam Luysterborghs, Managing Principal of Avant, stated that this transaction demonstrates the company's ability to deliver flexible capital solutions to experienced sponsors with innovative strategies. The company is targeting similar projects ranging from $1 million to $75 million nationwide in 2025, with focus on high-growth markets including Texas, Florida, North Carolina, Georgia, Colorado, and Tennessee.

The conversion of the former call center into co-warehousing space represents a strategic adaptation to market demands, particularly the need for smaller, more adaptable industrial units that serve the expanding e-commerce and logistics sectors.</p><p>The transaction reflects broader trends in commercial real estate lending, where bridge financing enables property repositioning and value-add strategies in markets experiencing strong fundamentals. Avant Capital's focus on bridge loans and non-performing loans secured by commercial properties, particularly apartments and industrial assets, positions the company to capitalize on these market opportunities while supporting sponsors with innovative redevelopment visions.</p>
