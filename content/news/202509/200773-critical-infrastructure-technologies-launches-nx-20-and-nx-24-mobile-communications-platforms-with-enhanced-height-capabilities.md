<p>Critical Infrastructure Technologies Ltd. (CSE: CTTT) has announced significant advancements in its mobile communications platforms with the release of NX-20 and NX-24 models, featuring extended operational heights that improve network reliability and transmission range for critical operations. The new systems can lift payload equipment to 20 meters, with an optional extension reaching 24 meters, representing a major improvement in addressing terrain challenges and environmental obstacles.</p><p>The enhanced height capabilities allow the NX-20 to transmit to network nodes up to 18.4 kilometers away on flat terrain, substantially reducing the impact of tree cover and built environments on network effectiveness. This development opens new opportunities for mobile, flexible communications in challenging operational environments where reliable connectivity is essential for mission success. According to CEO Brenton Scott, "Height is the most important factor in network reliability and flexibility. With the NX-20 and NX-24, CiTech continues to push the boundaries of operational capability, providing our partners with next-generation solutions for mission-critical communications."</p><p>Key engineering achievements behind this advancement include further development of CiTech's patented deployment mechanism to increase load capacity while maintaining core mechanical principles. The addition of a second trapezoidal screw drive enhances deployment stability, with collateral benefits also improving the weight capacity of the existing NX-16 model. The company has also integrated support for VTOL fixed-wing surveillance drones, extending effective intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance coverage for defense and security applications. Additional information about the company's technology can be found at <a href="https://www.citech.com.au" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.citech.com.au</a>.</p><p>These developments build on stakeholder collaboration in Australia and Europe, reflecting CiTech's focus on delivering robust, versatile systems that adapt to evolving customer needs. The NX-20 can lift up to 100kg of payload equipment to the new 20-meter height, significantly expanding the system's transmission capabilities. Scott added, "Our focus is on delivering robust, versatile systems that adapt to the evolving needs of our customers. The NX-20 and NX-24 demonstrate CiTech's commitment to innovation in critical infrastructure and communications." The technology targets multiple sectors including mining, defense, border security, surveillance, and emergency services where reliable mobile telecommunications are essential for operational success.</p>
