<p>Sunlight Solutions will demonstrate its AI-powered insurance platform at InsureTech Connect (ITC) Vegas 2025, offering attendees live demonstrations of how embedded intelligence is transforming the insurance lifecycle. The event, scheduled for October 14-16 at Mandalay Bay in Las Vegas, will feature Sunlight's technology at Booth #2224, where visitors can experience firsthand how artificial intelligence enhances core insurance operations.</p><p>The company will showcase Sunlight Enterprise Boosted with Intelligence, a platform that integrates AI across insurance workflows to deliver smarter operations and real-time insights for carriers, MGAs, and brokers. Demonstration highlights include comprehensive policy management systems covering quoting, issuance, and renewals, along with billing solutions that incorporate payment processing and audit support. The claims management component features first notice of loss (FNOL), adjudication, and resolution workflows designed to streamline insurance operations.</p><p>Florence Lamour, Chief Product and Sales Enablement Officer, emphasized the practical value of the demonstrations. "Our demos are designed to show—not just tell—how Sunlight can unlock real value for insurers," Lamour stated. "We've built a system that doesn't just record data—it acts on it, intelligently and proactively." The platform includes Sunny, an AI assistant that helps users navigate the system, retrieve contextual data, and identify coverage gaps through conversational interfaces.</p><p>Key technological features demonstrated will include a risk scoring engine that provides real-time evaluation of customer risk profiles using both external and internal data sources. The intelligent document processing capability automates data extraction from uploaded documents, streamlining processes for quoting, claims intake, and customer onboarding. John Morey, Director of Business Development USA, highlighted the company's implementation success, noting "100% successful implementation of our projects" and a "pragmatic, results-driven approach that ensures our clients get value fast."</p><p>Attendees will have opportunities to engage directly with Sunlight's product leaders, engineers, and sales executives to discuss modernization strategies for legacy systems. The company will also host a Soccer Penalty Shot Challenge in the LATAM zone on October 16th from 2:00-3:30 PM, providing an informal setting for networking and conversation. The demonstrations aim to illustrate how AI integration can address industry challenges while maintaining operational efficiency and customer service excellence.</p>
