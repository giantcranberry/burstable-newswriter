<p>Vertical Aerospace has secured manufacturing sites to support certification and early production of its electric vertical take-off and landing aircraft, representing a critical advancement in electric aviation commercialization. The company will establish aircraft assembly at an expanded Cotswold Airport site, featuring a new facility adjacent to its existing Flight Test Centre with capacity to produce more than 25 VX4 aircraft annually.</p><p>Battery production will occur at an expanded Avonmouth site adjacent to Vertical's existing Energy Centre, where a new 30,000 square foot battery facility will triple production capacity. This facility will provide production capacity into 2030 and increases Vertical's total Energy Centre footprint to approximately 45,000 square feet. Locating both facilities alongside existing operations reduces integration risk and enables a seamless ramp from prototype through certification.</p><p>The company reaffirmed its plan to certify the all-electric VX4 by 2028, requiring $700 million in funding to reach this milestone. Vertical's focused OEM business model, low operating costs relative to the industry, and efficient manufacturing plans enable this certification timeline. The collaborative approach of aviation authorities on eVTOL certification safety standards front-loads the certification process and minimizes late-stage surprises.</p><p>Vertical provided updated financial targets for 2030 and beyond, reflecting momentum over the past year. The company now projects at least 175 aircraft delivered cumulatively by 2030, compared to prior guidance of at least 150. Manufacturing run-rate is expected to exceed 225 units annually by Q4 2030, with plans to scale to target annual aircraft deliveries of 900 in 2035. Additional materials and financial projections are available on https://investors.vertical-aerospace.com.</p><p>The company remains on track to complete transition testing by the end of 2025 and will begin hybrid-electric flight testing in 2026. Transition testing will demonstrate the VX4's ability to shift seamlessly between vertical lift and wingborne flight, representing the defining capability of tiltrotor eVTOLs. Completion of this testing will mark a major technical achievement and key de-risking milestone on the path to certification and revenue generation.</p><p>For business and technology leaders, Vertical Aerospace's manufacturing expansion signals the maturation of electric aviation infrastructure and provides a concrete timeline for commercial eVTOL operations. The increased production targets and detailed financial projections demonstrate growing confidence in market adoption and operational scalability, potentially accelerating the entire electric aviation industry's development timeline.</p>
