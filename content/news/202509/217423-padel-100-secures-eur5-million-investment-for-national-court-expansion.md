<p>Padel 100, Ireland's fastest-growing padel operator, has announced a €5 million capital raise under the Employment Investment Incentive Scheme to fund an ambitious expansion that will see 300 courts installed across the country by December 2027. This initiative represents a significant milestone in Ireland's adoption of the rapidly growing sport, with installations beginning this month at a rate of 10-12 courts monthly.</p><p>The investment structure offers compelling incentives for early participants, with investments completed before November 15, 2025 qualifying for 50% EIIS income tax relief, while investments made after Padel 100 begins trading on November 16, 2025 will receive 35% tax relief. The company has already confirmed more than 40 venues for court installations and expects to have 100 new courts operational by April 2026, positioning Ireland among Europe's fastest-emerging padel markets for the first time.</p><p>CEO and Founder Ben Keohane emphasized the concrete nature of the expansion, stating that this initiative signals a transformative moment in Ireland's padel journey. The rollout is supported by strategic partnerships with industry leaders including <a href="https://www.acentagroup.se" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Acenta Group</a> from Sweden, <a href="https://www.playtomic.io" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Playtomic</a>, and <a href="https://www.nxpadel.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">NXPadel</a>, bringing world-class construction expertise, booking technology, and court materials to Ireland's developing padel infrastructure.</p><p>The financial proposition for investors includes a 40% fixed return over four years with full capital repayment at Year 4, plus bonus royalty income for investments of €50,000 or more. A €10,000 investment is projected to deliver €19,000 back over four years, representing an effective Internal Rate of Return of nearly 50%. The company forecasts that its national network will host more than 800,000 annual player sessions by 2026, generating over €11 million in revenue.</p><p>This expansion comes as padel continues its global ascent, with 7,000 new courts built worldwide in 2024 alone and the sport maintaining a remarkable 92% player retention rate. With Olympic inclusion on the horizon, Padel 100's rapid rollout positions Ireland at the forefront of this international sporting movement. The company's ambitious timeline and strategic partnerships demonstrate a commitment to building the infrastructure necessary to support Ireland's growing interest in what has become the world's fastest-growing sport.</p>
