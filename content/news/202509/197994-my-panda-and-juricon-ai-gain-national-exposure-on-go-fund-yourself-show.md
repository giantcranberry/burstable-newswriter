<p>My Panda and Juricon.ai, two early-stage ventures addressing everyday challenges through technology, were featured on Season 3, Episode 5 of Go Fund Yourself, airing on <a href="https://cheddar.tv" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Cheddar TV</a>. The exposure provides these companies with invaluable visibility, direct feedback from seasoned investors, and opportunities for accelerated growth through increased customer interest and investor outreach.</p><p>My Panda, or Personal Assistants Next Door App, connects users to local helpers for errands, pet care, or household chores, aiming to strengthen community ties while creating flexible jobs. Already recognized by programs at Georgia Tech, Emory University, and the City of Atlanta, the company is poised for expansion, using the national stage to demonstrate how its model can scale into other regions. Appearing on <a href="https://cheddar.tv/go-fund-yourself" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Go Fund Yourself</a> allows My Panda to showcase its community-driven approach, leveraging technology to revive the concept of neighborhood support.</p><p>Juricon.ai, launched under parent company LawyerUp Holdings, uses artificial intelligence to streamline legal matchmaking by matching users with attorneys based on real-world case experience. This innovation delivers higher-quality leads for lawyers and better outcomes for clients, operating at the intersection of B2C and B2B markets. Early traction in 2025 positions Juricon as a potential disruptor in the legal services industry, and presenting on the show helps validate its business model to a broader audience. The exposure on Cheddar TV could accelerate its growth by attracting more users and investors interested in AI-powered platforms.</p><p>The importance of this appearance lies in the strategic acceleration it offers for startups navigating early growth phases. With investor interest high in community-driven solutions and AI technologies, Go Fund Yourself serves as more than a competitionâ€”it is a platform for mentorship, scaling strategies, and long-term sustainability. For founders, this momentum can open doors that might otherwise take years to access, emphasizing why national exposure is crucial for innovation-driven ventures.</p>
