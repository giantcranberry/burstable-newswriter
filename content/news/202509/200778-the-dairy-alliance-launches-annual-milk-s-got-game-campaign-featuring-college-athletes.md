<p>The Dairy Alliance has launched its annual Milk's Got Game campaign, featuring University of Georgia athletes Gunner Stockton and Talyn Taylor along with University of Tennessee quarterback Jake Merklinger. The campaign showcases how real dairy milk powers athletic performance through strength, recovery, and hydration. The nonprofit organization, funded by Southeast dairy farm families, emphasizes milk's role as a natural sports drink that has supported these athletes from childhood through their college careers.</p><p>According to Joanne Engelhardt-Risko, Vice President of Strategic Marketing at The Dairy Alliance, "Real dairy milk fueled these athletes while they were growing up, and it continues to power their routines today. With this year's Milk's Got Game campaign, we're spotlighting the evolution of real dairy milk as a powerful sports drink that helps athletes recover, stay strong, and perform at their best." The campaign specifically highlights milk's nutritional profile, noting that each serving contains 8 grams of high-quality protein that supports athletic needs from practice to game day.</p><p>The athletes participating in the campaign shared personal accounts of milk's role in their development and current routines. University of Georgia quarterback Gunner Stockton stated, "Growing up, my mom always made sure milk was part of my everyday routine. It gave me the nutrition needed for practice and helped me push harder on the field. Even now, dairy milk plays a central role in my life, keeping me fueled and hydrated through every game." His mother, Sherrie Stockton, added, "Since his first steps, it's always been real dairy â€“ high-quality protein and real hydration."</p><p>University of Georgia wide receiver Talyn Taylor emphasized milk's ongoing benefits, saying, "Real dairy milk gave me the edge when I was training as a kid, and it still makes a difference for me now. My mom knew the importance of it early on, and I rely on it to stay strong, bounce back, and perform at my best." Similarly, Tennessee quarterback Jake Merklinger noted, "From the start, real dairy milk played a huge role in keeping me energized and ready to go. My mom made sure it was part of my routine growing up, and it's still one of the best ways for me to recover after workouts and stay game ready."</p><p>The campaign also features dairy farmers from the Southeast region who support the initiative. Samantha Craun, a Tennessee dairy farmer, expressed pride in joining The Dairy Alliance to support the Southeast dairy industry, while Georgia dairy farmer Jennifer Glover emphasized milk's nutritional delivery "from our farms to your family." The Milk's Got Game campaign celebrates the connection between family, nutrition, and athletic performance, positioning real dairy milk as essential for athletes at all levels.
