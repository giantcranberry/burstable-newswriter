<p>President Donald Trump stated Tuesday that he would order federal troops to Baltimore to combat crime, continuing weeks of public disputes with Governor Wes Moore. However, Trump's remarks were unclear, and the White House did not clarify his intentions. This follows his similar threat to send troops to Chicago, which both Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker and Moore have vowed to resist.</p><p>A federal judge in California recently ruled that Trump's deployment of National Guard troops and U.S. Marines to address immigration protests in Los Angeles violated federal law prohibiting military involvement in domestic law enforcement. This ruling, as reported by Scott Maucione of <a href="https://www.wypr.org" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">WYPR-FM</a>, could set a precedent affecting potential deployments in Baltimore, highlighting legal barriers to such actions.</p><p>Amid these tensions, Governor Moore faced criticism after The Daily Mail reported he was photographed on actor and Democratic megadonor George Clooney's boat in Italy during a vacation to celebrate his wife's 50th birthday. Moore's office confirmed he paid for the trip and stayed at Clooney's home, with Maryland State Police troopers providing security. The governor did not temporarily transfer power to Lieutenant Governor Aruna Miller, as he was not unable to perform his duties.</p><p>In other state news, a wind developer announced plans to proceed with a steel manufacturing facility at Sparrows Point for a Maryland offshore wind farm, despite the federal government withdrawing a $47.4 million grant. Additionally, 980 state employees applied for a voluntary separation program aimed at reducing government size and expenses, and Maryland joined 21 states and Washington D.C. in supporting federal labor unions suing to block Trump's executive order canceling collective bargaining agreements.</p><p>Baltimore County voters will decide on a charter amendment to create an independent board for appointing the inspector general, approved unanimously by the County Council. These developments underscore ongoing political, legal, and administrative challenges in Maryland, with Trump's troop deployment threat representing a significant federal-state conflict with implications for governance and civil liberties.</p>
