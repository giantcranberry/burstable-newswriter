<p>The recent Presidential Proclamation instituting a substantial one-time fee of US$100,000 for new H-1B visa holders entering the United States has created significant uncertainty for employers navigating the global talent market. While the policy aims to incentivize domestic hiring, it accelerates the need for cost-effective and compliant international workforce solutions that can help companies maintain competitive access to skilled professionals worldwide.</p><p>The new regulation significantly increases the cost and complexity of relocating international talent to the U.S., particularly impacting small and medium-sized enterprises and startups with limited budgets. In response, businesses are increasingly likely to adopt remote hiring models, engaging talent directly in their home countries to circumvent the hefty fee and intricate visa processes. This shift drives demand for Employer of Record and international payroll outsourcing services that allow companies to legally employ staff abroad without establishing a local entity.</p><p>Galaxy Payroll Group Limited has enhanced its service offerings by supporting payroll settlements in stablecoins, providing companies with a more efficient, transparent, and cost-effective solution for managing cross-border payroll. By leveraging stablecoins through services available at <a href="https://www.galaxypayrollgroup.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">their platform</a>, the company helps businesses reduce risks associated with currency fluctuations and streamline international payroll processes for remote employees.</p><p>As companies build more distributed teams, the need for streamlined, transparent, and efficient cross-border payroll management becomes critical. The policy presents challenges for companies of all sizes, from SMEs to large multinational corporations that employ significant numbers of H-1B visa holders. Comprehensive service suites including EOR, international payroll outsourcing, and stablecoin settlements offer scalable solutions tailored to meet diverse business needs while ensuring regulatory compliance across multiple jurisdictions.</p><p>The growing demand for efficient, compliant, and cost-effective international workforce management solutions reflects a broader shift in how companies approach global talent acquisition. Specialized payroll providers are positioned to help organizations navigate the complex employment landscape while maintaining access to skilled professionals worldwide, ensuring businesses remain competitive despite increasing regulatory hurdles and costs associated with traditional relocation models.</p>
