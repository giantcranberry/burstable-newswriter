<p>Colovore announced that Michael Fulkerson, Vice President of Facilities & Operations, will participate in a featured panel at the <a href="https://www.dicewest.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">DICE Data Center Management, Operations & Cooling-West conference</a> in Santa Clara on October 2, 2025. The panel titled "The Future of Data Center Cooling: How Will High Density Chips Impact Cooling and Power Infrastructure?" will address the escalating technical challenges facing data center operators as GPU densities approach 1000kW per rack.</p><p>This exponential increase in power density requires rethinking every aspect of facility design, from heat rejection and cooling efficiency to power delivery and long-term scalability. The discussion will explore how leading organizations are preparing for these near-term realities and what innovations are necessary to sustain the next wave of digital infrastructure growth. Panelists include representatives from major technology companies including Colovore, Google, BP, Wesco, Equinix, and CoolIT Systems.</p><p>The implications of these discussions are significant for the entire technology industry, as the ability to effectively cool high-density computing infrastructure directly impacts the advancement of artificial intelligence, machine learning, and high-performance computing applications. As chips continue to increase in power and density, traditional air cooling methods become insufficient, necessitating advanced liquid-cooling technologies and completely reimagined facility designs.</p><p>The conference session will provide valuable insights into how data center operators are adapting to support the massive computational requirements of modern AI workloads. The shift toward liquid-cooled infrastructure represents a fundamental transformation in data center design philosophy, moving away from conventional approaches that can no longer support the thermal management needs of next-generation hardware.</p><p>This industry-wide challenge affects not only data center providers but also enterprises deploying AI solutions, cloud service providers, and technology companies developing advanced computing hardware. The solutions developed today will determine the scalability and sustainability of digital infrastructure for years to come, making these discussions critical for the future of technological innovation.</p>
