<p>South Fork Instruments announced the availability of Exner's EXspect turbidity sensors designed to enhance cleaning-in-place operations in dairy processing facilities. The sensors provide reproducible turbidity measurement that reduces product loss, lowers water and chemical consumption, and ensures compliance with 3A and EHEDG standards.</p><p>According to John Daly, Technical Director at South Fork Instruments, traditional methods like timers and sight glasses leave dairy processors uncertain about when milk has been properly flushed out or when rinse water reaches sufficient cleanliness. The EXspect sensors enable processors to make these critical transitions based on accurate, real-time turbidity values, resulting in measurable savings in product recovery and effluent charges.</p><p>The sensor technology offers sub-second detection of product-to-water and water-to-detergent transitions, with a measurement range covering up to 300,000 NTU, which accommodates everything from rinse water through cream. This rapid response capability allows dairy plants to optimize their cleaning cycles precisely, reducing both resource waste and operational downtime.</p><p>Constructed from 316L stainless steel with sapphire optics, the EXspect sensors are engineered to withstand repeated cleaning and sterilization cycles. They feature sterilization resistance up to 140Â°C for 120 minutes during steam-in-place cycles and are available with Tri-Clamp and other hygienic connection options. The sensors achieve better than 1% reproducibility of full scale, ensuring consistent performance across multiple cleaning cycles.</p><p>The implementation of these sensors addresses significant operational challenges in dairy processing, where inefficient cleaning procedures can lead to substantial product loss and environmental compliance issues. By providing objective data rather than relying on visual inspections or timed intervals, the technology represents a shift toward data-driven process optimization in food manufacturing.</p><p>South Fork Instruments, serving as the distributor for Exner EXspect turbidity sensors in the Americas, provides application expertise and integration services to support dairy processors in implementing this technology. The company's cross-industry experience in measurement instrumentation positions them to help facilities maximize the benefits of the sensor technology across various processing applications.</p>
