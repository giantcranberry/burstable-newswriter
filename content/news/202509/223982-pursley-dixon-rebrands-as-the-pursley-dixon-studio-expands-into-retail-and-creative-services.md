<p>The acclaimed architectural and interior design firm formerly known as Pursley Dixon has unveiled its next chapter as The Pursley Dixon Studio, marking its 20th anniversary with a strategic rebranding that paves the way for expansion into new creative disciplines. Founded in Charlotte, North Carolina in 2005 by architect Ken Pursley, the firm has evolved from a small architectural practice into a nationally recognized studio known for its collaborative approach to residential design.</p><p>The rebranding represents both an acknowledgment of two decades of successful collaboration and a strategic positioning for future growth in the design industry. As Pursley noted, the new name honors all who contribute their talents to the work and reflects the creative studio the organization has become. The firm's evolution includes key milestones such as the addition of Craig Dixon as partner in 2012 and the 2020 expansion into interior design under Bronwyn Ford, who became a partner that same year.</p><p>Recent leadership changes have further shaped the studio's direction, with Day Palmer appointed Chief Operating Officer in 2023 and Mark Kline taking on the role of principal architect and creative consultant in 2024. Under the new branding, Palmer is being elevated to partner while continuing to lead operations and marketing. These structural changes demonstrate the firm's commitment to maintaining its collaborative spirit while scaling operations.</p><p>The most significant development accompanying the rebrand is the launch of ITO, a curated online retail concept led by Bronwyn Ford. This venture represents the studio's first major diversification beyond service-based offerings. ITO will bring together rare and resonant elements for the home across various price points, extending the firm's design philosophy to product retail. The move signals a strategic response to growing consumer demand for curated home goods from established design authorities.</p><p>The Pursley Dixon Studio's expansion comes at a time when the residential design industry is experiencing increased demand for integrated services. With a portfolio that includes award-winning residences across the country and national design accolades, the firm has established credibility that positions it well for this growth phase. Their participation in notable showhouses such as the <a href="https://kipsbaydecoratorshowhouse.org" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Kips Bay Dallas Showhouse</a> in 2023 and their celebrated book Finding Home: The Houses of Pursley Dixon published by Rizzoli demonstrate their industry standing.</p><p>For business leaders observing the design sector, The Pursley Dixon Studio's transformation offers insights into successful scaling strategies for creative firms. The integration of additional creative services that align with their core offerings suggests a deliberate approach to expansion that maintains brand integrity. The firm maintains its online presence at <a href="https://www.pursleydixon.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.pursleydixon.com</a> where clients can view their extensive portfolio of residential projects spanning multiple states.</p><p>The rebranding and expansion initiatives reflect broader trends in the design industry where established firms are leveraging their reputations to enter adjacent markets. By staying true to its Build Beautiful Things mission while evolving its business model, The Pursley Dixon Studio provides a case study in balancing creative integrity with strategic growth. This approach may influence how other design firms approach diversification and scaling in an increasingly competitive market.</p>
