<p>Mitch Gould, founder and CEO of Nutritional Products International, has built a retail career spanning more than three decades, connecting him to nearly every major retailer in America. From <a href="https://www.walmart.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Walmart</a> and <a href="https://www.costco.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Costco</a> to 7-Eleven, CVS, and Home Depot, Gould has worked alongside retail giants to launch and expand brands into the U.S. market.</p><p>Gould has represented or partnered with retailers including Walgreens, Albertsons, Vitamin Shoppe, Menards, Safeway, Meijer, Lowes, and Circle K. His extensive network demonstrates the critical infrastructure required for successful brand placement in competitive retail environments. The strategic importance of such distribution expertise cannot be overstated in today's complex retail ecosystem.</p><p>One notable achievement was Gould's partnership with actor Steven Seagal to create the Lightning Bolt Energy Drink, which reached shelves at Walmart and 7-11 nationwide in under a yearâ€”an unprecedented timeline in the beverage industry. This demonstrates the efficiency and impact of strategic retail distribution partnerships that can accelerate time-to-market significantly.</p><p>Long before Amazon became the retail powerhouse it is today, Gould played a pivotal role in expanding its health, wellness, and sports nutrition categories. He helped place more than 150 health and nutrition brands on their platform, including category leaders like BSN, MuscleTech, Optimum Nutrition, and CytoSport. This early work with emerging digital platforms shows foresight in retail channel diversification.</p><p>Supporting NPI's retail distribution model is its sister company, InHealth Media, a marketing and communications agency founded by Gould. IHM specializes in high-impact visibility campaigns including national TV tagging, influencer programs, PR outreach, and digital strategies that drive awareness and consumer engagement.</p><p>Together, NPI and IHM provide manufacturers with a turnkey solution for launching, marketing, and sustaining their brands in the U.S. market. This integrated approach addresses the complex challenges of FDA compliance, logistics, sales, and marketing that international and domestic manufacturers face when entering the American retail landscape.</p><p>Now entering his fourth decade in the retail industry, Gould remains actively engaged in global commerce, connecting with manufacturers and brand developers worldwide. His ongoing work demonstrates the continuing importance of experienced retail distribution expertise in an increasingly complex and competitive market environment where established relationships and operational knowledge provide significant competitive advantages.</p>
