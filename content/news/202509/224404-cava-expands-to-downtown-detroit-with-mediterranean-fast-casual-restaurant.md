<p>CAVA will open its second Michigan location and first in the Detroit metro area on September 26 at 636 Woodward Ave, marking a significant expansion for the Mediterranean fast-casual restaurant brand. The 3,000-square-foot Detroit location features indoor dining and digital order capabilities as the company continues its national growth strategy targeting at least 1,000 restaurants by 2032. This expansion demonstrates the brand's confidence in urban markets and the growing consumer demand for health-focused, customizable dining options.</p><p>The Detroit opening follows the brand's successful Canton debut this summer, with Chief Development Officer Jeff Gaul noting the company's excitement about bringing Mediterranean flavors and hospitality to the Detroit market. The restaurant's customizable menu offers over 17 billion combinations through chef-curated bowls, pitas, dips, and house-made juices, recently enhanced by the nationwide limited-time introduction of Chicken Shawarma as a new protein option. This level of customization represents a significant trend in the fast-casual industry, where personalization and dietary flexibility are becoming increasingly important to consumers.</p><p>Before the official opening, CAVA maintained its Community Day tradition by hosting an event that raised funds for <a href="https://foodrescue.us" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Food Rescue US â€“ Detroit</a>, a nonprofit organization dedicated to reducing food waste and increasing food access. Since 2019, this companywide program has generated more than $1 million in donations and food contributions focused on addressing food insecurity in local communities. The brand also donated meals prepared during training periods to community members, continuing its national food donation program launched in fall 2023.</p><p>The new Detroit location will employ 25-40 local workers, with CAVA emphasizing competitive pay, benefits including healthcare and paid time off, and career development opportunities. This employment strategy reflects the company's commitment to being not just a restaurant operator but a community partner that invests in local workforce development. The company's expansion into downtown Detroit represents part of its broader growth strategy that recently saw the opening of its 400th location nationwide, bringing CAVA's total footprint to 28 states and the District of Columbia.</p><p>Operating daily from 10:30 a.m. to 10:30 p.m., the Woodward Avenue restaurant demonstrates CAVA's commitment to urban market penetration while maintaining its focus on community engagement. The extended operating hours cater to both lunch and dinner crowds, as well as the downtown business and entertainment districts. The company has announced plans for additional Michigan expansion later this year, indicating continued confidence in the region's reception to Mediterranean fast-casual dining options that combine health-focused meals with bold flavors.</p><p>This expansion comes at a time when the fast-casual segment continues to outperform other restaurant categories, with Mediterranean cuisine showing particular growth potential. CAVA's successful public offering and aggressive expansion plans signal investor confidence in the brand's ability to capture market share in the competitive restaurant industry. The Detroit opening represents not just another location but a strategic move into a major metropolitan market that could serve as a blueprint for future urban expansions across the country.</p>
