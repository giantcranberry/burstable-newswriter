<p>PowerBank Corporation has obtained all required municipal approvals for two 14.4 MW community solar projects in Skaneateles, New York, representing a significant advancement in the state's renewable energy expansion. The projects, which include variances, site plan approval, and a special use permit, are now awaiting final approval from the New York Department of Environmental Conservation before construction can commence.</p><p>The solar installations will be constructed on industrial brownfield sites in Onondaga County within the Finger Lakes region, representing an environmentally beneficial reuse of land with limited economic potential. This approach aligns with New York's Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act goal of achieving 6 GW of solar capacity by 2025. Once operational, the projects will feed clean energy into the grid while providing subscribers with monthly credits on their electricity bills through the community solar model.</p><p>PowerBank Corporation, a developer and owner of renewable energy projects specializing in distributed and community solar initiatives across North America, maintains a portfolio of more than 100 MW of completed projects and a 1 GW development pipeline. The company's progress in Skaneateles demonstrates the growing momentum behind repurposing underutilized industrial land for renewable energy generation, contributing to both environmental sustainability and local economic development. Additional information about the company's developments is available at <a href="https://ibn.fm/yLdyR" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://ibn.fm/yLdyR</a>.</p><p>The advancement of these projects comes at a critical time as New York continues to accelerate its transition to clean energy sources. Community solar projects like these enable residents and businesses to benefit from solar power without installing panels on their own properties, making renewable energy more accessible while supporting the state's ambitious climate targets. The successful development of brownfield sites for solar generation also sets a precedent for similar projects across the state and beyond, potentially unlocking thousands of acres of underutilized land for renewable energy production.</p><p>For business and technology leaders, this development highlights the growing investment opportunities in renewable energy infrastructure and the importance of strategic land repurposing. The community solar model represents an innovative approach to democratizing clean energy access while creating sustainable revenue streams. As states continue to implement aggressive climate policies, projects like these demonstrate how private sector innovation can align with public policy objectives to drive meaningful environmental and economic impact.</p>
