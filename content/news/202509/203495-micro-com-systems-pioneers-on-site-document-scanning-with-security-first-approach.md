<p>Vancouver-based Micro Com Systems has been offering on-site document scanning services since 1992, predating the rise of modern delivery services by decades. The company has operated in Vancouver's document conversion space for 50 years, serving businesses of all sizes that require confidential handling of paper records while preferring the security of having scanning work completed on their own premises.</p><p>The on-site scanning process involves assembling trained teams who arrive with appropriate hardware and reassemble it in the customer's space. Project requirements and timelines dictate the specific metrics and equipment used, with Micro Com able to adjust output to meet client expectations and schedules. Some businesses prefer rapid completion with large teams, while others opt for a slower pace according to their specific needs.</p><p>Micro Com Systems provides all necessary equipment for on-site scanning, requiring only sufficient space for personnel, desks, chairs, and access to the files being digitized. The company offers flexible transfer options for completed scans and metadata, including external hard drives, thumb drives, or DVDs, depending on the client's security requirements.</p><p>The team operates completely autonomously, providing a customized on-site scanning service that meets specific client needs without the need for tipping or additional charges. This approach has positioned Micro Com as an early innovator in bringing professional services directly to business locations, a concept that has since become commonplace through various app-based delivery and service platforms.</p><p>While the majority of Micro Com's clients are comfortable sending materials to the company's Burnaby-based facility, the on-site option addresses the security concerns of businesses that prefer keeping sensitive documents within their own controlled environments throughout the digitization process. This security-first approach demonstrates the company's understanding of evolving data protection needs in an increasingly digital business landscape.</p>
