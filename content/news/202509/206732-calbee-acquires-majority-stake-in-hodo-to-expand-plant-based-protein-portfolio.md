<p>Calbee, Inc. has acquired a majority stake in Hodo, Inc., a leading producer of organic tofu and sustainable plant proteins based in Oakland, California. The acquisition, which includes minority investment from Japanese tofu manufacturer Sagamiya Foods Co., Ltd., represents a significant strategic move to accelerate Calbee's international expansion and strengthen its Health and Food business segment.</p><p>The transaction aligns with Calbee's "Change 2025" transformation plan, focusing specifically on U.S. market expansion as demand for sustainable foods continues to grow. According to Makoto Ehara, CEO of Calbee, "As demand for sustainable foods grows, tofu is increasingly valued by health-conscious consumers. With its high plant-based protein content and minimal processing, tofu is drawing particular attention in the U.S. market, where health and environmental concerns are driving growth."</p><p>Hodo has established itself as an innovative force in the plant-based food sector, producing high-quality tofu and plant-powered proteins made with organic, non-GMO soybeans. The company's products are protein-rich, packed with nutrients, and gluten-free, earning widespread recognition among health-conscious consumers and Michelin-honored chefs across the United States. Hodo supplies retail grocery outlets nationwide as well as major food service partners including Chipotle.</p><p>Minh Tsai, Founder of Hodo, emphasized the company's commitment to quality and taste, stating, "Hodo's foods are protein-rich, packed with nutrients and made with high-quality ingredients. We blend tradition and innovation to create foods for consumers who are looking for healthier options but don't want to compromise on taste." The partnership with Sagamiya Foods will provide additional technical support to further strengthen the venture's growth plans and product development capabilities.</p><p>This acquisition marks Calbee's continued commitment to building a global portfolio of foods that are both enjoyable and meaningful, while addressing the growing consumer demand for sustainable, plant-based protein options in the American market. The move signals the increasing importance of plant-based proteins in global food strategies and demonstrates how traditional snack companies are adapting to changing consumer preferences toward healthier, more sustainable food options.</p>
