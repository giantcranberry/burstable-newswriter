<p>Innovative Designs Inc. (OTCQB: IVDN) has exceeded $2 million in revenue for its fiscal 2025 year, marking the first time in company history this financial milestone has been achieved. The company projects its fiscal third quarter revenue will surpass $600,000, representing more than a 100% increase compared to the same period in 2024. This substantial growth extends the company's profitability to four consecutive quarters, with management expecting to file finalized financial reports ahead of September 15th SEC requirements.</p><p>The sustained profitability reflects growing market acceptance of the company's patented vacuum cell insulation technology, particularly as builders seek solutions for new government building codes specifying continuous insulation and exterior R-Value requirements. The technology's adoption comes at a critical time when construction industry professionals face increasing regulatory pressures to improve energy efficiency in building projects nationwide.</p><p>Beyond revenue achievements, Innovative Designs has strengthened its financial position by eliminating all long-term and convertible debt obligations, paying over $85,000 without issuing new shares. This debt resolution, made possible by rising revenue streams and improved accounts receivable collections, has significantly boosted cash reserves. The company maintains a low share structure with approximately 38 million shares outstanding and a 17 million public float.</p><p>CEO Joseph A. Riccelli Jr. attributed the success to increasing recognition of Insultex House WrapÂ® advantages among homebuilders and remodelers. The product's patented evacuated cell technology provides an R-6 moisture barrier membrane that eliminates the need for additional insulation boards required by competitor products.

Additional product certifications are being pursued to expand suitability for a wider range of customers, positioning the company for continued growth as building codes become more stringent nationwide. This expansion strategy indicates the company's readiness to capitalize on the increasing regulatory requirements for energy-efficient building materials across the construction industry.</p>
