<p>Georgia's commercial construction industry generated $80.9 billion in total economic output and supported 549,347 full-time equivalent jobs according to a comprehensive economic impact report commissioned by Associated Builders and Contractors of Georgia. The report, produced by Economic Research Services, Inc. based on 2022 data, demonstrates the sector's commanding role in powering the state's economy through job creation, revenue generation, and support for associated businesses.</p><p>The commercial construction sector directly and indirectly generated $49.2 billion in earnings for Georgia workers, with $17.1 billion in gross payroll that generated $37.4 billion in output when multiplier effects were considered. Non-payroll spending reached $21.8 billion, supporting local suppliers and generating $43.5 billion in output. The industry contributed $2.7 billion in state tax revenues, including $1.47 billion from income taxes and $1.22 billion from sales and use taxes.</p><p>Bill Anderson, president and CEO of ABC of Georgia, emphasized that commercial construction is not just building structuresâ€”it's building Georgia's economy. The full report available <a href="https://www.abcofgeorgia.org/economic-impact" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">here</a> details how the industry's impact reaches far beyond construction itself, with manufacturing, services, trade, and transportation sectors being the largest beneficiaries connected to commercial development activities.</p><p>Several high-profile projects exemplify this economic impact, including Google's new data center in Douglas County, which would be larger than the Mall of Georgia, Savannah Port's $4.5 billion expansion, and The Battery Atlanta's $1.1 billion mixed-use development. Infrastructure projects like the Atlanta Beltline, Stitch and PATH 400 continue to keep construction and engineering teams busy while creating economic opportunity for the region.</p><p>Despite the industry's strength, Anderson noted potential challenges ahead, including uncertainty around tariffs impacting construction material costs and immigration issues affecting workforce availability. Construction segments showing slowdown include multifamily projects and privately funded developments, while data center projects and government projects in higher education, healthcare, and college sports facilities continue to move forward.</p><p>With Georgia's pro-business climate, Sun Belt population growth, and ongoing infrastructure investments, the report underscores commercial construction's pivotal role in shaping the state's economic trajectory. The sector serves as a foundational pillar of growth for communities across Georgia, with supporting and sustaining the industry being key to ensuring long-term economic vitality.
