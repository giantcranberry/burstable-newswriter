<p>Arizona Commercial Real Estate Women (AZCREW) has selected CBRE Executive Vice President Jackie Orcutt as the recipient of its 2025 Woman ICON award, recognizing her 18-year career marked by exceptional leadership and innovation in commercial real estate. The award, established in 2024, honors women who have paved the way for future generations in the industry.</p><p>Orcutt will receive the honor at AZCREW's annual Woman ICON event on September 16, 2025, at the Phoenix Art Museum, where the organization will also announce the inaugural recipient of the Rising ICON Scholarship. Created by AZCREW and 2024 honoree Beth Jo Zeitzer of R.O.I Properties, the $5,000 scholarship supports individuals building or transitioning into commercial real estate brokerage careers, covering expenses for licenses, prep courses, exams, and professional development.</p><p>AZCREW President Lynette Dreitz stated, "An ICON is someone whose leadership, vision and impact leave a lasting mark on their industry and inspire others to rise. Jackie exemplifies this through her trailblazing career, unwavering commitment to excellence and dedication to empowering women in commercial real estate."</p><p>As Executive Vice President in CBRE's Industrial & Logistics group, Orcutt has completed over 82 million square feet of transactions valued at more than $2.1 billion in the past decade, earning her top producer status at CBRE and recognition including AZ Business Magazine's Top 20 Most Influential Women in Arizona. Her extensive involvement with AZCREW includes graduating from the CREW Network Leadership Certificate Program, holding multiple committee chair positions, serving six years on the Board of Directors, and acting as Chapter President in 2017.</p><p>Orcutt reflected on the recognition, saying, "Receiving the Woman ICON recognition is not just a personal honor, but a celebration of what we've accomplished together. It reinforces my belief that when women champion each other, we create lasting change for everyone."</p><p>The 2025 event will feature keynote speaker Amelia Rose Earhart, a former television news anchor and reporter who became the first person to pilot a single-engine aircraft around the world in recreation of her namesake's flight. Earhart's presentation will draw from her experiences leading teams and navigating challenges, themes explored in her book Learn to Love the Turbulence.</p><p>The combination of honoring established leaders like Orcutt while supporting emerging professionals through the new scholarship program demonstrates AZCREW's comprehensive approach to advancing women in commercial real estate, addressing both recognition of achievement and practical support for career development.</p>
