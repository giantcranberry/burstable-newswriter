<p>IBN has expanded its Social Media Solutions through integration with IgnitionX, creating a comprehensive platform that enables companies to both build organic social media presence and amplify that presence through data-driven targeting. The enhanced solution allows corporate social media content to be retargeted programmatically to reach investor audiences beyond organic feeds, transforming standard social posts into precision advertisements.</p><p>The integration means that content distributed through IBN's Social Media Solutions - which manages branded channels, followership growth, and news distribution across Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn and other platforms - can now be converted into targeted ads reaching likely investors on Google, Meta, LinkedIn, TikTok, YouTube, Reddit and additional digital platforms. This synergy addresses the challenge many companies face in cutting through social media noise to reach specific investor segments.</p><p>While IBN's Social Media Solutions handles content creation, brand voice development, editorial calendars, account management and social campaign strategy, the IgnitionX component extends that reach through programmatic optimization of click-through rates, conversions and overall visibility among investor groups aligned with campaign objectives.
