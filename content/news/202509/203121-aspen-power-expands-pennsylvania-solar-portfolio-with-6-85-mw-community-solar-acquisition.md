<p>Aspen Power has completed the acquisition of two community solar projects in Northampton, Pennsylvania, with a combined capacity of 6.85 megawatts direct current. These projects represent the first to close under a portfolio totaling 18 MWdc under contract with Syncarpha Capital, LLC, marking a significant expansion of the company's Pennsylvania renewable energy footprint.</p><p>Industry estimates from the Solar Energy Industries Association indicate these projects will create approximately 130 jobs, providing economic benefits to the local community. The ground-mounted systems are expected to generate nearly 9 million kilowatt-hours of clean energy annually, equivalent to powering over 800 homes with renewable electricity.</p><p>Jorge Vargas, Chief Executive Officer of Aspen Power, emphasized the importance of these developments, stating that solar has become the most affordable source of new electricity in the United States. Despite challenging national political conditions, the company continues to execute projects that create reliable long-term income for landowners while providing affordable clean energy for residents. The partnership with Syncarpha Capital represents a strategic approach to advancing Pennsylvania's clean energy infrastructure.</p><p>Cliff Chapman, co-founder and CEO of Syncarpha Capital, noted that their selection of Aspen Power as a partner was based on the company's strong financial backing and proven execution capabilities. These transactions represent only a fraction of Syncarpha's organically developed Pennsylvania pipeline, indicating potential for further expansion in the state's renewable energy sector.</p><p>Aspen Power has established a substantial presence in Pennsylvania, with more than 100 MW of operating and in-construction assets across the state. The speed of solar deployment makes it a critical solution for meeting growing electricity demand, particularly as Pennsylvania works toward its target of sourcing 18% of electricity from renewables by 2025. These new projects will contribute directly to achieving this goal while supporting grid resilience and sustainability.</p><p>Nationwide, Aspen Power has developed or acquired more than 600 renewable energy projects across 26 states, positioning the company as a leader in the distributed generation sector. The continued expansion in Pennsylvania reflects the growing importance of community solar projects in the transition toward a more affordable, reliable, and sustainable energy future.</p>
