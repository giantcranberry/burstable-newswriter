<p>FTI Consulting reported steady second-quarter financial results, with record performances in restructuring and communications divisions balancing weakness in technology and economic consulting units. The Washington, D.C.-based advisory firm achieved revenue of $944 million, essentially unchanged from the previous year but exceeding Wall Street expectations. While earnings per share declined to $2.13 from $2.34 year-over-year, the results still surpassed analyst forecasts, demonstrating the company's ability to navigate challenging market conditions.</p><p>The Corporate Finance & Restructuring division emerged as the quarter's standout performer, with revenue increasing 9% to a record $379 million. Strategic Communications delivered a surprising 21% jump to $103 million, driven primarily by corporate reputation and crisis management work. Forensic and Litigation Consulting posted solid 10% growth to $187 million, maintaining its consistent performance track record. However, Economic Consulting revenue dropped 17% with margins narrowing to 7%, while the Technology segment experienced a 28% revenue decline due to fewer regulatory-driven discovery assignments.</p><p>FTI maintained its aggressive capital deployment strategy, repurchasing $355 million of stock in the second quarter and $540 million year-to-date. The company utilized debt financing for the buyback program, with total debt rising to approximately $470 million from $160 million in the prior quarter. Despite the increased leverage, the ratio remains modest at about 1.2 times gross debt to EBITDA. CFO Ajay Sabherwal emphasized that leverage represents an outcome rather than a target, reflecting management's opportunistic approach to capital allocation.</p><p>The company announced a significant leadership transition with Sabherwal, who has served as CFO since 2016, departing in September for a role outside consulting. Paul Linton, currently Chief Strategy and Transformation Officer, will serve as interim CFO. Analysts suggest the transition should maintain continuity, though Sabherwal's track record in capital discipline makes the change notable for investors monitoring the firm's financial strategy at <a href="https://www.fticonsulting.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.fticonsulting.com</a>.</p><p>FTI shares currently trade around $163, representing approximately 22 times forward earnings and 14 times EBITDA, showing little movement since July. This valuation suggests investors appreciate the company's stability and cash generation capabilities but remain cautious about prospects for recovery in the weaker business segments. Chief Executive Steven Gunby has characterized 2025 as a challenging year, with the mixed results reflecting the firm's strategy of investing through market cycles despite current challenges in certain consulting areas.</p><p>Management noted that current investments in senior hires and partnerships, while temporarily weighing on margins, are designed to support long-term growth. The divergent performance across business units underscores the consulting industry's cyclical nature and FTI's approach to maintaining strength in core areas while navigating softer demand in others. The company's ability to generate consistent cash flow enables continued shareholder returns through buybacks even during periods of segment-specific weakness, positioning FTI for sustainable growth as market conditions evolve.</p>
