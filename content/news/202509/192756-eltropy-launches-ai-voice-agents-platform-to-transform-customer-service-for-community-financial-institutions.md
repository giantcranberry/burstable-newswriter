<p>Eltropy has launched its next-generation AI Voice Agents platform specifically designed for community financial institutions seeking to modernize their telephone customer service operations. The agentic AI technology transforms traditional phone systems into intelligent, autonomous voice agents capable of understanding natural speech, completing transactions, and escalating complex issues to human representatives when necessary.</p><p>Unlike conventional menu-based phone systems that often frustrate customers with limited options, Eltropy AI Voice Agents enable free-form dialogue that handles routine banking tasks from start to finish. The platform supports account services, payments and transfers, loan services, and card management through human-like conversations in multiple languages, with deep integrations across more than 10 core banking systems. Early adopters have reported significant results, including 88% containment across 11.8 million consumer questions and 60% of agent calls being deflected to free up human resources.</p><p>Ashish Garg, Co-founder and CEO of Eltropy, emphasized the technology's importance for community financial institutions struggling with outdated infrastructure. The platform addresses critical operational challenges by providing 24/7 service capabilities while managing costs and improving efficiency. Key capabilities include conversational AI with natural dialogue, agentic functionality that completes tasks end-to-end, core banking integrations for real-time data access, humanized multilingual voices, contextual escalation with full conversation transfer to live agents, and multi-layer authentication including voice biometrics.</p><p>The system comes with prebuilt workflows supporting over 60% of common community financial institution use cases immediately upon implementation. Saahil Kamath, VP of Product, AI at Eltropy, explained the transformative nature of the technology, noting how the agentic AI authenticates users through natural conversation, processes transfers in real-time, and confirms completion while sounding completely human. The AI Voice Agents integrate directly into Eltropy's Unified Conversations Platform, sharing context across text, chat, email, and video communications for seamless customer experiences.</p><p>Kristen Schmieg, SVP Chief Digital Officer at InTouch Credit Union, noted the platform's performance improvements, stating that the product is already outperforming the previous version thanks to efforts in developing prompts and personality traits that create a more conversational and engaging experience. The launch follows successful beta testing and demonstrates significant improvements in call resolution times, consumer satisfaction, and operational efficiency during pilot programs.
