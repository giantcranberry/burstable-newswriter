<p>The Global Wellness Institute has recognized Rancho Mission Viejo, a 23,000-acre master-planned community in Orange County, California, as one of the world's largest intentional wellness real estate developments. The community was featured among only 13 global projects in the newly released GWI Build Well to Live Well Report: Case Studies, highlighting its measurable health outcomes and comprehensive approach to community wellness design.</p><p>Jeremy Laster, President of Rancho Mission Viejo, stated that the recognition validates the community's foundational vision that design can serve as a catalyst for wellbeing. From initial land planning and stewardship to neighborhood infrastructure and resident programming, the development has prioritized creating access to nature, spaces, and social connections that support wellness across all life stages. This approach aligns with findings from the recent America at Home Study, which identified wellness as the number one purchase motivator driving housing decisions.</p><p>The Global Wellness Institute's case study emphasizes Rancho Mission Viejo as a model for how large-scale residential communities can achieve measurable wellness outcomes. According to a recent resident survey, 82% of respondents reported that living on The Ranch supports their overall wellbeing. Teri Slavik-Tsuyuki, Co-Chair of the GWI Wellness Communities & Real Estate Initiative, noted that the community demonstrates what's possible when wellness is intentionally integrated into every community facet, moving beyond amenities to create opportunities for healthier, more connected living.</p><p>Wellness principles are embedded throughout Rancho Mission Viejo's built environment, including access to preserved open space through The Nature Reserve, walkability features, intergenerational living with Gavil√°n 55+ homes integrated throughout the community, a community farm program, state-of-the-art amenities and sports parks, climate resilience strategies, and wildfire adaptation tactics. The community also maintains a robust calendar of resident programming designed to encourage social connection and active lifestyles.</p><p>Katherine Johnston, Senior Research Fellow at GWI, highlighted that wellness real estate represents the fastest-growing wellness sector in the United States, projected to grow 15.2% annually from 2024 to 2029 and exceed one trillion dollars globally. While many wellness-focused developments remain small boutique projects, Rancho Mission Viejo demonstrates how to implement wellness real estate principles at scale.

The community's success demonstrates that wellness integration can drive both resident satisfaction and business value at scale. With wellness real estate projected to become a trillion-dollar global market, this case study provides a blueprint for developers seeking to capitalize on growing consumer demand for health-focused living environments.</p><p>For technology leaders, the implications extend beyond traditional real estate development. The integration of wellness principles into community design represents an opportunity for smart city technologies, health monitoring systems, and sustainable infrastructure solutions. The measurable outcomes achieved by Rancho Mission Viejo suggest that data-driven approaches to community wellness could become standard practice in future development projects, creating new markets for technology companies specializing in health and wellness applications.</p>
