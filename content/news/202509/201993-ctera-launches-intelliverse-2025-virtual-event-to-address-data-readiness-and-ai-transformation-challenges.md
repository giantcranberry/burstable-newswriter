<p>CTERA has announced IntelliVerse 2025, a free two-day virtual event scheduled for September 16-17, designed to help IT leaders, business executives, and technology professionals manage, protect, store, and leverage data across distributed environments. The forum focuses on data readiness and AI's role in digital transformation, addressing urgent enterprise needs as global data is projected to reach 181 zettabytes in 2025.</p><p>Karyn Price, Industry Director of ICT at Frost & Sullivan, emphasized that maintaining outdated storage infrastructure poses significant risks, making modernization essential for future-proofing and unlocking new data value. Educational forums like IntelliVerse provide industry leaders with strategies to achieve efficiency, resilience, and compliance in an increasingly data-driven business landscape.</p><p>The event is organized into three tracks: General Sessions with keynotes and panels from industry experts, Partner Sessions for CTERA's channel and strategic partners focusing on business growth, and Customer Sessions offering hands-on learning for maximizing data infrastructure investments. Featured speakers include Michael Hay from Hitachi Vantara, Trevor White from Nucleus Research, Alex Acilla from Enterprise Storage Group, Brad Shimmin from The Futurum Group, and Darren Sharpe from Microsoft.</p><p>Brad Shimmin noted that many stalled AI initiatives result from data readiness issues rather than AI challenges, highlighting the importance of building competitive advantages beyond algorithms. This insight underscores the critical need for enterprises to address foundational data infrastructure before pursuing advanced AI implementations.
