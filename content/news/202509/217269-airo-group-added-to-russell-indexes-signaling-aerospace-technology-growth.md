<p>AIRO Group Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: AIRO) has been added to the Russell 2000 and Russell 3000 indexes, a development that significantly expands the company's market visibility and investment appeal. The inclusion became effective at market opening on September 22, 2025, marking an important milestone for the diversified aerospace, advanced avionics, and defense technology company.</p><p>Dr. Chirinjeev Kathuria, Executive Chairman of AIRO, emphasized the strategic importance of this development. AIRO's addition to the Russell 2000 and 3000 Indexes highlights the strength of our strategy and the confidence investors are placing in our company, Kathuria stated. The inclusion reflects the company's growing market capitalization, financial performance, and positive growth trajectory in the competitive aerospace and defense sector.</p><p>The Russell 2000 Index, which represents a subset of the broader Russell 3000 Index, serves as one of the most widely used benchmarks for U.S. small-cap equities. Membership in these indexes typically enhances a company's credibility within the investment community and provides access to a broader base of institutional investors. This development is particularly significant for AIRO as it opens opportunities with index funds and exchange-traded funds that track these benchmarks, potentially supporting increased liquidity and long-term shareholder value.</p><p>AIRO operates as a technologically differentiated platform targeting 21st century aerospace and defense opportunities through four distinct operating segments: Drones, Avionics, Training, and Electric Air Mobility. The company's inclusion in these prominent indexes comes following its recent SEC filings, including the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended June 30, 2025 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on August 13, 2025. This regulatory documentation, available through the <a href="https://www.sec.gov" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">SEC's official website</a>, provides detailed financial information and risk factors relevant to investors.</p><p>The Russell indexes inclusion represents more than just a technical achievement for AIRO. It signals growing recognition of the company's position in key growth areas within the aerospace and defense market. As institutional investors increasingly rely on index-based investment strategies, AIRO's presence in these benchmarks could lead to broader market recognition and potentially more stable long-term investment interest. The company's focus on emerging technologies across its four operating segments aligns with current trends in defense modernization and aerospace innovation.</p><p>For business and technology leaders, AIRO's index inclusion serves as an indicator of the growing institutional validation for companies operating in advanced aerospace technologies. The development suggests that investors are recognizing the long-term potential of sectors including drone technology, electric air mobility, and advanced avionics systems. This increased visibility could potentially attract more sophisticated investors to the aerospace technology space, benefiting the entire industry ecosystem.</p><p>The implications extend beyond immediate financial metrics, as index inclusion often correlates with improved corporate governance standards and enhanced transparency requirements. Companies included in major indexes typically face greater scrutiny from institutional investors and analysts, which can drive operational improvements and strategic discipline. For AIRO specifically, this milestone may accelerate the company's ability to secure strategic partnerships and attract top talent in the competitive aerospace technology sector.</p>
