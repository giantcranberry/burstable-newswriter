<p>PointClickCare has introduced an enhanced ED Optimization solution powered by artificial intelligence that delivers instant, actionable insights from skilled nursing facility stays directly to emergency department care teams. The solution leverages the most extensive post-acute dataset in North America to bridge a long-standing gap in care transitions between skilled nursing facilities and hospitals.</p><p>The AI-informed proprietary Reason for Transfer AI Model provides frontline providers with critical patient information when and where it is needed most. According to Hamad Husainy, DO, FACEP, chief medical officer at PointClickCare, emergency departments often receive too little data, too late, or an overwhelming amount of unfiltered data. This new solution empowers providers with timely, actionable insights that streamline decision-making and elevate patient care.</p><p>Building on the existing SNF Stay Summary which provides a comprehensive snapshot of a patient's experience, this AI innovation advances the scope and depth of patient information. ED teams now instantly receive vital updates detailing the patient's most recent 24 hours in SNF care, offering critical insight into the context behind each transfer. This allows frontline staff to make faster, more informed care decisions that can reduce unnecessary admissions.</p><p>Dr. Gina Sulmeyer, executive director of Medical Informatics at Torrance Memorial Medical Center, noted that getting a real-time summary of the SNF stay has changed how they handle post-acute transfers. Having accurate medication lists, next of kin information, treating physician details, and reason for transfer in a single electronic location enables rapid action and helps safely return patients to the SNF when appropriate.</p><p>This innovation represents a critical step in PointClickCare's mission of helping providers deliver exceptional, patient-centered care. By harnessing powerful AI-driven insights, the company is closing critical gaps across the care continuum and establishing itself as a leader in healthcare intelligence during high-stakes transitions of care. The solution will be demonstrated at the ACEP Scientific Assembly in September 2025.
