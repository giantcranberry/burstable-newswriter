<p>Lee's Famous Recipe Chicken is celebrating National Chicken Month throughout September 2025 with a promotional campaign that simultaneously rewards frequent customers and supports community initiatives. The restaurant chain is offering guests who visit three times during the month $5 off their next order of $15 or more, with the promotion running from September 1 through September 30 at participating locations.</p><p>Customers can redeem up to four offers throughout the month by joining the free Lee's Rewards program, which allows members to earn one point for every dollar spent toward menu items and discounts. The program is accessible through the Lee's app, available for download at <a href="https://play.google.com/store" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://play.google.com/store</a> or <a href="https://www.apple.com/app-store/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.apple.com/app-store/</a>.</p><p>Ryan Weaver, CEO of Lee's Famous Recipe Chicken, emphasized the company's appreciation for loyal customers, noting that the promotion encourages multiple visits while maintaining the restaurant's seven-day weekly operation. The campaign includes specially designed meal options, including the Spicy Wing Combo for individual diners and the Split Decision Meal for families or larger groups, both featuring the brand's classic sides that have remained popular for decades.</p><p>Beyond customer rewards, Lee's continues its partnership with GiftAMeal, a cause-marketing program that converts customer photos into meals for local families in need. Guests can scan the program QR code at any Lee's location or use the brand's app to upload photos of their dining experience, triggering restaurant-funded donations to local food banks. Additional information about the program is available at <a href="https://www.giftameal.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.giftameal.com</a>.</p><p>The integration of customer loyalty programs with charitable initiatives represents a growing trend in the restaurant industry, demonstrating how businesses can balance commercial objectives with social responsibility. For business leaders and technology professionals, this approach highlights the potential for loyalty programs to serve dual purposesâ€”driving customer retention while supporting community welfare. The use of digital platforms for both rewards and charitable contributions also illustrates how technology can facilitate seamless integration of commercial and social objectives.</p><p>The promotion's structure, which requires multiple visits to qualify for discounts, creates sustained customer engagement throughout the month rather than one-time transactions. This approach provides valuable data on customer behavior and preferences while building long-term relationships. The combination of traditional restaurant operations with digital loyalty tracking and charitable photo submissions demonstrates how established businesses can adapt to modern consumer expectations while maintaining their core values and community connections.</p>
