<p>CohnReznick, the century-old accounting and tax consulting firm, is advising businesses to take a measured approach to artificial intelligence implementation rather than adopting it indiscriminately. According to Sabrina Quinn, national sales director at CohnReznick, companies should first identify specific business challenges before determining if AI represents the appropriate solution. This strategic methodology aims to help organizations make better decisions while navigating the rapidly evolving technological landscape of what's being called the Fourth Industrial Revolution.</p><p>Quinn emphasized that businesses rushing to implement AI without proper strategy could face vulnerabilities including evolving cyber threats, regulatory changes, and compliance issues. Instead of viewing AI as a standalone solution, CohnReznick recommends starting with applications companies already use daily. Most modern software, whether customer relationship management platforms or project management tools, contain built-in AI functionality that can enhance productivity without requiring massive technological overhauls. This gradual integration allows businesses to benefit from AI's capabilities while minimizing disruption.</p><p>CohnReznick practices this philosophy internally through what Quinn describes as a use case hackathon within their sales and marketing teams. Employees identify day-to-day operational challenges and explore how AI can address them specifically. This approach has proven effective even with veteran sales professionals accustomed to traditional methods, as they witness firsthand how AI can improve efficiency and customer interactions. The company also leverages AI to coordinate activities across different time zones and regions, ensuring optimal preparation for client meetings despite resource constraints.</p><p>One practical application of CohnReznick's AI strategy is the <a href="https://www.cohnreznick.com/therqtrim" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">RQ Trim tool</a>, an AI-powered solution designed to help manufacturing, distribution, life sciences, private equity, and financial companies manage risks related to tariffs, inflation, and supply chain volatility. Clients complete a approximately twelve-minute survey with financial inputs, and the AI model generates actionable strategies and executive-ready insights. This tool exemplifies how targeted AI implementation can transform business stagnation into acceleration by providing clear guidance through complex economic challenges.</p><p>The company's approach underscores that AI should function as an embedded tool rather than a disruptive force. Quinn compares effective AI integration to having an administrative assistant through tools like Copilot or leveraging existing functionality within familiar platforms. By focusing on specific use cases and measurable improvements, businesses can harness AI's potential while maintaining operational stability and managing associated risks effectively.</p><p>For business leaders navigating the AI landscape, CohnReznick's methodology offers a practical framework that prioritizes strategic alignment over technological novelty. The firm's emphasis on identifying genuine business needs before implementing AI solutions provides a safeguard against the common pitfall of adopting technology for technology's sake. This approach becomes particularly relevant as regulatory frameworks around AI continue to evolve, with companies needing to balance innovation with compliance requirements.</p><p>The implications of this strategic approach extend beyond immediate operational improvements. Companies that successfully integrate AI through measured implementation may gain competitive advantages in talent retention, as employees work with tools that genuinely enhance their capabilities rather than disrupt established workflows. Furthermore, this methodology supports sustainable growth by ensuring AI investments deliver tangible returns rather than becoming costly experiments that fail to address core business challenges.</p>
