<p>XTI Aerospace, Inc. has priced a $20 million public offering of common stock and warrants, with proceeds designated for advancing development of its innovative TriFan 600 aircraft. The company announced the pricing of a best-efforts public offering of 12,500,000 shares of common stock and warrants to purchase up to 12,500,000 shares at a combined price of $1.60 per share and associated warrant.</p><p>The warrants feature an exercise price of $2.00 per share, are immediately exercisable, and will expire five years after issuance. Gross proceeds from the offering are expected to total $20 million before deducting placement agent fees and other offering expenses. The closing of the offering is anticipated to occur on September 15, 2025, with ThinkEquity acting as sole placement agent for the transaction.</p><p>Net proceeds from the offering will be used for working capital, general corporate purposes, and specifically for the development of the TriFan 600 airplane. This funding represents a critical step in bringing the revolutionary aircraft closer to production. The TriFan 600 represents an entirely new category of aircraft—the xVTOL—combining vertical takeoff and landing capabilities with the speed and range of traditional fixed-wing aircraft.</p><p>Designed to have the vertical takeoff and landing capability of a helicopter, the TriFan 600 promises maximum cruising speeds of over 300 mph and a range up to 1,000 miles. This combination of features addresses significant limitations in current aviation options, potentially transforming business travel and regional transportation.

This division serves customers worldwide who use the company's location intelligence solutions in industrial facilities to optimize operations, increase productivity, and enhance safety. The public offering's successful completion will provide essential capital to advance both the TriFan 600 program and the company's broader technological initiatives in the aerospace and industrial technology sectors.</p>
