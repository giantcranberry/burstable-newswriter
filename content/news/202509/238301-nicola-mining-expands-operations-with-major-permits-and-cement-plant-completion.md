<p>Nicola Mining Inc. and partner Lower Nicola Site Services Ltd. have announced substantial operational expansion through newly secured permits and the completion of a cement ready mix plant. The company obtained two critical permits that will dramatically increase its operational capacity and extend mine life, representing a strategic advancement in its business operations.</p><p>The first permit, a Notice of Departure at the New Craigmont Project, authorizes extraction of up to 3.0 million tonnes of inert rock material at approximately 1,500 tonnes per day. This expansion significantly enhances the company's mining capabilities and establishes a clear pathway for increased production volumes. The second permit, received September 5, 2025, extends the gravel pit mine life alongside a provincial highway, ensuring continued operations and maintaining crucial transportation access for material movement.</p><p>The completion of the cement ready mix plant marks a strategic diversification of Nicola Mining's operations beyond traditional mining activities. This new facility enables the company to process materials on-site and create value-added products for construction and infrastructure markets. The expansion aligns with the company's broader strategy to maximize the potential of its mineral properties while developing complementary business lines that can generate additional revenue streams.</p><p>Nicola Mining maintains a 100% owned mill and tailings facility near Merritt, British Columbia, and has signed Mining and Milling Profit Share Agreements with high grade gold projects. The company's fully permitted mill can process both gold and silver mill feed via gravity and flotation processes. Additional information about the company's operations is available at <a href="https://ibn.fm/HUSIF" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://ibn.fm/HUSIF</a>.</p><p>The company's portfolio includes 100% ownership of the New Craigmont Project, a high-grade copper property covering 10,913 hectares along the southern end of the Guichon Batholith. This strategic location adjacent to Highland Valley Copper, Canada's largest copper mine, provides significant geological advantages and substantial potential for resource development. The company also owns 100% of the Treasure Mountain Property, which includes 30 mineral claims and a mineral lease spanning over 2,200 hectares.</p><p>These developments represent critical milestones for Nicola Mining as it simultaneously expands traditional mining operations and diversifies into construction materials production. The combination of expanded extraction capacity and new processing capabilities positions the company for sustained growth in British Columbia's resource sector. For business leaders and investors, this expansion demonstrates how mining companies can leverage existing assets to create diversified revenue streams while maintaining core mining operations. The cement plant diversification provides a hedge against commodity price volatility while serving growing infrastructure demands in British Columbia's construction sector.</p>
