<p>The Hispanic Public Relations Association (HPRA) has announced the complete list of finalists for the 2025 HPRA ¡BRAVO! Awards, recognizing outstanding achievements in multicultural communications. Winners will be revealed at the awards gala on November 13, 2025, at The Drake Hotel in Chicago, with this year's program introducing HPRA's inaugural leadership summit focused on cultural and industry trends.</p><p>HPRA President Sonia V. Diaz emphasized the significance of this work, stating that Latino storytelling remains essential to both the economy and the nation's future. She noted that Latinos currently represent the largest contributors to consumer spending, entrepreneurship, and the labor force, making the recognition of creative work reflecting their power and impact particularly timely.</p><p>This year's competition attracted over 40 submissions from agencies, brands, and nonprofit organizations across the country. Finalists include 21 campaigns spanning 12 categories, such as Digital or Media Platform PR Program, Film, Music & Entertainment, Influencer Engagement, and Integrated Marketing Communications Campaigns. Other categories include Internal Communications Programs, Lifestyle, Multicultural PR Program, New Product/Service Launch, Non-Profit Campaigns, Social Equity, Sports, and Agency of the Year.</p><p>Notable campaign finalists include McDonald's collaboration with BODEN Agency titled "Uniting Abuela and Gen Z Through the Grandma McFlurry," Neutrogena's "Ultimate Flag Football Mini Camp" partnership with CCOMGROUP INC., and Chemistry Cultura's work with LiS: Latinos in Sports™ focused on connecting leagues, teams and brands with the powerful Hispanic fanbase. The FIFA World Cup 2026 Miami Host Committee's poster reveal campaign also received recognition among the finalists.</p><p>The selection process involved campaigns conducted between January 1, 2024, and March 31, 2025, with finalists chosen from submissions ranking in the top 75th percentile of their categories. Each submission underwent evaluation by three judges using a 1-5 scale across twelve evaluation pillars, including goals and objectives, strategy, resources, budget efficiency, originality/creativity, and outcomes. Agency of the Year finalists faced additional scrutiny regarding business growth, employee/client retention, talent development, and industry-wide engagement.</p><p>The judging panel represented diverse expertise from brand, agency, media, industry, and academia backgrounds, ensuring that finalists were evaluated according to criteria of innovation, impact, and overall excellence. The methodology reflects HPRA's commitment to recognizing work that demonstrates cultural fluency and moves the communications industry forward while highlighting the growing influence of Latino storytelling in mainstream media and marketing.</p>
