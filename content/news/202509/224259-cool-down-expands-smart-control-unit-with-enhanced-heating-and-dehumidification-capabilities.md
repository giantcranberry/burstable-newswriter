<p>Cool Down has released an upgraded version of its Smart Control Unit, expanding the thermal transfer system's functionality with enhanced heating and dehumidification capabilities. The new features are designed to help homeowners reduce energy costs and improve comfort throughout the year by leveraging consistent basement temperatures. The system, known for reducing air conditioning use by up to 67% per season, now offers greater flexibility for various home configurations and climate conditions.</p><p>The upgraded unit introduces Basic Heating Mode, which captures and circulates heat from areas with wood stoves, pellet stoves, mini-splits, or south-facing windows during winter months. This expansion beyond cooling functionality makes the system a year-round solution for energy management. The new Dehumidification Mode enables air conditioning systems or heat pumps to dehumidify unfinished basement spaces, cutting cooling costs while improving indoor air quality throughout the home.</p><p>According to founder Damien Semel-DeFeo, the Smart Control Unit puts more control and savings in the hands of homeowners. The new modes allow the system to be customized for any home, climate, or energy-use goal, providing flexibility previously unavailable in residential thermal transfer systems. This advancement comes at a critical time as electricity rates continue rising nationwide, making energy efficiency increasingly important for household budgets.</p><p>The system now includes an Estimated Savings Display that shows real-time energy savings, helping homeowners track return on investment and optimize system usage. Power Boost Mode temporarily prioritizes cooling and dehumidification performance over energy savings during extremely hot or humid conditions, while Eco Boost Mode maximizes energy savings by preventing AC or heat pump activation during shoulder seasons or for homes with moderate cooling needs.</p><p>For homes without existing ductwork, the system now functions as a central cooling solution through Standalone Mode. While slightly less powerful than traditional air conditioning, this mode offers dramatically lower operating costs. The Cool Down system serves as a practical, low-cost alternative or supplement to traditional cooling systems, particularly relevant as energy efficiency becomes more critical for both economic and environmental reasons.</p><p>The system integrates seamlessly with or without existing HVAC equipment and requires no refrigerants, compressors, or external condensers. Professional installation typically takes just a few hours.

The expansion of thermal transfer technology represents a significant step forward in residential energy management, offering homeowners new ways to combat rising energy costs while maintaining comfort.</p>
