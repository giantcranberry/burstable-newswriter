<p>The Sovereign AI Access Company has established a Decentralized AI Steering Committee with founding members 0G Labs and Manifest Network, representing critical components of the decentralized AI technology stack. This collaboration addresses the growing need for structured development beyond centralized platforms in the rapidly expanding blockchain-based AI industry.</p><p>Manifest Network will represent the DeAI Compute sector while 0G Labs, the parent company of the <a href="https://the0g.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">the0G blockchain</a>, will represent DeAI Training. The committee's primary objective is to standardize and commercially deploy decentralized AI platforms, applications, and agents through collaborative industry leadership. According to Sovereign AI Access Company CEO John Sarson, this vertical alignment between 0G as a decentralized Layer1 and Manifest Network as a decentralized Layer0 will benefit both projects and the broader industry.</p><p>The committee brings together recognized leaders in decentralized AI who are bringing next-generation blockchain solutions to market. 0G's AI-optimized blockchain operating system enables unprecedented large-scale AI model training directly on-chain, introducing essential speed, scalability, and process controls that establish new guardrails for the AI sector. Meanwhile, Manifest Network's distributed, enterprise-grade AI server network provides permissionless compute with the security and performance of private AI infrastructure combined with the ease-of-use and scalability of traditional cloud services.</p><p>Eric Bravick of Manifest Network emphasized that this initiative focuses on creating durable infrastructure and interoperability standards that will allow DeAI to grow outside the boundaries of big tech and centralized clouds. The system being designed aims to benefit developers, operators, and institutional partners alike through standardized approaches to decentralized AI development.</p><p>As a Layer1 provider, 0G Labs has pioneered the first high-speed, low-latency blockchain specifically optimized for AI workloads, with a token-driven ecosystem supporting applications, agents, and trusted execution environments. The steering committee will steward capital allocations, set technology standards, and drive ecosystem adoption across the decentralized AI landscape.</p><p>Committee members share a vision that fair and open access to AI and compute will be fundamental to protecting personal liberty in an increasingly AI-driven world. According to DeAI Steering Committee member W. Reed Baum, effective decentralized, permissionless networks represent humanity's best chance to preserve individual access to private AI solutions, particularly when training AI models can cost hundreds of millions of dollars, creating barriers that decentralized approaches can help overcome.</p><p>The Sovereign AI Access Company serves as an implementation and commercialization team for projects in its treasury, enabling infrastructure deployment at scale, strategic investment, and broad investor participation in the DeAI economy. The carefully curated steering committee provides strategic direction for the broader DeAI community with the ability to directly assist and incentivize projects to adopt technical standards set by the committee, thereby improving vertical alignment across the industry.</p>
