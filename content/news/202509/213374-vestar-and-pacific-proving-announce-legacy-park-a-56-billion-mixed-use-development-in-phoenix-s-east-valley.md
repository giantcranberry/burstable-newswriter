<p>Vestar, in partnership with Pacific Proving, LLC, has announced Legacy Park, a transformative mixed-use development that will become the largest such project in Phoenix's East Valley. The development represents a generational investment that will redefine urban living in the region while delivering substantial economic benefits to the City of Mesa.</p><p>Strategically located at the convergence of Mesa, Gilbert, and Queen Creek, Legacy Park will feature 300,000 square feet of upscale retail and chef-driven restaurants, many debuting in the East Valley for the first time. The retail component will be comparable in size and design to Scottsdale Quarter, where Vestar serves as a strategic partner. The development will also include 2,500 contemporary multifamily residences and 3.4 million square feet of mid-rise office and corporate campus space.</p><p>The hospitality experience will be curated by The Athens Group, the renowned developer behind properties for Four Seasons, Montage, and Marriott, including Ritz-Carlton resorts. The partnership will deliver a 600-room resort hotel that will offer lodging and event venues on par with top global destinations. David Larcher, President and CEO of Vestar, stated that the resort will provide a new local option for weddings, milestone events, and weekend escapes for both visitors and local residents.</p><p>Central to the development's design is an over 20-acre lush urban park featuring a large lake that will serve as a regional gathering space for recreation, events, and community connection. Andrew Cohn, Principal of Pacific Proving, emphasized that Legacy Park represents decades of belief in the potential of the area, describing it as a thoughtfully designed community that will bring lasting value and lifestyle to the East Valley.</p><p>Located adjacent to Mesa Gateway Airport and easily accessible via the new State Route 24 at Williams Field Road, the project is projected to generate approximately $56 billion in economic output over the next 20 years. The development will create more than 20,000 jobs and contribute significant tax revenues that will support City of Mesa services, including police, fire, parks, airport, and other vital quality-of-life infrastructure. Additional information about the project will be available at <a href="https://legacypark.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://legacypark.com</a> as development progresses.</p><p>Legacy Park is expected to break ground in 2027, marking the beginning of a project that will set new benchmarks for retail, hospitality, and mixed-use living in Arizona while creating an urban oasis that seamlessly blends urban sophistication with natural beauty and sustainable design.</p>
