<p>MWG Holdings Group, Inc. has completed a comprehensive two-year remodel of all retail locations, implementing an open shop model designed to transform cannabis shopping from restrictive to customer-friendly. The redesign creates a more welcoming, guest-friendly in-store experience, with recent updates at Marysville Perfect Union and Wild Seed Wellness marking a major milestone in the company's commitment to delivering a modernized, community-rooted retail experience.</p><p>The open shop model focuses on removing barriers between guests and products, allowing customers to browse an array of products and enjoy a quicker, streamlined check-out experience. Team members are available to answer questions and guide guests, making the experience relaxed and personal. This approach has contributed to MWG's data-driven, growth-focused marketing strategy that has fueled a 30% year-over-year increase in summer revenue.</p><p>To celebrate the remodel completion, MWG launched statewide summer marketing campaigns including limited-edition Perfect Union hat pins featuring city names and local landmarks. The company also introduced the 3 Buck Buzz Bag, an in-store exclusive mystery product with contents ranging in value between $10 and $50. These offerings reflect MWG's customer-centric localized promotions that continue to strengthen brand loyalty while attracting new customers across California.</p><p>As part of its broader summer campaign, MWG expanded distribution of its in-house print publication, smish., which will now be stocked at more than 300 dispensaries across California. The most recent edition features David Polley, founder of Preferred Gardens, on the cover and an in-depth interview with Anna Willey, founder of CAM. The publication serves as a tribute to growers and cultivators who define California's reputation for high-quality cannabis.</p><p>Supporting these in-store efforts, MWG's recently launched <a href="https://www.perfectunion.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Perfect Union website</a> offers a smooth, streamlined online shopping experience with location-specific promotions, enhanced mobile usability, and convenient ordering for pickup and delivery. The company's retail stores have experienced a 32.2% year-over-year increase in transaction count and a 26.7% increase in revenue during the first half of 2025, solidifying MWG's position as an industry leader in cannabis retail innovation.</p>
