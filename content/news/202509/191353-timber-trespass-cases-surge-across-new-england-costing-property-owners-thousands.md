<p>Property owners throughout New England are confronting substantial financial repercussions from timber trespass violations, with attorney Israel Piedra of <a href="https://www.wwflaw.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Welts, White, & Fontaine, P.C.</a> reporting approximately two dozen active tree law cases across New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Maine, and Vermont. The legal specialist recently appeared on NPR's Morning Edition to discuss a high-profile Nantucket case where a neighbor faces criminal charges after cutting down trees to improve his property's view, potentially costing the property owner dearly despite the property being listed at nearly $10 million.</p><p>According to Piedra, timber trespass cases are fairly common in New England, though most instances result from confusion over property lines rather than malicious intent. Many violations occur when neighbors fail to conduct proper property surveys before removing trees, with some cases involving individuals who suspect trees might be on neighboring property but proceed regardless. The Nantucket incident reached what Piedra described as a level of egregiousness comparable to a recent Maine case where trees were poisoned rather than simply cut down.</p><p>While criminal charges remain rare in timber trespass matters, victims typically seek recourse through civil lawsuits focusing on compensation recovery for property damage. These cases often involve thousands of dollars in damages, heightened emotional tensions between neighbors, and complex property law issues that require specialized legal expertise. The firm Welts, White, & Fontaine, P.C. specializes in helping property owners navigate these complex premises liability and real estate law matters throughout southern New Hampshire and surrounding states.</p><p>Tree law represents a little-known subsector of civil law that continues to gain attention as property values increase and boundary disputes become more financially significant. Property owners are encouraged to verify boundary lines through professional surveys before undertaking any tree removal projects to avoid potentially costly legal consequences and neighbor disputes that can escalate into lengthy court proceedings.</p>
