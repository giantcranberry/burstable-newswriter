<p>Pathwork, an autonomous distribution platform modernizing the $160 billion life and health insurance market, has raised a $3.5 million seed round led by <a href="https://costanoavc.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Costanoa</a>, with participation from Logos Fund, American Family Ventures, Meridian Ventures, and prominent industry angels. The funding will help accelerate adoption among brokers and carriers nationwide, addressing a market where life and health premiums exceed $1.1 trillion annually in the U.S. alone.</p><p>Life and health insurance touches millions of Americans, but the way policies are sold hasn't meaningfully changed in decades. Distribution remains fragmented, manual, and error-prone, leaving brokers bogged down by outdated software systems and left to chase paperwork and decipher underwriting rules. Pathwork turns these complex, manual workflows into intelligent systems that help brokers and carriers move faster, quote more accurately, reduce costly back-and-forth, and deliver a better customer experience.</p><p>Pathwork combines predictive and generative AI to create a seamless experience for brokers placing policies to carriers making the call. Its product suite includes Case Underwriter, which automates the underwriting process by analyzing unstructured data and surfacing the best-fit carrier options; Knowledge Assistant, which acts as an on-demand expert trained on insurance-specific data; and Pre-App Manager, which helps insurance carriers evaluate incoming cases more efficiently.</p><p>Since launching in 2024, Pathwork has analyzed over 10,000 cases and helped retain millions in commission payments. The company supports more than 50 brokerages and carriers, including Highland Capital Brokerage, National Guardian Life, AIMCOR, Hilb, LifeQuotes, NFP, and Merit Insurance. Adnan Raja, SVP of Digital Transformation at Highland Capital Brokerage, stated: "Highland chose Pathwork for their deep understanding of our challenges and the usability of their products. They're running the most modern tech stack we've seen in this space while meeting the security and compliance demands of our regulated industry."</p><p>The investment signals growing confidence in AI's potential to transform traditionally conservative industries like insurance. Pathwork's approach addresses critical pain points in a sector that has lagged in digital transformation, potentially setting new standards for efficiency and customer experience in insurance distribution. The platform's ability to handle complex underwriting processes and provide real-time expertise could significantly reduce operational costs and improve policy placement success rates across the industry.</p>
