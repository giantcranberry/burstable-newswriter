<p>ITS Logistics announced a major expansion of its DropFleet trailer network, adding thousands of trailers to support rapidly evolving supply chains among its customer base. The expansion addresses growing demand for hybrid capacity solutions that combine the certainty of dedicated equipment with the reach of an extensive carrier network. DropFleet enables shippers to handle dynamic, time-sensitive demand through streamlined trailer pools and yard management, an approach that has proven effective in industries including e-commerce, automotive, and government services.</p><p>Josh Allen, Chief Commercial Officer at ITS Logistics, noted that peak season demands have changed significantly. Shippers require the ability to deliver reliably despite unexpected shifts in demand. The scalability of hybrid capacity solutions offers a balance of guaranteed capacity, cost effectiveness, and geographic flexibility that traditional trailer pools cannot match. Unlike conventional systems, DropFleet trailers have no region or lane limitations, whether they are ITS-owned or carrier-owned assets.</p><p>The company's proprietary, AI-enabled asset management capabilities have been crucial in creating this seamless solution, eliminating challenges associated with pool rebalancing, idle capacity, and yard management for shippers. Allen emphasized that extreme flexibility and scalability are key differentiators, allowing customers to ship varying volumes to different locations with minimal notice. This capability has proven valuable for Fortune 500 shippers including Gap, which recently named ITS Logistics its Peak Carrier of the Year.</p><p>DropFleet currently supports a top ten automotive manufacturer, maintaining a pool of 200 trailers allocated across 16 facilities nationwide and more than 70 daily lanes. Additionally, a top North American retailer leverages 1,000 DropFleet trailers to support massive growth in their emerging e-commerce network. The expansion comes at a critical time when supply chain security concerns are escalating. According to <a href="https://CargoNetdata" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">CargoNetdata</a>, 884 supply chain theft events were recorded across the U.S. and Canada during the second quarter of 2025, representing a 13% increase compared to the same period in 2024.</p><p>To combat rising fraud risks, DropFleet employs stringent prevention practices including multifactor carrier verification during onboarding, which must be recompleted if carriers are dormant for more than thirty days. All carriers use ITS's real-time tracking software, and ITS assets feature GPS tracking and door sensors for additional visibility and security. These aggressive mitigation measures have resulted in ITS Logistics' critical incident rate sitting well below industry standards at 0.004%.</p><p>Allen emphasized that quality surpasses quantity in capacity management, noting that 80% of the company's freight runs on 30% of its carrier network. This selective approach allows ITS to position itself as a strategic partner for carriers seeking reliable opportunities, resulting in a curated pool of proven, dedicated carriers. The expansion reflects broader industry trends toward flexible, secure supply chain solutions that can adapt to rapidly changing market conditions while maintaining high security standards.</p>
