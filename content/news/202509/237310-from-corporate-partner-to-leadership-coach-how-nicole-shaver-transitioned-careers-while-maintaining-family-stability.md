<p>Nicole Shaver spent over two decades at a large Chicago consulting firm, growing from senior accountant to partner during a period of significant expansion that saw the company grow from approximately 100 people to more than 2,000 employees. Despite her technical background as a CPA and accountant, Shaver discovered that her true passion lay in developing people rather than crunching numbers. When ownership changes at her firm created an opportunity for career reflection, she decided to pursue leadership coaching full-time.</p><p>The transition from corporate finance to coaching represented a significant professional shift, but Shaver found her background provided unexpected preparation. Growing up with parents who owned their own business gave her realistic expectations about entrepreneurship, while her corporate experience developing financial and strategic planning alongside C-level leaders provided valuable insight into organizational dynamics. What makes my approach unique is that I combine strong analytical skills with people-focused abilities, Shaver explained, noting that her extroverted nature and natural inclination toward helping others served her well in both fields.</p><p>Shaver credits working with a coach herself as pivotal in making the career change. Initially resistant to leaving her corporate role, she struggled with identity questions about who she would be without her established company position. Through coaching sessions, she created space to step back and reflect on what could be possible, realizing that supporting people and helping them reach their goals brought her genuine joy and fulfillment. She obtained International Coaching Federation certification to formalize the coaching and mentoring she had been doing informally throughout her career.</p><p>The practical aspects of transitioning from corporate employment proved challenging, particularly as the primary earner for her family with nine-year-old twins. Healthcare coverage represented a major concern, with Shaver initially relying on COBRA before transitioning to marketplace insurance. Her former employer had a partnership with the post-employment platform <a href="https://www.when.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">When</a>, which provided crucial support during this process. Working with When was incredibly helpful, Shaver noted. I had a wonderful woman who was really consistent in following up with me, got on the phone multiple times to help me understand the logistics and details.</p><p>The insurance transition involved moving from approximately $1,800 monthly COBRA payments to about $2,200 for an Aetna plan, but allowed Shaver to maintain continuity with her therapist, her children's pediatrician, and specialists at Northwestern. Having that human support for something so critical to my family's wellbeing was huge, she emphasized. Her husband's role as house and life manager since their twins were born created the partnership necessary to make the career change feasible for their family.</p><p>Now established in her coaching practice, Shaver focuses on helping leaders and teams reach their full potential. I love creating space for people to reflect and grow, she said. There's so much time in our adult lives where we think we know what we want to do, but being able to shift and embrace new possibilities is a huge blessing. She finds particular fulfillment in working with individuals navigating career transitions and helping teams transform their dynamics, describing the work as feeling like her true calling.</p><p>For others considering similar career changes, Shaver advises not underestimating the power of reflection and working with someone who can help you see possibilities you might not see yourself. She emphasizes the importance of understanding authentic values and what truly drives individuals, while also ensuring practical foundations like finances, healthcare, and family considerations are properly addressed. Having the right support systems makes all the difference in successfully reimagining your possibilities, she concluded, highlighting that both personal reflection and practical planning contribute to successful career transitions.</p>
