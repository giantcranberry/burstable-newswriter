<p>Blo Blow Dry Bar, North America's original blow dry bar franchise, will open its newest location on September 12, 2025, at 4511 Olde Perimeter Way in Dunwoody. The expansion represents a significant development in the beauty and wellness sector, particularly for business leaders tracking franchise growth and community-focused business models.</p><p>Local entrepreneur Jasmine Budhwani, an Atlanta native with an extensive background in banking and business ownership including gas stations, grocery stores, and hotels, owns and operates the new establishment. Her transition into the beauty industry began after experiencing Blo Blow Dry Bar during a visit to Houston for her brother's wedding, recognizing the potential to bring the concept to her community.</p><p>The Dunwoody location will offer comprehensive beauty services including five signature hair styles, a la carte options, various hair treatments, and five signature makeup looks, plus a brand-new section of customized styles. For a limited time, the bar will offer a founder's rate for its Mane Squeeze Membership, which includes two blowouts monthly for $80, $5 off additional blowouts, and 10% off retail products.</p><p>From a business perspective, the expansion creates 10-15 new local jobs and represents the first of three Blo locations Budhwani plans to open across Georgia. This multi-location strategy demonstrates the scalability of the franchise model and the growing demand for specialized beauty services in suburban markets.</p><p>Budhwani's vision extends beyond traditional beauty services, with active plans to partner with female-focused charities, women's support organizations, and community initiatives. The entrepreneur, who is a new mother herself, emphasizes creating spaces where hardworking women can prioritize self-care, aligning with broader trends in workplace wellness and mental health awareness.</p><p>The bar's mission reflects the evolving beauty industry's shift toward inclusivity and wellness, welcoming people of all ages, ethnicities, and orientations while emphasizing self-care. This approach positions the business to capture growing consumer demand for experiences that combine beauty services with emotional well-being.</p><p>To celebrate the opening, guests can purchase single blowouts for $45 from September 12 to October 12, with additional promotions including VIP complimentary services for upgrades. The bar will operate Monday through Friday from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m., Saturday from 9 a.m. to 7 p.m., and Sunday from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. For more information, visit <a href="https://blomedry.com/blo-dunwoody/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://blomedry.com/blo-dunwoody/</a>.</p>
