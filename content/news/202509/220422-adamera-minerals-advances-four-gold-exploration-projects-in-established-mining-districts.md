<p>Adamera Minerals Corp. has provided a comprehensive update on its portfolio of four gold exploration projects spanning Washington State and British Columbia, highlighting significant progress in developing drill-ready targets in established mining districts. The company's systematic exploration approach over the past 12 years has identified multiple high-potential prospects that could yield substantial gold discoveries.</p><p>The South Hedley Gold property in British Columbia covers 18,714 hectares south of the historic Hedley mining district, which has produced over 2.5 million ounces of gold from skarn-hosted deposits similar to Barrick Gold Corp's Nickel Plate mines. Adamera's work has identified multiple structural corridors containing skarn-related and quartz-carbonate vein occurrences. The company has advanced two key prospects: the Max Prospect, defined by a zone with highly anomalous gold, copper and arsenic in soil and rock samples, and the Glix Prospect, where recent sampling revealed soil samples ranging from 100 to 4,282 ppb gold.</p><p>In Washington State, the Flag Hill and Flag Hill South Gold-Silver Properties are situated in the Republic Gold District, which has produced more than 2.8 million ounces of gold and 15 million ounces of silver according to Washington Department of Natural Resources documentation available at <a href="https://dnr.wa.gov/sites/default/files/2025-04/ger_ic110_iaml_republic_mining_dist.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://dnr.wa.gov/sites/default/files/2025-04/ger_ic110_iaml_republic_mining_dist.pdf</a>. Recent drilling by Adamera intersected epithermal veins with zones containing 3.0 g/t gold and 70 g/t silver over 2-meter intervals, suggesting increasing vein thickness and grades with depth.</p><p>The Empire Creek Property, located on the same structural corridor as historic mines including the K2 mine that was operated by Kinross Gold Corp, represents another drill-ready target. Historic drilling at Empire Creek intercepted 10.5 g/t gold and 183.3 g/t silver over 15.24 meters starting at 54 meters depth. The property's proximity to the Republic graben margin and recent geophysical surveys have developed multiple exploration targets.</p><p>The Buckhorn 2.0 Property surrounds Kinross Gold Corp's past-producing Buckhorn Mine, which developed a structurally controlled skarn/carbonate replacement gold system. Adamera has modeled more than 30 exploration targets based on geological characteristics of the original mine, with only 4 of 40 targets tested to date. The project benefits from existing infrastructure including haul roads, power transmission lines and a nearby processing mill. The Buckhorn Mine's operational history is documented in mining industry reports available at <a href="https://miningrecord.com/kinross-golds-buckhorn-mine-is-now-operational/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://miningrecord.com/kinross-golds-buckhorn-mine-is-now-operational/</a>.</p><p>Mark Kolebaba, President and CEO of Adamera, emphasized that the company's decade-long focus on grassroots exploration has created a balanced portfolio of both grassroots and brownfield discoveries in established mining jurisdictions. The company is currently initiating permitting for drilling at the Max and Glix prospects while planning additional geophysical surveys and sampling programs. The strategic positioning of these projects near historic producing mines and in proven gold districts significantly enhances their discovery potential and reduces exploration risk.</p><p>Adamera's exploration methodology includes advanced techniques such as the detectORE method for rapid gold analysis, combined with traditional fire assay verification. The company's systematic approach to target generation, utilizing both historic data and modern exploration technologies, positions these projects for potential success in discovering new gold resources in regions with established mining infrastructure and geological favorability.</p>
