<p>Ready Capital Corporation reported second quarter 2025 financial results showing strategic moves toward restoring profitability through significant asset sales and portfolio optimization. The multi-strategy real estate finance company generated $173 million in lower-to-middle-market commercial originations and $359 million in small business loan originations during the quarter, maintaining a book value of $10.44 per share.</p><p>The company completed the sale of its Residential Mortgage Banking segment as part of ongoing restructuring efforts and repurchased 8.5 million shares at $4.41 per share, demonstrating management's confidence in the company's valuation. Additionally, Ready Capital issued $50 million in 9.375% Senior Secured Notes due 2028 to strengthen its capital position, providing financial flexibility for future investments.</p><p>Most significantly, the company sold 21 loans with a carrying value of $494 million for $85 million in net proceeds. This transaction represents a crucial component of Ready Capital's strategy to liquidate underperforming assets and reinvest capital into its core multifamily bridge portfolio. The asset sales reflect the company's commitment to improving operational efficiency and financial performance by focusing on higher-performing segments.</p><p>Subsequent to quarter-end, Ready Capital secured ownership of a Portland, Oregon mixed-use property through a deed-in-lieu transaction, further demonstrating its active portfolio management approach. The company's comprehensive approach to real estate finance includes specialization in loans backed by commercial real estate and government-guaranteed lending programs through its SBA Section 7(a) and USDA loan platforms available at https://readycapital.com/.</p><p>The strategic shift away from underperforming assets toward the company's core strengths in commercial real estate lending, particularly in agency multifamily, investor, construction, and bridge loan sectors, demonstrates management's proactive approach to navigating challenging market conditions. This restructuring positions Ready Capital to enhance shareholder value through improved operational efficiency and targeted investment in higher-performing business segments.</p>
