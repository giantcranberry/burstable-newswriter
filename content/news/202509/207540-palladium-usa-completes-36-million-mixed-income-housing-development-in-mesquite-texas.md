<p>Palladium USA has completed the $36 million Palladium Mesquite development, a mixed-income multifamily community in Mesquite, Texas, representing the company's second such project in the city. The 111-unit development combines income-restricted housing options with market-rate units, with 95 homes designated for various area median income levels and 16 units reserved at 140% AMI.</p><p>The project's financing structure demonstrates innovative approaches to affordable housing development, featuring $17.6 million in equity from <a href="https://redstone.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Redstone</a>, a $14 million FHA 221(d)(4) loan arranged by <a href="https://walkerdunlop.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Walker & Dunlop</a>, and additional funding including a $13.1 million equity bridge loan from Bridgewater Bank. Construction commenced following the August 28, 2025 closing date, with BBL Building Company serving as general contractor and HEDK Architects providing the design.</p><p>Tom Huth, President and CEO of Palladium USA, emphasized the project's significance, stating it represents the company's ongoing commitment to providing high-quality, mixed-income housing in Mesquite and the surrounding community. The development consists of two five-story buildings featuring one, two, and three-bedroom floor plans with premium interior finishes including granite countertops, nine-foot ceilings, and hardwood-style flooring.</p><p>Mayor Daniel Alem√°n Jr. highlighted the project's alignment with city priorities, noting that workforce housing has been a high priority for the City Council in providing varied housing choices for Mesquite's growing community. The 4.74-acre property at 940 Military Parkway offers convenient access to major transportation corridors including I-635, U.S. 80, and I-30.</p><p>Community amenities include a resort swimming pool, state-of-the-art fitness center, conference facilities, business center, children's playroom, and athletic court. The clubroom features a mini-kitchen with upgraded appliances and quartz countertops, while outdoor spaces include gazebos with grilling stations and a playground. Preleasing is scheduled for Summer 2026, with initial unit deliveries expected in Fall 2026.</p><p>This development addresses critical housing shortages while maintaining quality standards typically associated with market-rate properties. The mixed-income approach provides sustainable housing solutions that benefit both lower-income residents and the broader community through economic diversity and stability.</p>
