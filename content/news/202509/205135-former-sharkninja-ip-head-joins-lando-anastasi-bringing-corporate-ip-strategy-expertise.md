<p>William B. Lacy, Ph.D., former head of global intellectual property at SharkNinja, has joined boutique IP firm Lando & Anastasi, bringing two decades of corporate experience to private practice. His move highlights the growing importance of business-minded IP strategy for companies operating in highly competitive consumer markets.</p><p>During his tenure at SharkNinja, Lacy managed IP strategy during a period of extraordinary growth where the company expanded by more than 150% and completed IPOs on both the Hong Kong and New York stock exchanges. He implemented strategic initiatives including standardized IP playbooks, refined outside counsel relationships, and optimized IP management tools that enabled the team to scale effectively while maintaining quality. These technological foundations and vendor relationships proved crucial for efficient business decision-making according to Lacy.</p><p>Lacy emphasizes unique IP strategies that can enhance competitive advantage, including 'war-gaming' a company's own IP to assess portfolio strength and identify gaps. He also advocates for innovation days where cross-functional teams critique each other's products, which can lead to new features or product identification. His approach combines business mindset with legal analysis to help companies build efficient IP processes.</p><p>The transition from corporate leadership to private practice has been eye-opening for Lacy, who notes that while he had to overcome some 'rust' in direct USPTO engagement, his in-house experience provides valuable perspective for clients navigating internal guidelines and budgetary pressures. His technical background aligns particularly well with chemical, biotech, and analytical methodology technologies, while his consumer products experience provides cross-industry expertise.</p><p>For companies looking to build or strengthen their IP strategy, Lacy offers several key recommendations: putting the right IP team in place both internally and with outside counsel, implementing communication protocols, coordinating with stakeholders across the organization, and being honest about current IP abilities. He stresses the importance of not overlooking design patents, which are relatively inexpensive and quick to obtain but can provide strong value in overall portfolios.</p><p>Lacy's experience includes managing complex international filing and portfolio management, involvement in numerous litigations including proceedings at the International Trade Commission, and successful utilization of Inter Partes Review as an effective defense mechanism. His strategic approach to IP risk management has consistently preserved market access and protected revenue streams for industry leaders according to his professional background.</p>
