<p>Marco's Pizza has been selected by QSR magazine as one of its "16 Best Franchise Deals for 2025," positioning the pizza chain among the most promising investment opportunities in the quick-service restaurant industry. This annual ranking, published by <a href="https://www.wtwhmedia.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">WTWH Media</a>, has been identifying standout brands since 2011 and serves as a critical resource for entrepreneurs and investors evaluating franchise opportunities.</p><p>Selection for the prestigious list is based on comprehensive criteria including franchise costs, growth potential, operator support, and brand differentiation. Danny Klein, Vice President, Food, Retail, Hospitality Editorial Director at QSR Magazine, emphasized the competitive nature of current franchise opportunities, noting that standout brands combine innovation, support, and financial upside. Marco's inclusion reflects its strong franchisee support system, operational model, commitment to quality, and consistent sales performance documented in its Franchise Disclosure Document.</p><p>The recognition comes at a time of significant growth for Marco's, which operates more than 1,200 locations and maintains ambitious expansion plans. Gerardo Flores, Chief Development Officer of Marco's Pizza, stated that the honor validates the company's franchise model and the dedication of operators nationwide. The brand's focus on scaling includes supporting franchise owners with innovative technology, operational excellence, and growth-forward programs.</p><p>This latest accolade builds on Marco's recent achievement of earning FRANdata's 2025 TopScore FUND Award in the food category, further underscoring the brand's commitment to franchisee growth and improved access to financing. The company's expansion strategy targets multi-unit development in the Midwest, East Coast, and Sun Belt regions, along with growth in non-traditional venues and international markets.</p><p>Financial performance data from Marco's Franchise Disclosure Document reveals compelling numbers for potential investors, with the top 25% of franchised stores achieving $1.3 million in average unit volume during 2024. To facilitate continued growth, Marco's recently introduced a Franchise Development Royalty Incentive Program designed to reduce barriers for qualified multi-unit owners. The program offers early-stage royalty incentives starting at 0%, coupled with comprehensive support in real estate, construction, and operations.</p><p>The brand's existing franchisees demonstrate strong confidence in the system, with 65% of 2024 franchise agreements awarded to current operators expanding their portfolios. QSR magazine's selection process for the Best Franchise Deals involved a nomination period from mid-May to mid-June, with finalists reviewed by the Franchise Council using shared information and FDD data. The program maintains strict criteria, preventing brands from appearing in consecutive years while recognizing rising franchisors and maintaining a Hall of Fame category for multiple-time honorees.</p><p>Industry professionals seeking comprehensive restaurant analysis can access QSR magazine's resources at <a href="https://www.qsrmagazine.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.qsrmagazine.com</a>, while those interested in broader industry coverage can explore WTWH Media's offerings at <a href="https://www.wtwhmedia.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.wtwhmedia.com</a>.</p>
