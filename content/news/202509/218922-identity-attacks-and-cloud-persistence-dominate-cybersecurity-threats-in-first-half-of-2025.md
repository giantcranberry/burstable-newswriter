<p>The cybersecurity landscape has undergone significant transformation during the first half of 2025, with identity-based attacks and exploitation of unaddressed security gaps becoming increasingly prevalent according to Ontinue's latest threat intelligence findings. Adversaries are successfully bypassing multi-factor authentication at alarming rates while exploiting fundamental security weaknesses that many organizations continue to overlook, creating substantial challenges for enterprise security teams.</p><p>Cloud persistence tactics have experienced a dramatic surge, with nearly 40% of Azure intrusions involving adversaries layering multiple persistence methods including application manipulation, automation job exploitation, and role escalation. When attackers successfully suppressed telemetry, median dwell time exceeded 21 days, providing ample opportunity for data exfiltration and system compromise. This extended access period represents a critical vulnerability in modern cloud environments where rapid detection and response are essential for containing breaches.</p><p>Token replay abuse continues to plague organizations, with approximately 20% of live incidents involving adversaries reusing stolen refresh tokens to bypass MFA even after password resets. This sophisticated technique demonstrates how attackers are evolving beyond traditional credential theft methods. Simultaneously, phishing attacks have evolved beyond traditional Office documents, with over 70% of attachments bypassing secure email gateways being non-traditional formats like SVG or IMG files. The resurgence of USB malware with a 27% increase compared to late 2024 reinforces the ongoing risk of removable media in enterprise environments, with a <a href="https://Honeywellstudy" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Honeywell study</a> from 2024 showing 51% of USB-based threats could cause major disruption.</p><p>Third-party risk has doubled year-over-year, with nearly 30% of incidents linked to vendor compromise including supply chain attacks targeting retailers and manufacturers. This escalation highlights the expanding attack surface that organizations must manage as business ecosystems become increasingly interconnected. While ransomware showed a 35% year-over-year drop in reported ransom payments, there were still more than 4,000 claimed ransomware breaches globally in the first half of 2025, led by CL0P, AKIRA, and QILIN groups, indicating that the ransomware threat remains substantial despite improved defensive measures.</p><p>Craig Jones, Chief Security Officer at Ontinue, emphasized that cybercriminals are operating with the speed and adaptability of modern businesses, pivoting, rebranding, and retooling in weeks rather than months. The report outlines practical defensive measures including phishing-resistant MFA, hardened endpoint configurations, and robust vendor risk management. It emphasizes integrating real-world threat intelligence into security testing to ensure defenses match current adversary techniques, particularly in cloud environments where persistence and evasion tactics are rapidly evolving. The full <a href="https://1H2025ThreatIntelligenceReport" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">1H 2025 Threat Intelligence Report</a> provides detailed analysis of ransomware activity, phishing-as-a-service operations, infostealer malware, and advanced persistent threats, serving as a critical resource for security leaders navigating the current threat landscape.</p><p>For business and technology leaders, these findings underscore the urgent need to build resilience into every layer of their environment, from identity controls to incident response capabilities. Maintaining security fundamentals like restricting USB usage and reinforcing user training remains essential, but must be complemented by advanced threat detection and response mechanisms tailored to address the specific tactics highlighted in the report. The evolving nature of these threats demands continuous adaptation and investment in security infrastructure to protect critical business assets and maintain operational continuity in an increasingly hostile digital environment.</p>
