<p>Lang Realty has initiated its annual Breast Cancer Awareness Month campaign, transforming offices and community outreach efforts pink throughout October. The real estate company's multi-faceted approach raises awareness and generates funds for breast cancer programs across South Florida, building on its longstanding commitment to the cause. Company President Scott Agran emphasized the personal connection many team members have with breast cancer, noting that the disease affects colleagues, families, and clients throughout their community.</p><p>The campaign's centerpiece involves participation in two American Cancer Society Making Strides Against Breast Cancer Walks. The Palm Beach team is led by agent Dawn Forgione, while the Treasure Coast team is coordinated by Eydie Lopez. Both team leaders are actively recruiting walkers and encouraging donations throughout the month, with registration and donation information available through their respective team pages at <a href="https://www.cancer.org" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.cancer.org</a>.</p><p>Within Lang Realty offices, the campaign includes comprehensive pink-themed decorations featuring pens, candies, banners, wristbands, and lapel pins. Informational flyers about walk registration and donation opportunities are displayed throughout offices and shared with clients and agents. The company's digital presence also reflects the campaign, with the Lang Realty website incorporating pink elements and the <a href="https://www.langrealty.com/lang-cares" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Lang Cares homepage</a> featuring campaign materials and donation links.</p><p>A significant financial commitment underpins the awareness efforts. Lang Realty agents will contribute $10 from each real estate closing during October, with the company matching those donations to double the impact. This matching program amplifies the financial support directed toward breast cancer programs and research. Dawn Forgione, a breast cancer survivor and longtime advocate for the initiative, expressed pride in her company's sustained commitment, highlighting how the Lang Realty community comes together each October through office decorations, group walks, and collective fundraising efforts.</p><p>The campaign represents Lang Realty's ongoing dedication to community engagement beyond real estate transactions. By mobilizing its network of more than 300 agents across multiple South Florida offices, the company creates a substantial platform for breast cancer awareness and fundraising. The initiative demonstrates how local businesses can leverage their resources and community connections to support important health causes that affect their stakeholders, with Forgione emphasizing that every contribution plays a meaningful role in supporting those affected by breast cancer.</p>
