<p>Integrated Cyber Solutions Inc. has engaged intellectual property counsel to pursue a patent application covering novel security methods focused on ML/AI deployment pipelines and data securitization, including quantum-resilient capabilities not currently available in the industry. This initiative marks a strategic inflection point for the company as it positions this innovation as the core technology underpinning its platform, providing a foundation for all current and future cybersecurity solutions.</p><p>According to Alan Guibord, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer of ICS, "AI is proving to be highly intelligent, but enterprise deployment has not been. Our approach changes that reality. By making secure, quantum-resilient AI deployment our core technology, we are creating a foundation that enables scalability, compliance, and resilience across all of our solutions." The patent will focus on methods addressing the greatest barriers enterprises face today, including secure, regulation-compliant global deployments of ML/AI models to protect sensitive data against breaches and attacks, including emerging quantum threats.</p><p>The technology encompasses data securitization techniques that ensure secured, encrypted, scalable AI training and inference pipelines complying with all major regulatory requirements including GDPR, CCPA, CPRA, ASA, HIPAA, and more. It protects ML/AI pipelines without hindering model visibility, monitoring and drift detection for model integrity and compliance, while providing zero-trust protections against adversarial and supply chain attacks.</p><p>Jeremy Samuelson, Advisor to ICS and member of the Company's Cyber Future Advisory Board, stated that "Enterprises want the power of AI solutions without the added complexity of figuring out compliance, security, scalability, and future proofing against emerging quantum risks. Our ML/AI deployment architectures ensure sensitive data and the models that use them are kept safe, while simultaneously allowing AI models to be orchestrated securely at scale and within the bounds of all relevant regulatory requirements."</p><p>By formalizing its intellectual property protection strategy, ICS is strengthening the defensibility of its platform and creating a competitive advantage that enhances both customer adoption and shareholder value. The technology provides audit-ready transparency enabling regulated industries to adopt AI with confidence, addressing critical security concerns in an increasingly quantum-threat landscape.</p>
