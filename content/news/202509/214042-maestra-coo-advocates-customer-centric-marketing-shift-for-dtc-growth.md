<p>Maryna Hradovich, Co-Founder and COO of Maestra, emphasizes the critical shift from channel-centric to customer-centric marketing as essential for direct-to-consumer brands seeking sustainable growth. Drawing from her experience scaling Semrush into a $300M+ revenue company, Hradovich now champions Maestra's all-in-one marketing platform that helps brands personalize beyond email and SMS to drive over 15% conversion increases.</p><p>The fundamental mindset change involves moving from optimizing individual channels in isolation to focusing on the customer's complete journey. "Instead of asking 'How do we improve our email open rates?', you ask 'What does Jane Smith need and prefer, and how do we meet her where she is?'" Hradovich explains. This approach delivers consistent, personalized experiences across all channels tailored to each individual's actual needs and preferences.</p><p>This shift has become urgent because modern consumers expect personalization as the norm, having grown accustomed to tailored experiences from platforms like Netflix, Spotify, and Amazon. Brands that excel at omnichannel, customer-focused engagement see dramatically higher retention and revenue. Maestra clients have achieved remarkable results, with Enlightened Equipment achieving 22% revenue growth in just two months with no extra spend, and swimwear brand Jolyn seeing 17% growth in total company revenue and 22% increase in repeated revenue.</p><p>The challenge for many marketers lies in tool overload and data silos created by managing multiple disconnected platforms. Hradovich notes that maintaining many niche tools often means paying for overlapping capabilities while creating endless integrations and broken connections. Consolidating tools into an all-in-one solution like Maestra can significantly reduce costs, as demonstrated by Furniture Fair achieving a 27% reduction in marketing stack costs. Additionally, unified platforms free up marketers' time by dozens of hours monthly that can be redirected toward strategy and creativity.</p><p>Maestra differentiates itself through what Hradovich describes as "Service-as-a-Software" - combining the scalability of software with high-touch service components. Every client receives a dedicated Customer Success Manager who handles implementation, from migrating data and building integrations to redesigning emails and creating flows. Unlike competitors who offer dedicated support only for premium clients, Maestra includes this service in all subscriptions and maintains a 15:1 client-to-CSM ratio rather than the industry standard 50+:1.</p><p>For DTC marketing leaders reviewing their tech stack, Hradovich advises focusing on three key areas: personalizing the entire customer journey beyond just email, consolidating fragmented tools to eliminate data silos, and finding strategic partners who can handle hands-on implementation. This approach works particularly well for mid-market brands that are big enough to see meaningful growth but shouldn't need to become tech experts to achieve it.</p>
