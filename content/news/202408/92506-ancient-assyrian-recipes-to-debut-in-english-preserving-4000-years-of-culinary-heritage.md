<p>The English debut of 'The Oldest Kitchen in the World: 4,000 Years of Middle Eastern Cooking Passed Down Through Generations' on September 24, 2024, marks a significant moment for culinary historians and enthusiasts alike. Compiled by Matay de Mayee, this cookbook brings to light ancient Assyrian recipes preserved through oral tradition, offering a rare insight into the culinary practices of the Suryoye people, whose heritage dates back to ancient Mesopotamia.</p><p>At the core of this publication is the story of Smuni Turan, de Mayee's mother, who, despite the historical gender disparities that prevented her from learning to read or write, is the true author of these recipes. This detail not only highlights the role of oral tradition in cultural preservation but also underscores the resilience of the Suryoye people in maintaining their identity and traditions across millennia.</p><p>The cookbook features a variety of dishes, from the ancient labiniyeh to the more familiar baklava, each presented with its original Aramaic name and accompanied by insights into their cultural significance. This blend of culinary instruction and historical context makes the book a valuable resource for understanding the customs and daily life of an ancient culture that continues to influence Middle Eastern cuisine today.</p><p>Endorsed by renowned food writer Nigel Slater as 'a rare and fascinating insight into an ancient and delicious cuisine,' the book appeals to both culinary enthusiasts and those interested in cultural history. Its publication is particularly timely, as globalization threatens to erode unique culinary traditions, making 'The Oldest Kitchen in the World' a crucial repository of Assyrian culinary heritage.</p><p>Matay de Mayee's personal connection to the material, combined with his modern European perspective, adds a unique dimension to the project. Published by Tra Publishing, known for its commitment to cultural and environmental awareness, the book is not only a collection of recipes but also a beautifully crafted object that celebrates the enduring power of food to connect us with our past.</p><p>As 'The Oldest Kitchen in the World' becomes available to a global audience, it offers a unique opportunity to explore one of the world's oldest cuisines, providing a window into the rich tapestry of human culinary history and the importance of preserving cultural heritage for future generations.</p>
