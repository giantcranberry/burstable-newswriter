<p>The global transition to renewable energy and electric vehicles is significantly increasing the demand for copper, a critical component in these technologies. Forecasts suggest a potential annual supply shortfall of 22 billion pounds by 2035, highlighting a substantial opportunity for copper mining companies. World Copper Ltd. (OTC: WCUFF), based in Vancouver, is leveraging this trend with its Zonia project in Arizona, a state responsible for 74% of the United States' copper production.</p><p>The Zonia project, encompassing 4,373 acres in Yavapai County, boasts considerable copper reserves, with 450.5 million pounds in Indicated Resources and 575.4 million pounds in Inferred Resources. CEO Gord Neal emphasized the potential of re-processing historically mined material to enhance the project's value and economic viability. This approach, coupled with the project's existing infrastructure and strategic location, positions World Copper favorably in the competitive copper market.</p><p>Environmental sustainability is a cornerstone of World Copper's operations. The company utilizes a solvent extraction-electrowinning (SX-EW) process, which reduces emissions by 38% compared to traditional smelting methods. This environmentally friendly method aligns with the growing emphasis on ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) criteria among investors, potentially making World Copper an attractive investment opportunity.</p><p>With copper prices reaching a two-year high and global consumption expected to increase by at least ten million metric tons over the next decade, the timing for World Copper's Zonia project is opportune. The project's favorable net present value (NPV) of $192 million at $3.00/lb copper and its potential for resource expansion underscore its significance in the evolving copper market. As the world continues to embrace electrification and renewable energy, companies like World Copper Ltd. are at the forefront of meeting the burgeoning demand for copper, playing a pivotal role in the transition to a greener future.</p>
