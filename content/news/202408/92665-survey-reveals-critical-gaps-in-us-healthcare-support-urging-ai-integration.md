<p>A recent survey by Hyro, a healthcare AI communications company, has brought to light the severe consequences of support friction within the US healthcare system, affecting patient health and satisfaction. The study, involving over 1,500 participants, uncovers a pressing need for healthcare providers to overhaul their support mechanisms, particularly in prescription refills and appointment scheduling, to mitigate health complications and improve patient engagement.</p><p>Key findings from the 'Voice of the Patient' survey reveal that 21% of patients delay or avoid refilling prescriptions due to cumbersome processes, leading to health complications for 32% of them. Furthermore, 81% of respondents advocate for more self-service options in scheduling appointments, and 84% prefer interacting with an AI assistant over enduring long hold times for human agents. These preferences underscore a growing demand for healthcare experiences that align with the convenience and efficiency of other service industries.</p><p>The survey also notes that 66% of patients expect their healthcare providers to adopt generative AI technologies within the year to enhance support services. However, this enthusiasm is tempered by concerns over data privacy, with 33% of respondents wary of sharing personal health information with AI systems. Israel Krush, CEO of Hyro, emphasizes the importance of addressing these concerns through responsible AI implementation that prioritizes compliance and patient trust.</p><p>This survey serves as a critical indicator for healthcare providers to innovate and integrate AI-powered solutions that can streamline operations, reduce patient frustration, and prevent health setbacks. The findings advocate for a patient-centric approach in healthcare delivery, leveraging technology to meet evolving expectations and improve overall health outcomes.</p>
