<p>Mullen Automotive, through its subsidiary Bollinger Motors, has announced a significant expansion of its commercial electric vehicle (EV) dealer network by partnering with TEC Equipment, Inc. This collaboration adds 20 select sales and service locations across the Western United States, including Arizona, California, and Washington, among others. This strategic expansion not only extends Bollinger Motors' geographical reach but also fortifies its stance in the competitive EV market.</p><p>Jim Connelly, Chief Revenue Officer for Bollinger Motors, highlighted the partnership's significance, noting TEC Equipment's esteemed reputation in sales and service. This alliance is a pivotal step towards fulfilling Bollinger's commitment to electrification and customer support, especially in crucial markets.</p><p>The timing of this expansion is noteworthy, as Mullen Automotive has been making significant progress in the EV sector. The company commenced commercial vehicle production in Tunica, Mississippi, in August 2023 and secured IRS approval for federal EV tax credits on its commercial vehicles the following month. These developments, coupled with the Qualified Manufacturer designation, offer eligible customers up to $7,500 per vehicle, potentially enhancing sales and adoption rates.</p><p>Mullen's product offerings, including the CARB and EPA-certified Mullen ONE and Mullen THREE, cater to commercial applications, underscoring the company's dedication to sustainable transportation solutions. The expansion of Bollinger Motors' dealer network is poised to significantly impact the commercial EV market in the Western U.S., facilitating easier access to EVs and services for fleet operators and businesses.</p><p>This expansion reflects broader industry shifts towards electrification and sustainability, as businesses increasingly seek to minimize their environmental impact and adhere to stricter emissions standards. For Mullen Automotive, this move is a strategic effort to cement its market presence and compete with legacy automakers venturing into the commercial EV space.</p><p>The partnership between Bollinger Motors and TEC Equipment exemplifies the critical role of dealer and service network expansions in advancing commercial transportation's electrification. Such initiatives are instrumental in promoting emission reductions, improving air quality, and fostering sustainable mobility solutions nationwide.</p>
