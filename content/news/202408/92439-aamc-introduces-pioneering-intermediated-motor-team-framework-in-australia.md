<p>The Australian motor insurance industry is witnessing a transformative development with the introduction of the Intermediated Motor Team (IMT) framework by AAMC. This innovative approach, the first of its kind in the country, is set to redefine motor vehicle accident management by initiating expert intervention from the moment an incident occurs.</p><p>Established in 2002 by Steve Chapman and Simon Manolaros, AAMC has emerged as a nationwide leader in motor vehicle accident management services. The company's latest initiative, the IMT framework, addresses longstanding gaps in the motor loss assessing market by offering a structured, consistent service that benefits all stakeholders involved in a motor vehicle accident.</p><p>The IMT model ensures that AAMC takes charge of all accident management activities immediately after an incident, including damage triage, communication facilitation, repair estimates, and the assessment process. This early intervention strategy is designed to expedite claims processing, reduce delays, and enhance satisfaction among brokers, insurers, and clients alike.</p><p>For brokers, the IMT framework enhances their insurance offerings by enabling a high-quality, best-practice claims capability. This not only provides immediate support to clients during critical times but also mitigates costs and identifies damage early, ensuring a smoother claims process.</p><p>The transparency and efficiency of the IMT framework are expected to significantly improve stakeholder satisfaction. AAMC's commitment to operational excellence and its nationwide approach have set a new standard in an industry previously dominated by small, localized providers.</p><p>As the largest provider of specialist accident management and assessing services in Australia, AAMC continues to innovate, offering comprehensive solutions that include customer interaction centers, dedicated suppliers for vehicle damage reinstatement, and in-house assessors and technical experts. The introduction of the IMT framework marks a pivotal moment in the evolution of motor insurance claims management, promising to shape the future of the industry.</p>
