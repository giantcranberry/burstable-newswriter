<p>A new study by HR.com's HR Research Institute (HRRI) sheds light on the pressing challenges organizations face in employee communication and collaboration. With only 15% of organizations reaching the top two levels of HRRI's communication maturity model and a mere 31% rating their communication effectiveness as high or very high, the findings underscore a widespread issue. The study, aimed at aiding employers and HR departments, reveals a general dissatisfaction with current communication practices, pointing to a critical area for improvement.</p><p>Key factors for successful communication in leading organizations include effective measurement of communication efforts and higher communication maturity levels. These organizations are 19 times more likely to measure their communication effectively and 10 times more likely to be at the highest stage of communication maturity. However, the study also identifies significant gaps in managerial communication, with only 47% of respondents believing their managers actively listen, 35% thinking managers are well-trained in communication skills, and 28% stating managers have access to good communication metrics.</p><p>Debbie McGrath, CEO of HR.com, highlights the importance of these findings, noting the critical need for organizations to strengthen their communication strategies. The implications are vast, affecting employee engagement, productivity, and workplace success. Poor communication practices may lead to misunderstandings, reduced efficiency, and lower employee satisfaction, hindering organizational performance.</p><p>To address these challenges, the study suggests investing in communication training for managers, implementing effective measurement tools, and developing mature communication strategies. The full research report, <a href='https://www.hr.com' rel='nofollow' target='_blank'>HR.com's State of Employee Communications and Collaboration 2024-25</a>, offers detailed insights and recommendations. Additionally, a webcast recording, <a href='https://www.hr.com' rel='nofollow' target='_blank'>The Winning Formula: Communication + Action = Collaboration</a>, is available for on-demand viewing. As workplaces evolve, especially with remote and hybrid arrangements, the study serves as a crucial call to action for organizations to enhance their communication strategies for long-term success and employee satisfaction.</p>
