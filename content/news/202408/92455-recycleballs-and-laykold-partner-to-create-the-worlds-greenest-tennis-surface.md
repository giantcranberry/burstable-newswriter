<p>The collaboration between RecycleBalls and Laykold marks a pivotal step towards sustainability in the tennis industry, introducing an innovative solution to the environmental challenge posed by discarded tennis balls. By integrating recycled tennis balls into Laykold's court systems, the partnership not only addresses the issue of waste but also enhances the sustainability of tennis infrastructure worldwide.</p><p>With over 150 million tennis balls imported into the USA in 2023 alone, the environmental impact is undeniable. These balls, which take more than 400 years to decompose in landfills, contribute significantly to carbon emissions. The partnership's approach to repurposing up to 10,000 recycled balls per court offers a sustainable alternative, reducing the carbon footprint associated with tennis ball waste.</p><p>RecycleBalls' extensive network and Laykold's global installation presence ensure that this initiative will have a wide-reaching impact, from professional tournaments to local clubs. The collaboration not only exemplifies how the sports industry can lead in environmental sustainability but also sets a precedent for other sports to follow.</p><p>Dave Wheaton of Laykold and Erin Cunningham of RecycleBalls both emphasize the importance of this partnership in addressing the urgent environmental issues of our time. Their shared vision for a future where recycling sports equipment is the norm highlights the potential for significant environmental benefits across the sports industry.</p><p>This initiative by Laykold, as part of the Sport Group, underscores a broader commitment to environmental sustainability within the sports surface business. By transforming waste into valuable resources for new court construction, the partnership between RecycleBalls and Laykold not only advances the sustainability of tennis but also inspires similar efforts in other sports, paving the way for a greener future in sports infrastructure.</p>
