<p>The Copper Property CTL Pass Through Trust has scheduled a pivotal conference call for August 13, 2024, offering a deep dive into its financial and operational results. This event is crucial for investors and stakeholders keen on understanding the Trust's progress in managing and selling its substantial real estate holdings from J.C. Penney's bankruptcy.</p><p>During the call, the Trust's management will discuss the monthly report for July 31, 2024, and the Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2024. These documents, to be filed ahead of the call, will provide a foundation for the discussion, highlighting the Trust's financial status and operational achievements. The inclusion of a Q&A session promises direct engagement with management, offering insights into future strategies and market conditions affecting the Trust's objectives.</p><p>The Trust's portfolio, encompassing 160 retail properties and 6 warehouse distribution centers, is a significant asset in the commercial real estate sector. The performance and eventual sale of these properties are central to the Trust's mission of generating returns for its unit holders. Access to the conference call is available via dial-in for U.S., Canada, and international participants, with a webcast option on the Trust's website at <a href='https://www.ctltrust.net' rel='nofollow' target='_blank'>https://www.ctltrust.net</a> under the Investor Relations section.</p><p>For those unable to attend live, a 30-day replay will be available, ensuring broad access to the discussed insights. The Trust's approach to transparency, through regular financial reporting and updates, underscores its commitment to stakeholder communication. This is particularly vital given its structure as a liquidating trust focused on property sales and distribution of proceeds.</p><p>The conference call is not just a routine update but a significant event for those tracking the Trust's journey or the commercial real estate market's dynamics, especially in the retail sector. As the Trust advances towards its goal of liquidating its portfolio, the outcomes of these efforts will serve as a barometer for the retail real estate market's health and the sector's adaptation to post-bankruptcy landscapes.</p>
