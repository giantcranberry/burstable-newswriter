<p>Sky Quarry Inc., an integrated energy solutions company, has taken a significant step towards its planned Nasdaq listing by announcing the commencement of its Regulation A (Reg A) investment round. This strategic move underscores the company's ambition to lead in the waste-to-energy sector, particularly through its innovative recycling of waste asphalt shingles into sustainable fuels and other materials.</p><p>The company addresses a critical environmental issue by recycling approximately 15 million tons of asphalt shingles that would otherwise end up in U.S. landfills annually. Sky Quarry's patented process not only mitigates this waste management challenge but also creates seven distinct revenue streams, showcasing a viable business model that aligns with global eco-friendly trends.</p><p>With addressable markets projected to reach a combined $25 billion by 2035, Sky Quarry's growth potential is substantial. The company has bolstered its capabilities through the acquisition of two key processing facilities: an advanced oil extraction facility in Utah and a 5,000 barrel-per-day oil refinery in Nevada. These assets enable Sky Quarry to manage the entire process from extraction to refining, a testament to its integrated strategy.</p><p>In 2023, the company's refinery generated over $50 million in revenue, highlighting the effectiveness of its approach. The planned launch of a fully retrofitted flagship extraction facility in 2025, capable of producing up to 2,000 barrels of sustainable oil daily, is expected to further enhance Sky Quarry's market position.</p><p>David Sealock, Chairman, CEO, and Co-founder of Sky Quarry, emphasized the company's unique position in the energy and waste management industries. The Reg A offering, managed by Digital Offering, LLC, presents an opportunity for investors to contribute to Sky Quarry's growth and support its Nasdaq listing ambitions.</p><p>Sky Quarry's innovative recycling process offers a dual solution to environmental and economic challenges, promoting resource efficiency and reducing landfill waste. As the global community increasingly prioritizes sustainability, Sky Quarry's model could inspire similar waste-to-energy solutions across industries, marking a significant step towards a more sustainable future.</p>
