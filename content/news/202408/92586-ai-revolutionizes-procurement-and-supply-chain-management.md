Julian Harris, founder and CEO of RobobAI, underscores the transformative potential of AI in three critical areas: supply chain visibility, B2B payment optimization, and risk management.</p><p>Firstly, AI addresses the challenge of fragmented data sources in supply chains by aggregating spending and payments data.

This allows companies to swiftly identify and address compliance breaches, mitigating risks in an increasingly complex regulatory environment.</p><p>The adoption of AI in supply chain management promises significant benefits for businesses, including cost savings, improved cash flow, and stronger supplier relationships. On a global scale, AI-driven supply chains could enhance resilience against disruptions, such as those witnessed during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>With over 30 years of experience in technology and leadership roles, Harris brings valuable insights into the potential of AI to transform industries. As AI technologies advance, early adopters stand to gain a competitive advantage, leveraging these tools to navigate the intricacies of global trade more effectively.</p><p>The integration of AI into supply chain management marks a pivotal shift in business operations, with the potential to drive efficiencies and reshape industries worldwide.
