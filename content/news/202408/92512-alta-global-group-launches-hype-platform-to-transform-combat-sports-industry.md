<p>Alta Global Group (NYSE American:MMA) has announced the nationwide rollout of its newly acquired marketing platform, Hype, targeting combat sports gym partners across the United States. This strategic move is set to revolutionize the combat sports industry's approach to monetizing social media followers and enhancing member engagement, while simultaneously positioning Alta for substantial revenue growth.</p><p>Hype is a comprehensive solution that functions as a mini-website builder, customer relationship management (CRM) system, and payment processor, all accessible via smartphone. The platform addresses key challenges faced by businesses reliant on social media for growth, such as limited bio links and algorithm-dependent communication with followers. By enabling efficient conversion of social media followings and providing direct communication channels, Hype offers business owners greater control over their potential customer base.</p><p>The launch of Hype aligns with Alta's long-term mission of converting 640 million combat sports fans into active participants. The platform's community-oriented nature is particularly well-suited to combat sports gyms, where strong relationships and referrals are crucial. This network effect could significantly enhance Hype's adoption among gym owners, coaches, and athlete influencers within each gym community.</p><p>Alta Global Group's revenue potential from Hype is considerable, given its Software as a Service (SaaS) model. With subscription pricing ranging from $39 to $299 per month and transaction fees of up to 5%, Hype is currently generating approximately $200,000 per year in recurring revenue. However, this figure is poised for exponential growth as the platform expands its reach.</p><p>The US martial arts industry presents a vast market for Hype, with approximately 45,000 gyms currently in operation and a projected increase to 67,000 by 2026. Additionally, the platform can cater to a network of at least 100,000 coaches and 11.8 million active participants in the US alone. This expansive user base offers significant opportunities for subscription and transaction-based revenue.</p><p>Nick Langton, founder and CEO of Alta Global Group, emphasized the mutual benefits of Hype for both the company and its partners: 'We have a great opportunity here to help our gym partners, coaches, and athletes better monetize their infrastructure and content while Alta Global Group benefits from the subscription-based monthly recurring revenue stream.'</p><p>From an investor's perspective, the potential impact on Alta's revenue is substantial. Capturing just 10% of the US martial arts gym market at a mid-tier price of $99 per month could generate at least $5 million in additional revenue for Alta, with minimal added costs. At the premium price point of $299 per month, this figure could reach up to $15 million, excluding transaction fees.</p><p>Hype's versatility extends beyond combat sports gyms, making it applicable to a wide range of businesses. With approximately 27.1 million sole proprietorship businesses in the US, Hype could become a key tool for driving conversions from social media followings across various industries.</p><p>The platform's comprehensive feature set positions it as a competitor to established SaaS brands in website creation, CRM, and payment processing. By combining functionalities from multiple services, Hype offers a tailored solution for combat sports gyms, potentially reducing the need for multiple subscriptions.</p><p>Alta Global Group's current market capitalization of around $30 million suggests significant room for growth as Hype's rollout gains momentum. The company's strategic focus on leveraging social media for customer acquisition addresses a critical need in today's digital marketplace, offering an efficient way for businesses to convert social media followers into their own sales funnels.</p><p>While initially targeting combat sports gyms, Hype's potential extends to other sectors such as community sports and various athlete categories. This diversification opportunity further enhances Alta Global Group's growth prospects and potential shareholder value.</p>
