<p>Mariner has significantly expanded its financial advisory capabilities through the acquisition of Woodbridge International, a New Haven, Connecticut-based mergers and acquisitions firm. This strategic move, finalized on August 30, 2024, leverages Woodbridge's 30-year expertise and global reach, enhancing Mariner's sell-side M&A advisory services.</p><p>Woodbridge International brings to Mariner its innovative approach to sell-side M&A transactions and a vast global database, including 8,400 private equity groups and 410,000 strategic companies. This acquisition is a transformative step for Mariner, aligning with its mission to deliver comprehensive, client-focused financial services. Marty Bicknell, CEO and president of Mariner, highlighted the synergy between Woodbridge's client-centric solutions and Mariner's core values.</p><p>The timing of this acquisition is pivotal, with 35% of financial advisors expected to retire in the next decade and $17 trillion in small businesses anticipated to be sold in the next 20 years. Mariner's enhanced capabilities are set to support its 1,200 business owner clients through these transitions. Robert Koenig, CEO of Woodbridge International, sees this merger as an opportunity to potentially double the business in the coming years, especially with the anticipated wave of baby boomer business exits.</p><p>Integration of Woodbridge's team and operations into Mariner's structure is expected to be completed by the end of the year, with Woodbridge maintaining its current offices and brand during the transition. This acquisition marks a significant milestone for Mariner, which, since its founding in 2006 with $300 million in assets under advisement, now advises on over $245 billion in assets as of June 30, 2024.</p><p>The merger of Mariner and Woodbridge International is a strategic response to the evolving financial advisory landscape, combining comprehensive wealth management with specialized M&A expertise. This positions the firm to better address the complex needs of business owners and high-net-worth individuals in a competitive market. The acquisition also reflects the broader trend of consolidation in the financial advisory sector, as firms seek to expand their services and market reach.</p><p>For clients, this merger offers access to a wider range of services and expertise, promising more comprehensive financial strategies. The enhanced M&A advisory services are particularly timely as many business owners consider retirement and exit strategies. With the integration of Woodbridge's global network, Mariner is set to influence middle-market M&A trends, potentially serving as a model for other firms looking to expand their capabilities.</p>
