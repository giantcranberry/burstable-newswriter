<p>Aclarion, Inc., a leader in healthcare technology focused on chronic low back pain identification, has unveiled a pioneering initiative to establish a statewide network of providers in New Jersey. This network will leverage Aclarion's Nociscan technology to assess chronic low back pain in personal injury and workers compensation cases, marking a potential shift in the evaluation and treatment processes for such conditions.</p><p>Spearheaded by Dr. Justin Kubeck, an orthopedic surgeon and the founder of Ocean Pain and Spine in Toms River, NJ, the program seeks to enhance the objective assessment of chronic low back pain patients within the intricate personal injury and workers compensation frameworks. The significance of this initiative is underscored by the substantial financial implications involved, with New Jersey's average settlement for neck and back injury claims reaching $918,967, and national averages for work-related injuries at $148,750.</p><p>Nociscan, Aclarion's innovative solution, employs Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) alongside advanced AI algorithms to pinpoint the origins of chronic low back pain. This technology provides clinicians with objective data on lumbar disc biomarkers related to pain and structural integrity, offering a decisive tool in legal scenarios where concrete evidence is paramount.</p><p>Dr. Kubeck highlighted the technology's legal relevance, stating, "The necessity for an objective and definitive diagnosis in these claims is critical, especially when diagnoses may be contested in legal proceedings. Nociscan serves as a robust objective measurement tool to substantiate appropriate treatment pathways."</p><p>The initiative's reach extends beyond New Jersey, with Ryan Bond, Aclarion's Chief Strategy Officer, outlining plans to expand the network across the United States following its establishment in New Jersey. This expansion could revolutionize the assessment and management of chronic low back pain in personal injury and workers compensation cases on a national scale.</p><p>Nociscan's methodology involves analyzing MRS data from MRI scans of lumbar discs, utilizing proprietary techniques to identify and quantify chemical biomarkers linked to disc pain. This data is then processed through algorithms to determine potential pain sources, offering invaluable insights when combined with other diagnostic methods.</p><p>The implications of this initiative for the healthcare and legal sectors are profound. By introducing more objective data into cases traditionally reliant on subjective pain evaluations, Nociscan could refine the assessment process, leading to more precise diagnoses, suitable treatments, and equitable compensation for those affected.</p><p>For the medical field, Nociscan represents a novel approach to managing chronic pain. For the legal system, it offers a firmer foundation for adjudicating personal injury and workers compensation claims. Patients stand to benefit from quicker, more accurate diagnoses and tailored treatment plans.</p><p>As Aclarion progresses with this initiative, the focus will be on its execution and efficacy. Success could establish a new benchmark for chronic low back pain evaluation in both medical and legal contexts, offering advantages to patients, healthcare professionals, and the legal community.</p>
