<p>RJD Green Inc. (OTCPK: RJDG) has taken a significant step to expand its Silex Holdings division by acquiring key assets from JSI Interiors. This strategic move includes a state-of-the-art fabrication system, contracts, purchase orders, and a book of business, positioning Silex Holdings for enhanced growth in the specialty construction products market. The combined revenues of Silex Holdings and JSI Interiors for 2023 were $7,813,426, underscoring the acquisition's scale.</p><p>To streamline the integration of these assets, Silex Holdings has established JSI Products Corporation as a new division. Ron Brewer, CEO of RJD Green, highlighted the acquisition's potential, citing plans to leverage proven business operation processes that have previously driven Silex Interiors' revenue growth from $1.4 million to $5.8 million annually. The acquisition is expected to significantly boost production capabilities and market reach, with the Tulsa Division projected to generate $3 million to $4 million in revenue in its first year.</p><p>Silex Holdings aims to expand its business outreach across northeast Oklahoma, targeting a 200-mile radius for commercial projects. The company has set a goal to achieve $10 million in profitable revenue, reinforcing its niche market strategy between box stores and local contractors. Specializing in installed stone and engineered stone countertops, cabinets, and related products, Silex Holdings serves a diverse clientele including residential builders, commercial projects, remodel contractors, and retail customers.</p><p>This acquisition not only strengthens RJD Green's portfolio but also signals its commitment to growth in the specialty construction sector. With RJD Green operating across healthcare services, environmental services, and now an expanded Silex Holdings division, the company is poised for increased competitiveness and market share in Oklahoma and beyond. The move reflects a broader industry trend towards consolidation and strategic growth, potentially influencing future acquisitions within the specialty construction sector.</p><p>While the company is optimistic about the acquisition's impact, it acknowledges the inherent risks and uncertainties of forward-looking statements. Investors are encouraged to consult RJD Green's SEC filings for a detailed risk assessment. This acquisition represents a pivotal moment for RJD Green and the specialty construction industry, highlighting the importance of strategic growth initiatives in achieving long-term success.</p>
