<p>MOGABI AMT INC. has unveiled the MOGABI V3 Electric Guitar on Kickstarter, a revolutionary instrument designed for musicians who prioritize portability without compromising on sound quality. Following the success of their previous campaign, the company has incorporated feedback from nearly 400 backers to enhance the V3 model, making it a standout in the portable instrument market.</p><p>The MOGABI V3 features a fan-shaped audio box that improves sound quality by over 20%, offering musicians a richer bass response and clearer sound. This design innovation also minimizes howling, making the guitar ideal for outdoor performances without the need for external amplification. Additionally, the guitar's compatibility with effectors and its ability to record both original and effect sounds simultaneously cater to the needs of one-man-band performers.</p><p>Technical advancements include a 40mm full-range 10W speaker, SPC 79dB/W high-output sound, and a 15-level volume control, ensuring low-noise performance for both live and recorded sessions. The built-in microphone preamp further enhances its versatility, allowing for multi-layered performances.</p><p>Perhaps the most notable feature is the V3's foldable design, which utilizes a unique hinge mechanism to reduce the guitar's size by half for easy transport. This innovation addresses the challenges faced by traveling musicians, making the MOGABI V3 an essential tool for those on the move.</p><p>The launch on Kickstarter not only offers the guitar at a discounted price but also serves as a platform for MOGABI AMT INC. to gather feedback for future improvements. As the music industry leans towards mobility and versatility, the MOGABI V3 Electric Guitar is set to redefine music performance and creation for traveling musicians.</p>
