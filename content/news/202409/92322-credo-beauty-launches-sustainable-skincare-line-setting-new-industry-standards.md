<p>Credo Beauty, a leader in the clean beauty sector, has announced the launch of its proprietary skincare line, Credo Skincare, on September 12, 2024. This initiative reflects the company's decade-long commitment to clean beauty and sustainability, addressing the primary concern of its clientele: hydration. The line features six products, including cleansers and moisturizers, priced at $44 and $64 respectively, tailored to combat various skin issues such as dryness, sensitivity, and aging.</p><p>At the heart of Credo Skincare's innovation is the use of upcycled vetiver root extract, sourced ethically from Haiti, known for its antioxidant properties that enhance skin texture and barrier protection. Clinical trials underscore the line's effectiveness, with a 27% hydration improvement after 24 hours and a 31% instant boost, alongside enhanced skin barrier function.</p><p>Credo Beauty's dedication to environmental stewardship is evident in its packaging collaboration with Pact Collective. The skincare line utilizes a groundbreaking PCR resin, NewMatter, derived from recycled beauty packaging, significantly reducing virgin plastic use and landfill waste. This effort not only conserves resources but also sets a precedent for sustainable practices in the beauty industry.</p><p>Annie Jackson, Co-Founder and CEO of Credo Beauty, highlights the brand's ambition to elevate clean beauty standards through innovation and transparency. The launch of Credo Skincare exemplifies how retailers can harness customer insights and sustainability to redefine industry norms, offering products that are both effective and environmentally responsible.</p><p>Available at Credo's physical stores and online at <a href='https://www.credobeauty.com' rel='nofollow' target='_blank'>https://www.credobeauty.com</a>, Credo Skincare's debut is anticipated to influence the broader beauty market, encouraging a shift towards more sustainable and consumer-focused product development.</p>
