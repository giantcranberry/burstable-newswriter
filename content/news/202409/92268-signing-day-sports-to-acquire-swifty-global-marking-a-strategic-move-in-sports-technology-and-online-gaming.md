Currently, Signing Day Sports operates primarily in the USA, with a focus on football and soccer, boasting over 10,000 registered users.</p><p>The synergy between the two companies is expected to unlock global growth opportunities and monetization potential. Signing Day Sports benefits from an influential investor base, including professional sports team owners, which could facilitate Swifty's entry into the U.S. market. James Gibbons, CEO of Swifty Global, views this acquisition as a milestone that offers greater exposure, capital, and credibility. Similarly, Daniel Nelson, CEO of Signing Day Sports, sees the partnership as a means to enhance shareholder value through technological and financial advantages.</p><p>With the closing agreements anticipated by early October, pending legal and regulatory approvals, this acquisition could redefine the competitive landscape of the sports technology and online gaming sectors.
