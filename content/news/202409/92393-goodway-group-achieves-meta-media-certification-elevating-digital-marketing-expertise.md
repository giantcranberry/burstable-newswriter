<p>Goodway Group has recently been awarded the Meta Media Certification, a significant milestone that underscores its expertise in digital marketing, particularly on Meta's platforms, including Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp. This certification comes at a pivotal moment as Meta is projected to dominate the U.S. advertising landscape in 2024, with forecasts indicating it will account for 21.3% of digital ad spend and 74.5% of social network ad spend.</p><p>The certification process required Goodway Group to meet Meta's rigorous standards, with an impressive 73% of eligible team members achieving certification. This achievement not only validates the agency's commitment to excellence but also enhances its ability to deliver superior results for clients through its Outcome Engineering approach. By leveraging Meta's advanced tools and insights, Goodway Group is now better positioned to optimize client campaigns and drive meaningful outcomes.</p><p>The significance of this certification is magnified by Meta's growing influence in the digital advertising world. With projected U.S. ad revenues of $64.63 billion in 2024 and a global user base of 3 billion across its apps, the ability to effectively navigate Meta's platforms is crucial for agencies aiming to maximize client investments. Goodway Group's certification is already proving its value, as demonstrated in a recent case study with jewelry brand Tacori, where the use of Meta's Conversions API (CAPI) Gateway led to an 18% increase in bookings to view jewelry for purchase and a 27% decrease in CPMs.</p><p>Stephani Estes, Chief Media Officer at Goodway Group, highlighted the importance of this achievement, noting that it not only recognizes the talent of their team but also strengthens their capability to deliver top-tier results for clients. This certification assures clients that their campaigns are managed by experts rigorously tested and certified by one of the leading digital platforms, reinforcing Goodway Group's reputation as a leader in innovative, outcome-driven digital marketing solutions.</p><p>As the digital advertising landscape continues to evolve, with Meta playing a central role, Goodway Group's Meta Media Certification equips the agency to navigate these changes effectively. It enables the creation of more connected online customer journeys through holistic omni-channel marketing strategies, with Meta's platforms serving as a core component.
