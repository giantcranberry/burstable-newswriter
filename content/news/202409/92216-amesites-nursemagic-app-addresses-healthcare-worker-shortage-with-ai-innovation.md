<p>Amesite (NASDAQ: AMST) has introduced NurseMagic, an AI-powered application designed to mitigate the pressing issues of nurse burnout and healthcare worker shortages. This innovative tool is rapidly gaining popularity among healthcare professionals by simplifying nursing documentation and supporting various healthcare tasks, marking a significant step forward in the industry's fight against workforce challenges.</p><p>The healthcare sector is currently facing a dire shortage of nurses, with projections indicating that more than one in four nurses may leave the profession by 2027. NurseMagic addresses this crisis by automating nursing notes, a task that consumes up to 40% of nurses' time, thereby enhancing efficiency and allowing more focus on patient care. Additionally, the app provides valuable features such as simplifying medical procedures for patients, crafting work emails, and offering advice on patient communication and medication details.</p><p>Since its beta release, NurseMagic has seen exponential growth, with user registrations increasing by triple digits monthly. Its successful launch in the Apple App Store, where it quickly rose to #33 in the medical category and received five-star reviews, underscores its impact. Currently, healthcare professionals across all 50 U.S. states and six countries are utilizing the app.</p><p>The app's reliability is backed by over 20 proprietary AI models trained on qualified data sources, achieving a 93% accuracy rate against NCLEX exam questions. This high level of performance is a key factor in its widespread adoption. Amesite is now extending NurseMagic's reach into the enterprise market, initiating pilot programs with five home health agencies and skilled nursing facilities. These programs could potentially benefit over 30,000 employees, with Amesite projecting a 15X return on investment for enterprise clients through improved efficiency.</p><p>The home healthcare sector, expected to grow from $100 billion to $176 billion by 2032, presents a significant opportunity for NurseMagic. With annual job growth in this area projected at 21% through 2032, Amesite is strategically positioning itself to meet the demands of this expanding market. As the healthcare industry continues to navigate workforce shortages and burnout, AI-driven solutions like NurseMagic are proving to be essential tools in enhancing operational efficiency and supporting the well-being of healthcare professionals.</p>
