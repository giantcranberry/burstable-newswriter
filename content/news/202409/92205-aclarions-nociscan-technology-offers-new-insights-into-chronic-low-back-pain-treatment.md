<p>Aclarion, Inc.'s Nociscan solution has significantly advanced the understanding of Modic changes (MC) in patients with chronic low back pain (cLBP), as revealed at the 50th International Society for the Study of the Lumbar Spine Annual Meeting. The study, involving 88 patients, utilized Nociscan's magnetic resonance spectroscopy to measure intradiscal propionic acid levels, challenging previous notions about the disc environment's sterility and offering new diagnostic and treatment pathways.</p><p>The research, led by Dr. Aaron Fields, underscores the potential of PA levels in predicting treatment responsiveness among cLBP patients with MC. Aclarion's Nociscan emerges as a pioneering SaaS platform, enabling noninvasive differentiation between painful and nonpainful discs through chemical biomarker quantification. This innovation is pivotal, given that spinal degeneration and low back pain affect 266 million people globally, with MC being a critical focus area.</p><p>Ryan Bond of Aclarion emphasized the technology's role in enhancing patient care decisions by providing noninvasive diagnostic information. The study's findings hint at future research avenues, including antibiotic treatment for cLBP patients with elevated PA levels, promising more personalized and effective therapies.</p><p>The presentation at the ISSLS meeting highlights the medical community's growing reliance on advanced diagnostic tools like Nociscan for spinal conditions. As the understanding of cLBP's biopsychosocial mechanisms deepens, Nociscan's ability to offer objective data on disc pain biomarkers is set to transform treatment strategies, marking a significant leap forward in managing this pervasive condition.</p>
