<p>Cardio Diagnostics (NASDAQ: CDIO), a pioneer in AI-driven cardiovascular disease prevention, awaits a pivotal decision from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) regarding payment determinations for its Epi+Gen CHD and PrecisionCHD tests. This decision, expected this month, could dramatically improve the accessibility of these innovative diagnostics to Medicare beneficiaries, addressing the leading cause of death in this population.</p><p>Heart disease, particularly coronary heart disease (CHD), is the most common cause of heart attacks and claimed 371,506 lives in the U.S. in 2022. Cardio Diagnostics' tests offer a breakthrough in CHD risk assessment and diagnosis. The Epi+Gen CHD test employs AI to evaluate genetic and epigenetic markers for a three-year risk assessment of symptomatic CHD events, while PrecisionCHD aids in diagnosing the condition. Both tests have received unique CPT codes from the American Medical Association, effective April 2024, facilitating their adoption into standard care.</p><p>The integration of these tests with the Actionable Clinical Intelligence (ACI) platform provides healthcare providers with personalized insights into the underlying causes of CHD, marking a significant advancement in personalized cardiovascular medicine. A favorable CMS decision could not only make these tests more accessible to Medicare patients but also encourage the broader adoption of AI-powered diagnostic tools in cardiovascular care.</p><p>The implications of this decision extend beyond Cardio Diagnostics, potentially setting a precedent for the evaluation and pricing of AI-driven medical technologies for Medicare coverage. It represents a critical step forward in the fight against heart disease, offering the promise of earlier interventions, better patient outcomes, and reduced healthcare costs associated with late-stage disease treatment.</p><p>As the healthcare industry evolves, the CMS's decision on Cardio Diagnostics' tests underscores the increasing role of AI and precision medicine in tackling major health challenges. The outcome could significantly influence the future of cardiovascular care for the aging population, marking a milestone in efforts to improve heart health outcomes nationwide.</p>
