<p>CleanCore Solutions, Inc. (AMEX: ZONE), a pioneer in ozone-infused water cleaning technology, has announced its annual financial results for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2024, showcasing a strategic pivot towards direct sales and notable financial improvements. This shift has not only enhanced the company's gross margins from 29.9% in 2023 to 49.6% in 2024 but also positioned CleanCore for potential growth in the burgeoning market for eco-friendly cleaning solutions.</p><p>Despite a revenue decrease from $2.4 million in 2023 to $1.6 million in 2024, CleanCore achieved a 9% increase in gross profit, attributing the revenue dip to the transitional phase of its new sales strategy. The company's strategic adjustments have led to a record level of potential order volume in its sales pipeline, signaling promising future growth opportunities. With a stable cash position of nearly $2 million, CleanCore is well-equipped to sustain operations for over two years at current levels, projecting positive cash flow within the next 12 months.</p><p>Significant cost-cutting measures have also played a crucial role in narrowing the company's net loss from over $5 million in 2023 to $2.3 million in 2024. A more than 56% reduction in general and administrative expenses underscores CleanCore's commitment to operational efficiency and financial health. CEO Clayton Adams highlighted the company's alignment with the increasing demand for sustainable cleaning solutions, backed by industry projections of a $93 billion market by 2027.</p><p>CleanCore's recent contracts with a leading U.S. university, a major southwestern airport, and a global logistics company underscore the growing adoption of its aqueous ozone cleaning systems in key sectors. These systems offer a healthier, more sustainable alternative to traditional cleaning chemicals, aligning with the shift towards environmentally responsible practices. As the market continues to evolve, CleanCore's innovative technology and strategic positioning may well herald a new era of growth and sustainability in the cleaning solutions industry.</p>
