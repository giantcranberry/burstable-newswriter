<p>A consortium of leading broadband organizations has unveiled a strategic paper designed to simplify the permitting process for Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and local governments. Titled 'Permitting Success: Closing the Digital Divide Through Local Broadband Permitting,' the guide seeks to fast-track the deployment of high-speed internet, particularly in underserved areas. This initiative is timely, aligning with the Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment (BEAD) program's rollout, which marks the largest broadband infrastructure investment in U.S. history.</p><p>The paper, a collaborative effort by the Benton Institute for Broadband & Society, Georgetown Law Institute for Technology Law & Policy, among others, offers practical solutions to the permitting challenges that could hinder the BEAD program's success. It emphasizes the importance of partnerships, resource optimization, and transparency in the permitting process. Drew Garner of the Benton Institute highlighted the paper's role in ensuring local permitting offices operate efficiently, a critical factor in bridging the digital divide.</p><p>The document's insights are derived from a national summit that gathered over 30 permitting leaders, offering a comprehensive look at the hurdles and opportunities in broadband deployment. Natalie Roisman from the Georgetown Law Institute pointed out the diverse expertise that contributed to the paper, underscoring its relevance to both public and private sectors.</p><p>With the broadband industry on the brink of a construction boom, the 'Permitting Success' paper is poised to be an invaluable resource. Gary Bolton of the Fiber Broadband Association remarked on its potential to guide the proper deployment of fiber broadband networks. Beyond infrastructure, the paper's impact is expected to resonate across economic, educational, and social spheres, particularly in rural and suburban communities currently lacking adequate internet access.</p><p>As the U.S. strives for universal broadband connectivity, the strategies outlined in the 'Permitting Success' paper represent a critical step forward. By addressing permitting inefficiencies, the consortium aims to ensure that the vision of a digitally inclusive society becomes a tangible reality, fostering growth and opportunity nationwide.</p>
