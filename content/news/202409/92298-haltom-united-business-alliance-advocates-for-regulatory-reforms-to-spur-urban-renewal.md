<p>The Haltom United Business Alliance (HUBA) is urging city officials to implement code and policy reforms aimed at encouraging urban renewal in Haltom City's older neighborhoods. With public funds unavailable for revitalization, HUBA believes reducing regulatory barriers could make these areas more appealing to private investors and small businesses. The alliance has drawn on research and successful strategies from other cities, including insights from the non-profit Strong Towns, to support their recommendations.</p><p>One of the main obstacles identified by HUBA is the stringent building codes affecting older structures. Joe Palmer, HUBA Communications Director, compared the situation to a historic opera house in Georgia that closed due to expensive upgrade requirements. Similar challenges in Haltom City, such as mandates for sprinkler systems and additional parking, often discourage investment in vacant buildings. Palmer highlighted the lengthy and uncertain approval process as a significant deterrent for potential investors.</p><p>Ron Sturgeon, a founding member of HUBA, shared his own experience of navigating the approval process for a low-cost events center, which took over two years. Sturgeon questioned the feasibility for small businesses to endure such delays, especially as Haltom City's population declines amidst the growth of the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex.</p><p>HUBA is proposing the creation of an overlay district in key areas to simplify the renovation and opening processes for small businesses. Palmer stressed the role of small businesses in urban revitalization and the need for Haltom City to become more competitive by easing investment hurdles. Beyond code reform, HUBA envisions making Haltom City the most small business-friendly city in Tarrant County, a goal they argue is hindered by current zoning and bureaucratic challenges.</p><p>The initiative reflects a wider issue across American cities: balancing regulation with the need for economic growth in aging urban areas. HUBA's approach, inspired by organizations like Strong Towns, offers a potential model for revitalizing urban cores without public funding. The outcome of Haltom City's deliberations may serve as a valuable case study for other municipalities grappling with similar urban development challenges.</p>
