<p>The partnership between BUGAK KIM and Stayfolio marks a significant step in integrating traditional Korean cuisine into the luxury hospitality sector. BUGAK KIM, known for its Kimbugak snack made from a century-old family recipe, will provide its crispy seaweed snacks to guests at select Stayfolio properties, starting with ADAM HANOK near Gyeongbokgung Palace. This initiative not only enhances the guest experience with authentic local flavors but also supports BUGAK KIM's ambitions for international growth.</p><p>Kimbugak's appeal lies in its rich history and modern dietary compatibility. The recipe, passed down through generations of founder Jay Y. Kim's family, is 100% vegan, gluten-free, and sugar-free, catering to a wide range of dietary preferences. This collaboration reflects a broader trend in the hospitality industry towards offering culturally immersive and locally-sourced experiences to travelers.</p><p>The partnership also underscores the potential for traditional foods to thrive in contemporary markets. By introducing Kimbugak to a global audience through luxury accommodations, BUGAK KIM is preserving Korean culinary heritage while exploring new business opportunities. This move could inspire other traditional food producers to seek similar collaborations, potentially leading to a resurgence of heritage recipes adapted for today's consumers.</p><p>As BUGAK KIM prepares for its global debut, the collaboration with Stayfolio serves as a strategic entry point into international markets. The company's plans to expand into supermarkets, restaurants, and hotels worldwide highlight the growing global appetite for authentic and unique food experiences. This partnership not only benefits both companies but also contributes to the cultural exchange and appreciation of Korean cuisine on a global scale.</p>
