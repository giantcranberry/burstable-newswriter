<p>The Justice Collaborative (TJC) has launched a free online background check tool in August 2024, designed to simplify access to public records for individuals across the United States. This initiative arrives as the global background check market is projected to grow from $4.71 billion in 2022 to $6.47 billion by 2028, highlighting the increasing reliance on these services for personal and professional verification.</p><p>TJC's tool stands out for its accessibility and ease of use, offering a no-cost solution to a service that traditionally involves fees or complex processes. It caters to a wide range of needs, from reconnecting with old friends to ensuring safety in online dating, thereby addressing the growing demand for reliable information in the digital age.</p><p>The tool's introduction is timely, as it empowers individuals to make informed decisions about their relationships and associations, potentially improving community safety and transparency. However, TJC cautions users about the legal boundaries of background checks, particularly under the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), advising that the tool is intended for personal use and basic searches.</p><p>This development reflects TJC's mission to make legal information accessible and underscores the importance of balancing transparency with privacy in today's digital landscape. As the background check market expands, TJC's tool sets a new standard for accessibility and user-friendliness in public information services.</p>
