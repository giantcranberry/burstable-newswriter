<p>Bollinger Motors, under the umbrella of Mullen Automotive (NASDAQ: MULN), has reached a pivotal milestone by securing certification from the California Air Resources Board (CARB) for its B4 all-electric, Class 4 low forward chassis truck. This certification is not just a regulatory hurdle cleared but a gateway to expanding Bollinger's market reach into California and 14 other states, including major EV-adopting regions like New York and Massachusetts. The significance of this achievement cannot be overstated, as it not only validates the environmental compliance of the B4 but also opens up substantial financial incentives for potential buyers, with federal and state incentives potentially reaching up to $100,000.</p><p>The CARB certification is a critical step for Bollinger Motors in its mission to electrify commercial fleets across the United States. Bryan Chambers, President and Chief Operating Officer of Bollinger Motors, highlighted the importance of this milestone, emphasizing the company's commitment to delivering sale-ready vehicles that meet both environmental standards and customer expectations. With production set to commence on September 16, 2024, and customer deliveries expected to start the following month, Bollinger is on a clear path to bringing its innovative EV to market.</p><p>This development is also a significant win for Mullen Automotive, showcasing its progress in the commercial EV sector. The company's strategic approach, including the operation of two U.S.-based vehicle plants and recent achievements like IRS approval for federal EV tax credits, positions Mullen as a growing force in the EV manufacturing space. The CARB and EPA certifications for Mullen's ONE and THREE vehicles further underscore the company's dedication to meeting stringent environmental standards across its product lineup.</p><p>The implications of Bollinger's CARB certification extend beyond the immediate benefits to the company and its customers. It represents a broader shift towards sustainable transportation solutions, with commercial fleet operators increasingly looking to reduce their carbon footprint and operating costs. The availability of certified, incentive-eligible electric trucks like the B4 could significantly accelerate this transition, marking a pivotal moment in the evolution of the commercial EV sector.</p><p>For investors and industry observers, Bollinger's achievement is a clear indicator of Mullen Automotive's strategic positioning in the EV landscape. By leveraging its subsidiaries and focusing on a diverse range of vehicle classes, Mullen is carving out a significant presence in the electric commercial vehicle market. As Bollinger Motors moves forward with the production and delivery of its B4 electric trucks, the industry will be watching closely, recognizing the potential impact of this development on the future of sustainable transportation.</p>
