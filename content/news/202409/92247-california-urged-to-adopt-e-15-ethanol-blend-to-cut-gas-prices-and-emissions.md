<p>Aemetis, Inc., a renewable fuels producer based in California, is calling on the California Air Resources Board (CARB) to introduce a 15% ethanol blend (E-15) in gasoline. This initiative could lead to lower gas prices for consumers and a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles. California stands as the sole U.S. state yet to adopt the E-15 blend, despite its approval by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) over a decade ago.</p><p>The proposal aligns with Governor Newsom's special legislative session aimed at tackling the state's high fuel prices. Research from UC Berkeley and the US Naval Academy indicates that E-15 could save California drivers $2.7 billion annually, equating to about $0.20 per gallon. For an average household, this could mean $200 in yearly savings on gasoline.</p><p>Environmental advantages accompany the economic benefits. Ethanol, sourced from renewables, produces 46% fewer air pollutants than traditional gasoline. This reduction supports California's objective of achieving net carbon neutrality by 2045. A study commissioned by CARB highlights E-15's potential to decrease emissions of harmful pollutants, improving air quality and public health.</p><p>Eric McAfee, Aemetis, Inc.'s Chairman and CEO, underscores the urgency of adopting E-15. He views it as a critical, immediate measure to cut fossil fuel emissions while the transition to electric vehicles progresses. McAfee points out that the groundwork for E-15 implementation, including necessary testing, is complete, with billions of miles already driven on E-15 across the U.S. since its 2011 approval.</p><p>CARB possesses the capability to enact regulations permitting E-15 sales in California by 2025. Such a decision could swiftly alleviate high gas prices and contribute to environmental conservation efforts. Given that the transportation sector is responsible for 27% of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions, increasing the ethanol blend in California could markedly reduce both emissions and gasoline consumption.</p><p>The push for E-15 adoption in California offers a dual solution to economic and environmental challenges. It represents a viable interim strategy as the state advances towards its long-term zero-emission vehicle goals. With the state legislature's special session ongoing, the E-15 proposal emerges as a practical step towards immediate consumer relief and environmental progress. The outcome of these discussions could soon determine California's stance on this renewable fuel option.</p>
