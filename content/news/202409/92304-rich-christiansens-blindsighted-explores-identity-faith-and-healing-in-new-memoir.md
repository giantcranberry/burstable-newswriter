<p>Rich Christiansen, a USA Today Best-Selling Author, is preparing to release his new book, 'BlindSighted: A Journey of Identity, Faith, and Healing,' on October 14th. This memoir offers a deep dive into Christiansen's life-altering discovery at the age of 53, when a DNA test revealed unexpected truths about his parentage, challenging his understanding of family, identity, and faith.</p><p>The book narrates Christiansen's journey of reconciling these revelations with his upbringing in Utah's Mormon community and his relationship with John Christiansen, the man who raised him, despite not being his biological father. 'BlindSighted' explores themes of sacrifice, love, and the essence of family beyond genetic connections, providing readers with insights into the complexities of human relationships and personal identity.</p><p>Christiansen's entrepreneurial background enriches the narrative, blending personal anecdotes with advice on financial security and adopting an opportunistic mindset. The memoir also addresses the sensitive topic of deciding to have children with potential genetic conditions, presenting it as a deeply personal choice influenced by love and fear.</p><p>Accompanying the book's release are two significant events: a discussion with First Lady of Utah Abby Cox at The King's English bookstore in Salt Lake City on October 14th, and an appearance with Joe Polish, founder of Genius Network, at the Changing Hands bookstore in Tempe, Arizona, on October 18th.</p><p>'BlindSighted' is expected to resonate with readers facing their own questions about identity, family dynamics, and personal growth. Christiansen's story is a powerful reminder of the strength of family bonds and the capacity for healing and understanding in the face of life's unexpected challenges.</p>
