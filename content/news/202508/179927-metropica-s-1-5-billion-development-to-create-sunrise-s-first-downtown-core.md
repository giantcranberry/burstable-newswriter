<p>Metropica Development LLC is advancing a transformative $1.5 billion mixed-use project in Sunrise, Florida, that will establish the city's first true downtown center on a 50-acre site between Sawgrass Mills and Amerant Bank Arena. The development, approved for 3,000 residential units, 650,000 square feet of office space, 485,000 square feet of retail, and two hotels, represents one of the largest private investments in western Broward County's history.</p><p>According to CEO Joseph Kavana, Metropica was conceived as a "dream community" where residents can live, work, and play without extensive travel requirements. The project's next phase includes 1,000 luxury rental apartments, a retail plaza with restaurants and entertainment, and one of the two planned hotels. This development aims to create an urban core for a city that has primarily featured suburban development patterns until now.</p><p>The project incorporates three guiding principles: Nature, Wellness, and Happiness, which have been integrated through extensive green spaces and premium amenities including a state-of-the-art gym facility. The design collaboration involves internationally renowned architect Chad Oppenheim and London-based YOO Design Group, founded by John Hitchcox and Philippe Starck, who previously worked on the completed One Metropica condominium tower that is nearly sold out.</p><p>A critical infrastructure component involves a recent landmark agreement where Metropica Development donated 19 acres of land to the Florida Turnpike Authority through a memorandum with the city. This donation, which required significant changes to the project's stormwater retention plan, will enable the Florida Department of Transportation to create a full access interchange at Pat Salerno Drive and the Sawgrass Expressway (State Road 869). The improved highway access is expected to dramatically simplify traffic flow, particularly for events at the Amerant Bank Arena, home of the two-time defending Stanley Cup champion Florida Panthers.</p><p>The development positions itself as complementary to other major investments in the area, including the new Baptist hospital, American Express campus, and Florida Panthers' development projects. When fully operational, Metropica is projected to host 16,000 to 18,000 people daily, solidifying western Sunrise as a rapidly growing urban neighborhood with enhanced connectivity and community gathering spaces.</p>
