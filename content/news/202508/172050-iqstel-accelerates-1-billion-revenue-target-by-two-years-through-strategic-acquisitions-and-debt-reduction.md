<p>IQSTEL Inc. (NASDAQ: IQST) is rapidly approaching its ambitious $1 billion revenue goal, with company leadership indicating they are two years ahead of their original 2027 target. The multinational telecommunications and technology company, which serves 600 of the world's largest telecom companies, has built its growth strategy around both organic expansion and strategic acquisitions.</p><p>Chief Financial Officer Alvaro Quintana Cardona emphasized the company's acquisition philosophy during a recent interview, stating that IQSTEL seeks companies that add shareholder value and possess strong, growable revenue streams. Through all of our acquisitions, we have been increasing the value of the company. We have a stronger balance sheet with every acquisition, Cardona explained. The company has completed twelve acquisitions since its inception in 2018, building a diversified platform across telecommunications, fintech, and cybersecurity sectors.</p><p>Beyond acquisition-driven growth, IQSTEL has been streamlining its operations and strengthening its financial position. The company recently reduced its debt by $6.9 million, equivalent to approximately $2 per share. More than half of this debt reduction came through conversion into preferred shares, which Cardona described as evidence of the company's long-term strategic vision.</p><p>CEO Leandro Iglesias highlighted that the company is achieving this accelerated growth without increasing operational expenses proportionally. When IQSTEL reaches the $1 billion revenue milestone, Iglesias projects the company will achieve EBITDA between $20 million and $30 million. Despite this progress, Iglesias noted that the company's valuation hasn't yet reflected these improvements, creating what he described as a significant valuation gap compared to sector peers trading at 10X to 20X EBITDA multiples.</p><p>The company's diverse business portfolio across high-growth technology sectors, combined with its disciplined acquisition strategy and operational efficiency, positions IQSTEL for potential substantial valuation growth as it closes in on its revenue target ahead of schedule.
