<p>Trumark Homes, a leading homebuilder in the Western U.S., has recently announced the complete sellout of three of its Northern California communities: Summit Collection in Castro Valley, Penny Lane in Concord, and Jasper in Morgan Hill. This milestone reflects the robust demand for a variety of housing types in the area, catering to different lifestyles and preferences.</p><p>The Summit Collection, launched in August 2024, comprises 25 single-family estate-style homes situated on nearly one-acre lots. These homes not only offer stunning views but also provide access to hiking trails and open spaces, enhancing the living experience. The community's appeal is further bolstered by Castro Valley's rich ranching heritage, including the notable Rowell Ranch Rodeo.</p><p>Penny Lane, which opened its doors in September 2022, features 70 three-story townhomes in Concord. Known for its high happiness ranking and family-friendly atmosphere, Concord offers excellent schools and a plethora of youth activities, making Penny Lane an attractive option for families.</p><p>Jasper, introduced in February 2022, consists of 101 townhomes in Morgan Hill. The community is prized for its safety and its proximity to Silicon Valley, offering residents easy access to the tech industry's bustling hubs.</p><p>Tony Bosowski, Northern California Division President for Trumark Homes, commented on the significance of these sellouts, noting, 'The popularity of these communities reflects the ongoing desire for well-designed homes across Northern California.' With plans to launch 11 new communities in the region this year, including Francis Ranch and Parkton in Dublin, and Arroyo Crossings in Livermore, Trumark Homes is set to continue its expansion.
