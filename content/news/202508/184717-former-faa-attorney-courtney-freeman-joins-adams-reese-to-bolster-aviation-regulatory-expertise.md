<p>Courtney W. Freeman, a former Federal Aviation Administration regulations attorney with extensive experience in emerging aviation technologies, has joined law firm Adams & Reese as Counsel. Freeman spent over a decade in the FAA's Office of the Chief Counsel, where she led legal teams responsible for developing regulatory frameworks for cutting-edge aviation innovations.</p><p>Her work at the FAA focused on Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS), Beyond Visual Line of Sight drone operations, and Advanced Air Mobility technologies including powered lift aircraft capable of vertical takeoff and landing. Freeman led the teams that provided the legal architecture for these technologies, including implementation of the recent Executive Order <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2023/10/25/unleashing-american-drone-dominance/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">"Unleashing American Drone Dominance"</a>.</p><p>Marc Warren, Co-Leader of the Adams & Reese Aviation & Aerospace Team and former FAA acting chief counsel, emphasized Freeman's unique qualifications. "Courtney has been instrumental in developing and supporting many of the regulatory frameworks for the FAA's most forward-looking programs," Warren stated. "She has a deep understanding of the federal policy-making and rule-making processes and keen insight into implementation challenges including waivers, exemptions, compliance, and enforcement."</p><p>Freeman's expertise extends beyond emerging technologies to traditional air carrier operations, hazardous materials carriage requirements, pandemic response protocols, environmental compliance, privacy matters, and Paperwork Reduction Act compliance. Her team frequently handled issues of agency first impression, with Freeman personally dispositioning the most complicated legal matters.</p><p>The addition of Freeman strengthens Adams & Reese's Aviation & Aerospace Team within its Intersection of Business & Government Practice Group. The team includes other industry heavyweights with extensive government and corporate experience, creating what firm leadership describes as a "go-to international aviation and aerospace practice for mission-critical matters."</p><p>Paul Alp, Aviation & Aerospace Team Co-Leader and former senior counsel at The Boeing Company, noted that "Courtney brings substantial knowledge of the regulatory environment and challenges facing emerging air transportation systems. Her experience and connections will be invaluable to our clients as these technologies become ever more sophisticated and common."</p><p>Freeman's move from government service to private practice reflects the growing legal complexity surrounding advanced aviation technologies and the increasing demand for attorneys who understand both regulatory development and practical implementation challenges. This development signals the maturation of the advanced air mobility sector and the critical need for legal expertise that can bridge the gap between innovation and regulatory compliance.</p>
