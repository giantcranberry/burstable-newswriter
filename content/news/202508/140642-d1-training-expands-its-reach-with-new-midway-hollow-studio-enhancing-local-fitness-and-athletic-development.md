<p>The introduction of a new D1 Training studio in Midway Hollow represents a significant milestone for the local fitness and athletic training scene. Spearheaded by Kendrick and Aron Leckband, this facility is set to open on August 9, offering a comprehensive, sports-science backed training regimen tailored for individuals across various age groups. Located at 10031 Marsh Ln #320, the studio is a testament to the Leckbands' dedication to promoting athletic excellence and confidence within the Park Cities, Preston Hollow, and Midway Hollow communities.</p><p>D1 Training's approach is built on five fundamental principles of athletic-based training: dynamic warm-up, performance, strength program, core and conditioning, and cool down. The studio is designed to cater to a wide demographic, with specialized programs for rookies (ages 7-11), developmental athletes (ages 12-14), prep athletes (ages 15-18), and adults. The availability of group, semi-private, and one-on-one training sessions with certified coaches ensures that each participant receives personalized guidance tailored to their fitness or sport objectives.</p><p>The Leckbands' initiative is deeply rooted in their personal connection to athletics and their experience as parents of four active children. Recognizing the need for a facility that supports athletic development in their community, they have aligned their vision with D1 Training's mission to empower individuals through fitness, irrespective of their athletic background. This new studio is expected to serve as a central hub for community members aiming to improve their physical capabilities and reach their personal best.</p><p>Dan Murphy, D1 Training's Chief Operating Officer, has expressed his excitement about the Leckbands joining the franchise, noting their potential to significantly impact the local community with the unique D1 Training experience. With over 100 locations across the country and more in the pipeline, D1 Training is broadening its influence, offering franchise opportunities to those eager to make a difference through fitness and youth sports.</p><p>The transition of members from the recently closed D1 Training Dallas to the new Midway Hollow location, managed by Kevin Engelbrecht, ensures a smooth continuation of fitness journeys for many. This expansion is not just a business venture for the Leckbands but a meaningful endeavor to contribute to the athletic and personal growth of their community members.
