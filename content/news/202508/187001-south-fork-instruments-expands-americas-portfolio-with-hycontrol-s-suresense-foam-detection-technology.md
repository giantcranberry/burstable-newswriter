<p>South Fork Instruments has announced the addition of Hycontrol's SureSense+ foam detection and control system to its product portfolio across the Americas, addressing persistent challenges in food processing operations. Foam remains unpredictable and difficult to monitor, leading many plants to rely on fixed chemical dosing or liquid-level probes that perform poorly in foaming conditions, resulting in higher antifoam chemical use, inconsistent control, and unexpected process interruptions.</p><p>The SureSense+ system from Hycontrol was developed specifically to overcome these limitations. Unlike repurposed liquid-level sensors, it utilizes IMA (Intelligent Multi-Action) sensing technology to distinguish true foam from probe fouling, delivering accurate and repeatable measurement even in high-foam or heavily contaminated environments. Key technical features include detection of foam and foam-liquid interfaces, reliable operation under heavy fouling conditions, fully configurable control outputs for dosing systems, and compatibility with a wide range of food, chemical, and industrial processes.</p><p>John Daly, Technical Director at South Fork Instruments, explained the significance of this technology: "Foam detection has always been a difficult variable to monitor accurately. Hycontrol's SureSense+ system solves this by using probes designed specifically for foam, rather than misapplying liquid level sensors for the job. That distinction makes it possible to dose antifoam precisely when it's required, cutting waste and improving process stability."</p><p>South Fork Instruments now supplies and supports SureSense+ systems across the Americas, providing configuration and integration expertise to ensure reliable operation in demanding process environments.
