<p>UGI Utilities, Inc. has initiated a natural gas main replacement project in Nazareth, starting August 11, as part of its commitment to maintaining the safety and reliability of its natural gas services. This project, anticipated to finish by the end of October, will not only modernize the existing infrastructure but also enable certain residences and businesses along the project's route to transition to natural gas.</p><p>The construction will impact several major streets in Nazareth, such as South Church Street, Mauch Chunk Street, Belvidere Street, Progress Avenue, South Green Street, and South Spruce Street. Scheduled work hours from 7:00am to 5:00pm, Monday through Friday, may lead to road closures, detours, and traffic delays. Additionally, parking restrictions and temporary natural gas service interruptions are expected, requiring UGI to access properties for equipment inspection and relighting purposes.</p><p>UGI has noted that the project's timeline could be affected by weather and working conditions. After the underground work is completed, final paving and restoration activities are set to take place at a later date. For individuals interested in converting to natural gas, UGI has made resources and further details about the project and its services available on its website, <a href='https://www.ugi.com' rel='nofollow' target='_blank'>www.ugi.com</a>.</p><p>This initiative is a pivotal part of UGI's broader strategy to upgrade its infrastructure and cater to the increasing demand for dependable and efficient energy solutions in the Nazareth region. The enhancements are projected to markedly boost the performance of the natural gas distribution system, offering advantages to both existing and prospective new customers.</p>
