<p>Qualys, Inc., a leader in cloud-based IT, security, and compliance solutions, has unveiled its latest innovation, Agentic AI capabilities, setting a new standard in autonomous risk management. This groundbreaking technology introduces a marketplace of Cyber Risk AI Agents, designed to deliver real-time risk insights across all attack surfaces, prioritized by their potential impact on businesses. The integration of Agentic AI into the Qualys platform is poised to transform cybersecurity operations by eliminating manual bottlenecks, allowing teams to dedicate their efforts to strategic decision-making rather than repetitive tasks.</p><p>The increasing volume and sophistication of cyber threats have placed unprecedented pressure on security teams, complicating the prioritization and remediation of risks. Qualys tackles these challenges head-on by embedding Agentic AI into its Enterprise TruRisk Management (ETM), thereby enhancing risk-centric automation capabilities. This advancement not only speeds up the process of risk reduction but also enhances the precision of recommended actions, empowering security teams to evolve from tactical responders to strategic orchestrators of agentic AI.</p><p>Key features of the new AI fabric include pre-built AI agents that automate the prioritization of threats and the formulation of remediation strategies, customized to align with each organization's risk tolerance. The Cyber Risk Assistant, a prompt-driven interface, simplifies the navigation of the risk landscape by converting millions of exposures into actionable insights. Furthermore, the platform introduces Adaptive Risk Remediation AI Agents, like the Microsoft Patch Tuesday Lifecycle Agent, which dramatically decreases the mean time to remediation (MTTR) by proactively identifying and mitigating vulnerabilities.</p><p>Security teams are also afforded the flexibility to develop custom, no-code, pretrained AI agents for specialized tasks, facilitating scalable and repeatable automation for unique risk management workflows. Sumedh Thakar, president and CEO of Qualys, emphasizes that this innovation heralds a new era where Chief Information Security Officers (CISOs) can enhance their teams with intelligent AI agents for more rapid and strategic risk reduction.</p><p>The Agentic AI features are currently available in preview at Black Hat U.S., with additional details accessible at <a href='https://qualys.com/agentic-ai-preview' rel='nofollow' target='_blank'>qualys.com/agentic-ai-preview</a>.
