<p>Beeline Holdings, Inc. has expanded its proprietary AI agent Bob from customer support into sales and origination activities following strong second-quarter pilot results. The digital mortgage platform's artificial intelligence system, introduced in 2023, has demonstrated remarkable effectiveness in borrower engagement and lead generation.</p><p>According to company data, Bob has delivered borrower engagement six times more effective than human loan officers while generating 2.5 times more leads at near-zero cost. The AI agent's performance during the Q2 2025 pilot produced $7.1 million in origination volume and $170,000 in revenue, with more than half of borrower interactions occurring outside normal business hours.</p><p>CEO Nick Liuzza stated that Bob is evolving into an expert on-brand communicator capable of driving loan production at lower cost. The expansion represents a significant shift in how mortgage companies leverage artificial intelligence to streamline operations and improve customer accessibility. The technology's ability to engage borrowers during non-traditional hours addresses a key limitation of conventional mortgage services.</p><p>Beeline Holdings plans to further expand Bob's capabilities into borrower education, top-of-funnel sales, and eventually processing and underwriting by 2026. The company's technology-forward approach combines AI, automation, and modern user experience design to simplify home financing for a new generation of buyers. Additional information about the company is available at <a href="https://ibn.fm/BLNE" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://ibn.fm/BLNE</a>.</p><p>The successful implementation of AI in mortgage origination highlights the growing trend of artificial intelligence transforming traditional financial services. Beeline's results demonstrate how AI agents can not only reduce operational costs but also expand service availability and improve conversion rates in the competitive mortgage industry.</p>
