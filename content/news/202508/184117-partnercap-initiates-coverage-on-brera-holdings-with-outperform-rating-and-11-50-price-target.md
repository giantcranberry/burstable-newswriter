<p>PartnerCap Securities has initiated coverage on Brera Holdings PLC (NASDAQ: BREA) with an Outperform rating and an $11.50 price target, according to a new research report titled "Kicking off a Global Value Play: Early Entry into the World's First Public MCO Platform." The report emphasizes Brera's pioneering multi-club ownership model in global football, citing favorable industry trends, improving financial performance, and strong management alignment as key factors supporting the positive outlook.</p><p>Currently trading at approximately 1.0x FY2026 enterprise value to revenue compared to peer multiples of around 2.7x, Brera's valuation is considered undervalued relative to its growth potential. The $11.50 price target is supported by FY2026 revenue estimates of $15.2 million, which the analysts believe does not fully account for growth from both existing operations and future acquisitions. The full research report is available at <a href="https://ibn.fm/QDj1v" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://ibn.fm/QDj1v</a>.</p><p>Brera Holdings has been strategically expanding its football portfolio through acquisitions and investments across multiple continents. The company acquired Brera FC in 2022, known as "The Third Team of Milan," which has been building an alternative football legacy since 2000. The club also organizes the FENIX Trophy, a nonprofessional pan-European tournament recognized by UEFA and described by BBC Sport as "the Champions League for Amateurs."</p><p>The company's expansion strategy includes establishing Brera Tchumene FC in Mozambique, which rapidly advanced to the First Division, and acquiring a 90% stake in North Macedonian first-division team Fudbalski Klub Akademija Pandev, now Brera Strumica FC. In June 2023, Brera made a strategic investment in Manchester United PLC, realizing a 74% gain. Additional acquisitions include control of Bayanzurkh Sporting Ilch FC in Mongolia and establishment of Brera Tiverija FC, a women's football club in North Macedonia.</p><p>The most significant development came on December 31, 2024, when Brera executed an agreement to acquire a majority stake in SS Juve Stabia srl, the company managing Italian Serie B football club Juve Stabia, known as "The Other Team of Naples." The acquisition of 52% majority control was completed on June 20, 2025, following a multi-step process that represents a major expansion of Brera's multi-club ownership model. More information about the company is available at <a href="https://www.breraholdings.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.breraholdings.com</a>.</p><p>With a strategic focus on bottom-up value creation, innovation-driven growth, and socially impactful outcomes, Brera Holdings has positioned itself as a forward-thinking leader in the global sports industry. The company's unique approach to football club ownership and management, combined with its expanding international portfolio, provides a distinctive investment opportunity in the growing sports management sector.</p>
