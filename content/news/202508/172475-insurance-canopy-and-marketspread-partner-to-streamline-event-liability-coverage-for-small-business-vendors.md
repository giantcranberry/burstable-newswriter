<p>Insurance Canopy has partnered with Marketspread to provide streamlined event liability insurance for small business vendors and exhibitors through an integrated digital platform. The collaboration enables Marketspread users across nine industries to purchase insurance directly online without agent involvement, offering coverage specifically designed for often-overlooked niche categories including artisans, farmers' market vendors, food vendors, entertainers, photographers, and liquor vendors.</p><p>The integration addresses significant pain points for small business owners who typically face lengthy insurance processes through traditional providers. Vendors can now secure quotes within 8-10 minutes and download proof of insurance instantly through the Marketspread platform during event registration. The program offers competitively priced policies that are tailored to the unique needs of event-based businesses, providing comprehensive protection that has historically been difficult to access for specialized vendor categories.</p><p>Daryle Stafford, CEO of Insurance Canopy, emphasized the partnership's alignment with the company's mission to serve niche industries underserved by traditional insurance providers. The partnership reflects Insurance Canopy's broader offering of over 200 unique policy types for small businesses, ranging from event vendor coverage to specialized insurance for fitness instructors, beauty professionals, and ecommerce sellers.</p><p>Marketspread Co-Founder Daniel Westervelt noted that insurance has been a frequently overlooked component in vendor preparedness. The integration represents a significant step in supporting small business vendors who participate in events through platforms like Marketspread's event management system, ensuring they can operate with proper protection while minimizing administrative burdens.</p><p>This partnership demonstrates the growing importance of digital insurance solutions that meet small businesses where they operate, providing essential protection without the traditional barriers of agent-mediated processes. The collaboration between a specialized insurance provider and a major event management platform creates a seamless experience for vendors who previously struggled to obtain appropriate coverage, ultimately strengthening the foundation of local events and markets that depend on small business participation.</p>
