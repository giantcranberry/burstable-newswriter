<p>The Kuala Lumpur data center colocation market is projected to reach USD $300 million in 2025 and grow to $1.1 billion by 2030, representing a five-year compound annual growth rate of 31%. This explosive growth is driven by hyperscale cloud expansion, AI infrastructure development, and Kuala Lumpur's strategic positioning near Singapore and Johor. Hyperscale cloud providers including Alibaba Cloud, AWS, Microsoft, and Google are expanding their presence through a mix of colocation, built-to-suit, and self-build strategies.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Jakarta data center colocation market is projected to be worth USD $507.2 million in 2025 and expected to grow at a five-year CAGR of 11% through 2030, reaching $856 million. Over 65MW of hyperscale colocation inventory is expected to come online in 2025, with overall capacity projected to double by 2030. The market continues to grow steadily with Chinese cloud platforms resuming CapEx investment and AI-native providers entering the region.</p><p>According to Philbert Shih, Managing Director of Structure Research, "Southeast Asia is entering a transformative phase of infrastructure buildout, and both Kuala Lumpur and Jakarta are becoming central to the next wave of growth. Hyperscale and AI infrastructure platforms are reshaping deployment models, and these markets are well-positioned to support new demand patterns, regional redundancy, and diverse workloads."</p><p>Both reports provide detailed data on market size, hyperscale leasing, self-build capacity, interconnection, and geographic clustering. The comprehensive studies are available through <a href="https://structureresearch.net/reports/kuala-lumpur-dcai-report-2025" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Kuala Lumpur DCAI Report 2025</a> and <a href="https://structureresearch.net/reports/jakarta-dci-report-2025" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Jakarta DCI Report 2025</a>, offering investors, operators, and stakeholders critical insights to guide expansion strategies in Southeast Asia.</p><p>Structure Research also announced an upcoming Bangkok 2025 report to be released in Q4, building on their 2024 findings that valued the Bangkok market at approximately USD $165 million with expectations to reach $540 million by 2029. The rapid growth across these Southeast Asian markets underscores the region's emergence as a critical hub for digital infrastructure supporting the global expansion of cloud computing and artificial intelligence technologies.</p>
