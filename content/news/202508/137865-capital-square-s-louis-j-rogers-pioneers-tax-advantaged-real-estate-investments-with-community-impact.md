<p>Louis J. Rogers, the founder and co-chief executive officer of Capital Square, has emerged as a pivotal figure in the real estate investment sector, specializing in tax-advantaged real estate investments. His expertise in Section 1031 exchanges and Opportunity Zones has enabled the creation of a vertically integrated operation that includes Delaware Statutory Trusts (DSTs), Opportunity Zone developments, build-for-rent, and REIT offerings. This strategic focus has not only offered investors substantial tax benefits but also spurred the development of multifamily communities in key markets.</p><p>Under Rogers' guidance, Capital Square has managed nearly $8 billion in assets, structuring over $4 billion in DST, TIC, and REIT offerings. A notable achievement is the launch of nine Opportunity Zone funds aimed at developing nearly 2,000 multifamily units across several states, with projects valued at approximately $800 million. These initiatives are designed to rejuvenate communities while providing investors with tax deferral and potential exclusion benefits. The <a href='https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/opportunity-zones-frequently-asked-questions' rel='nofollow' target='_blank'>Opportunity Zones program</a> has been a focal point for Rogers, who has played an active role in policy discussions to influence its direction.</p><p>Capital Square's recent projects, including luxury multi-use high-rises and upscale modular neighborhoods, target households excluded from traditional homeownership, addressing the urgent need for affordable housing. For example, the Livano Knoxville project is anticipated to create over 600 construction jobs and generate nearly $3 million in construction-phase tax revenue, showcasing the dual benefits of financial returns and community development.</p><p>Rogers' innovative approach is further highlighted by the introduction of the Capital Square Housing Trust (REIT), enabling DST investors to benefit from lasting tax-deferral advantages. This initiative underscores Rogers' vision of merging financial success with societal contributions, a philosophy that has defined Capital Square's operations. His contributions extend beyond business, as evidenced by his authorship of <a href='https://www.amazon.com/How-Swap-Till-You-Drop/dp/099899730X' rel='nofollow' target='_blank'>How to Swap Till You Drop</a>, a resource that simplifies complex real estate tax strategies, reinforcing his status as a leading authority in the field.</p><p>Through Rogers' leadership, Capital Square has not only experienced exponential growth but has also established new benchmarks for integrating tax-advantaged investments with impactful community development, setting a precedent for the industry at large.</p>
