<p>The personal protective equipment (PPE) industry has historically overlooked the needs of women, offering gear primarily designed for men, which often results in ill-fitting and unsafe options for women in construction, healthcare, and other fields. ARX, co-founded by Kaitlin McCarthy and Dr. Hilary Galin, is addressing this gap by creating PPE that is tailored to women's bodies and workflows, marking a significant shift in the industry.</p><p>McCarthy's background in real estate development and engineering, combined with Galin's expertise in medicine, engineering, and business, positioned them uniquely to identify and tackle the shortcomings in women's PPE. Their brand, ARX, stands out by not merely scaling down men's gear but by rethinking design from the ground up to ensure safety, comfort, and functionality for women. This innovative approach has been met with enthusiasm from women across various sectors, who have long struggled with inadequate PPE.</p><p>The launch of ARX comes at a pivotal time, as recent Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regulations highlight the critical importance of properly fitting PPE. This, along with cultural shifts and the increasing presence of women in traditionally male-dominated fields, presents a ripe opportunity for ARX to lead change. Beyond expanding its product line, ARX is engaging with institutions and employers to advocate for policy changes, aiming to influence the industry at a systemic level.</p><p>For more insights into ARX's mission to revolutionize PPE for women, visit <a href='https://www.arx.com' rel='nofollow' target='_blank'>https://www.arx.com</a>.
