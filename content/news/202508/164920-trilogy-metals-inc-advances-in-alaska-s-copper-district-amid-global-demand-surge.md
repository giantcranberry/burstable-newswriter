Focused on the Arctic and Bornite deposits, Trilogy's development efforts are bolstered by collaborative exploration agreements with local Alaska Native Corporations, reflecting a commitment to responsible and inclusive resource development.</p><p>The Ambler Mining District's rich copper-dominant deposits underscore its critical role in the global copper supply chain.
