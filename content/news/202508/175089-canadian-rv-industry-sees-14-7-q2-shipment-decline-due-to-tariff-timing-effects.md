<p>The Canadian Recreational Vehicle Association reported a 14.7% decrease in RV wholesale shipments to Canada for the second quarter of 2025, with 7,867 units compared to 9,221 units in the same period last year. Despite this quarterly decline, year-to-date shipments showed a 3.2% increase, reaching 17,852 units through June 30.</p><p>According to Statistical Surveys data via theRVDA of Canada, retail sales remained strong at 13,129 units in the quarter, leading to significant inventory drawdowns at dealerships, particularly in the motorized segment. The quarterly decline was primarily driven by order timing effects, as many Canadian dealers pulled forward Q1 orders to anticipate proposed countermeasure tariffs announced by the federal government.</p><p>Canada's counter-tariffs on motorhomes were in effect from April through June, disproportionately affecting motorized shipments and contributing to the year-over-year decline in that segment. These countermeasures have since been lifted, and Canada currently applies no tariffs on RVs imported from the United States.</p><p>Shane Devenish, President of CRVA, stated that the data indicates Canadian consumers remain engaged, but Q2 performance was shaped by policy timing rather than demand fundamentals. The association reiterated its call for tariff-free, reciprocal trade across North America, emphasizing that current U.S. tariff policies on Canadian-built units create uncertainty and unfair disadvantages for Canadian manufacturers exporting south of the border.</p><p>The RV industry represents a significant economic force in Canada, contributing $16.1 billion to the country's GDP and employing 141,000 Canadians according to a 2023 impact study. RVing supports campgrounds, dealers, service technicians, suppliers, and tourism businesses in every province and territory, with over 2.1 million Canadian households owning an RV.</p><p>The affordability of RV travel—often costing up to 50% less than traditional fly-and-stay vacations—combined with growing domestic tourism trends, positions the industry as a vital component of Canada's outdoor economy and tourism sector. Nearly two-thirds of Canadian vacationers plan to stay within the country, with an increasing number choosing RVs as their preferred travel method.</p>
