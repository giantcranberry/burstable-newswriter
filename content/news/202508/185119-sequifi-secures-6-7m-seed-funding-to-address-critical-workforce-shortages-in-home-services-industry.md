<p>Sequifi, a workforce infrastructure platform for the home services industry, has secured $6.7 million in seed funding led by <a href="https://www.cervinventures.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Cervin Ventures</a> to accelerate product development and expand into new market segments. The funding addresses what CEO Roshan Kumar describes as one of the nation's most pressing workforce challenges: retaining skilled tradespeople amid projected shortages of 2.1 million workers by 2030.</p><p>The urgency stems from the projected growth of the U.S. home services market to $156 billion by 2030, coupled with increasing demand for skilled tradespeople due to AI-driven infrastructure needs. Kumar notes that more than 50% of home service companies struggle to find qualified workers, with turnover rates around 45% primarily due to delayed pay and outdated systems. This workforce gap threatens to cause stalled projects, longer wait times, and higher costs across the industry.</p><p>Sequifi's platform differentiates itself by being purpose-built for field services rather than desk-based work. The system provides same-day payroll, real-time commission tracking, forecasting tools, and HR capabilities designed specifically for crews whose schedules depend on weather, job complexity, and seasonal demand. The platform supports scalability from teams of 100 to 5,000+ workers without extensive onboarding periods.</p><p>Early adopters have demonstrated significant improvements. Solar installation company Aveyo transitioned from weeks-long payment delays to same-day pay for installers, resulting in dramatically improved retention. Pest control company Source MRKTG reduced payroll processing time by 75%, eliminated pay disputes, and saw technicians advancing into leadership roles due to increased trust in the system.</p><p>Kumar emphasizes that the company's approach is rooted in lived experience, having worked as installers and crew leads before developing the software. This firsthand understanding of field service challenges informs product development and resonates with industry users. The new funding will enable expansion into adjacent markets including mortgage and fiber services, while enhancing automation and forecasting capabilities.</p><p>For business leaders hesitant to modernize, Kumar warns that continued reliance on spreadsheet-based payroll systems risks losing workers, revenue, and reputation. He positions modern workforce tools as essential for survival rather than optional upgrades, noting that companies embracing these solutions now will be best positioned for success in the evolving market landscape.</p>
