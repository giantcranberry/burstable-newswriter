The auto-approval rate has improved to 80%, a testament to the advancements in automation and risk stratification facilitated by OppFi’s Model 6 platform. Credit quality has also seen notable enhancements, with the net charge-off rate decreasing to 31.9% of total revenue, down from the previous year, and the portfolio yield achieving a company record of 136%.</p><p>In response to these achievements, OppFi has revised its full-year 2025 revenue guidance upwards to $578–$605 million and adjusted net income guidance to $125–$130 million. The adjusted EPS guidance has also been increased to $1.39–$1.44, based on an anticipated 90 million diluted shares.
