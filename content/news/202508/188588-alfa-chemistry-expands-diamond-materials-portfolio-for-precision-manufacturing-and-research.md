<p>Alfa Chemistry has expanded its product line with advanced diamond materials designed to support precision manufacturing and research applications requiring sub-micron surface control. The new portfolio includes diamond micron powder, nanodiamond powder, and diamond lapping products specifically engineered for semiconductor production, optical engineering, aerospace components, and biomedical research.</p><p>The micron-sized powders are available in polycrystalline, monocrystalline, and specialized formulations with particle sizes ranging from 1 to 50 Î¼m. These materials enable precise control over abrasive removal rates and surface finish, which is critical for polishing semiconductor wafers and planarizing optical lenses where surface roughness must remain within nanoscale tolerances. According to a Senior Scientist of Material Chemistry at Alfa Chemistry, maintaining surface precision below a micron while controlling coating uniformity represents a significant challenge in both research and industrial settings.</p><p>Nanodiamond powders feature narrow particle size distributions, high surface functionalization capacity, and controlled dispersion properties to prevent agglomeration. These characteristics make them essential for ultrafine polishing, thin-film coatings, and surface modification of biomedical devices and high-performance composites. The materials are designed to perform consistently under specific process conditions, allowing engineers and researchers to achieve desired surface roughness, planarization rates, and coating thickness without extensive trial-and-error adjustments.</p><p>Lapping products including slurries, pastes, and gels utilize various organic and aqueous carriers to maintain consistent viscosity, chemical compatibility, and dispersion stability. This adaptability enables customization for different polishing techniques and substrates, providing exact control over material removal rates and surface smoothness. The customizable formulations help laboratories achieve reproducible results across diverse surfaces including glass, metals, and polymers.</p><p>The diamond materials portfolio supports high-precision workflows and repeatable experimental settings by matching material properties with specific processing requirements. Controlled micron powders enable precise wafer planarization in semiconductor manufacturing, while nanodiamond dispersions enhance thin-film homogeneity for optical and medical applications.
