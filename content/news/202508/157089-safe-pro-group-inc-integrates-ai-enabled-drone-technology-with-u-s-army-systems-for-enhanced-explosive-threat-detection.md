<p>Safe Pro Group Inc. (NASDAQ: SPAI) has reached a pivotal milestone by integrating its AI-enabled drone technology with the U.S. Army's systems, significantly improving the military's ability to detect explosive threats in real time. This collaboration utilizes Safe Pro's advanced computer vision software, capable of identifying over 150 types of explosive devices, including landmines and unexploded ordnance, with remarkable accuracy. The technology's efficacy was demonstrated in Ukraine, where it analyzed more than 1.78 million drone images and detected 31,600 threats, highlighting its life-saving potential in conflict zones.</p><p>The SPOTD (Safe Pro Object Threat Detection) technology is engineered for the swift identification and mapping of explosive threats, aiding in convoy protection, route planning, and enhancing situational awareness. A <a href='https://ibn.fm/iUNUG' rel='nofollow' target='_blank'>demonstration video</a> showcases the AI's ability to detect threats as minuscule as a soda can in less than a second per image. Compatible with commercially available drones, this drone-agnostic software presents a cost-efficient solution for intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) missions.</p><p>Beyond military use, Safe Pro's technology offers significant benefits for humanitarian and commercial demining efforts. Its capability to produce interactive 3D threat maps from drone imagery, along with GPS-tagged geospatial data, overcomes obstacles in areas where manual detection is compromised by terrain complexity or poor visibility. This is especially advantageous for NGOs and demining organizations working in regions heavily littered with explosives.</p><p>The integration with the U.S. Army's ATAK (Android Tactical Assault Kit) platform represents progress in the military's modernization initiatives, coinciding with heightened defense expenditures on drone technology and AI. The OBBBA's allocation of up to $30 billion for such technologies enhances Safe Pro's prospects for securing federal contracts. Additionally, the company's partnership with Amazon Web Services (AWS) boosts its scalability, providing both cloud-based and on-the-edge solutions for immediate deployment.</p><p>Safe Pro Group's innovations in AI and drone technology signify a major advancement in threat detection and military safety, with potential uses that extend well beyond defense to include humanitarian missions across the globe. The company's dedication to innovation and its proven operational success emphasize its influence on the evolution of security and surveillance technologies.</p>
