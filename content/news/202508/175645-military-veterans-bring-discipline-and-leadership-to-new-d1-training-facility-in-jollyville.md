<p>Retired Army veterans Chané and Sandra Jackson have opened a new D1 Training facility in Jollyville, bringing military discipline and leadership experience to the athletic training concept. The facility employs a sports-science backed training regimen led by certified trainers to help people of all ages achieve their sport and fitness goals.</p><p>The Jacksons, both West Point graduates with extensive military backgrounds, join a roster of impressive existing D1 franchisees that includes professional athletes and notable sports figures. Chané Jackson, a retired Green Beret and Army Ranger, graduated from West Point in 2004 and served as an Infantry officer before working his way to Special Forces Officer, with deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan. Sandra Jackson, a retired Military Intelligence officer and 2006 West Point graduate, also completed deployments before transitioning to civilian life.</p><p>As veterans, we understand the power of discipline, teamwork, and resilience, qualities that are essential for success both on and off the field, said Sandra Jackson. D1 Training provides young athletes with the structure, mentorship, and resources they need to build confidence, develop strong work ethics, and reach their full potential.</p><p>The facility offers four age-based programs including Rookie (ages 7-11), Developmental (ages 12-14), Prep (ages 15-18) and Graduate (18+). Each fitness program is based on the five athletic-based tenets: dynamic warm-up, performance, strength program, core and conditioning, and cool down. Additional training options include team, semi-private, and one-on-one sessions with world-class coaches.</p><p>D1 Training, founded in 2001 by former NFL player Will Bartholomew, is strategically expanding across the nation through franchising with more than 100 performance centers open and over 100 additional locations in various stages of development. The brand is currently seeking financially qualified business builders, former athletes, and entrepreneurs who share a passion for fitness and youth sports.

The Jacksons background in both military leadership and data science brings a unique combination of strategic thinking and practical application to the fitness facility, potentially setting a new standard for athletic training programs in the area.</p>
