<p>Emperor Metals Inc. has filed a National Instrument 43-101 technical report supporting its maiden Mineral Resource Estimate for the Duquesne West Gold Project in Quebec. The 2025 Duquesne West MRE outlines an Inferred Mineral Resource of 26.9 million tonnes, containing 1.46 million ounces of gold at an average grade of 1.69 g/t Au.</p><p>CEO John Florek stated that the report underscores the project's compelling potential, noting robust values across multiple cut-off grades and significant growth opportunities within the deposit's initial footprint. The technical report provides critical validation for the project's resource base and supports further exploration and development planning.</p><p>The Duquesne West Gold Project is situated in Quebec's Southern Abitibi Greenstone Belt, one of the world's most prolific gold mining districts. Emperor Metals utilizes AI-driven exploration techniques to maximize the potential of its properties, including both the Duquesne West Gold Project and the Lac Pelletier Project in the same region.</p><p>Under an Option Agreement, Emperor Metals agreed to acquire a 100% interest in a mineral claim package comprising 38 claims covering approximately 1,389 hectares located in the Duparquet Township of Quebec from Duparquet Assets Ltd., a 50% owned subsidiary of Globex Mining Enterprises Inc. For more information, investors can refer to <a href="https://www.sedarplus.ca" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">SEDAR+</a> under Emperor Metals' profile.</p><p>The filing of this technical report represents a significant milestone for the company as it advances the Duquesne West Gold Project through the exploration and development pipeline. The substantial inferred resource provides a solid foundation for future drilling programs and potential economic studies, positioning Emperor Metals as an emerging player in Quebec's gold exploration sector.</p><p>The implications of this announcement extend beyond Emperor Metals' corporate development. The successful application of AI-driven exploration techniques in identifying substantial gold resources demonstrates the transformative potential of artificial intelligence in the mining industry. This approach could revolutionize resource discovery and development efficiency, potentially reducing exploration costs and timelines while increasing success rates.</p><p>For the gold mining industry, the confirmation of significant resources in established mining districts like Quebec's Abitibi Greenstone Belt reinforces the region's continued potential for new discoveries despite decades of mining activity. The project's development could contribute to regional economic growth through job creation and infrastructure development while supporting global gold supply chains.</p><p>The technical validation through the National Instrument 43-101 report provides investors with confidence in the project's geological merits and economic potential. This milestone typically serves as a catalyst for further investment and partnership opportunities, enabling accelerated development of the resource toward production.</p>
