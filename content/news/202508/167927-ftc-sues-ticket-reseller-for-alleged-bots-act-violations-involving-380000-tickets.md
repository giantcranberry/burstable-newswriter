<p>The Federal Trade Commission has filed a lawsuit against Maryland-based Key Investment Group, accusing the ticket reseller of employing advanced techniques to bypass purchase restrictions and acquire approximately 380,000 high-demand concert tickets between late 2022 and 2023. According to the complaint, the company utilized thousands of fake accounts, proxy servers, and virtual credit cards to evade <a href="https://www.ticketmaster.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Ticketmaster</a> purchase limitations, spending approximately $57 million on ticket acquisitions and reselling them for roughly $64 million in revenue.</p><p>The case represents one of the first significant tests of the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/5101" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Better Online Ticket Sales Act</a>, a 2016 law specifically designed to prevent scalpers from using automated software to circumvent ticket purchase limits. Despite the legislation's existence since 2016, enforcement has been minimal, with only a few cases pursued prior to this FTC action. The lawsuit alleges that Key Investment Group's bulk-buying practices violated this federal statute, which was passed in response to widespread consumer complaints about inability to purchase tickets for major events.</p><p>Specific allegations in the complaint highlight the company's acquisition of more than 2,000 Taylor Swift tickets across 38 shows in 2023, with the company paying $745,000 for these tickets and reselling them for nearly $2 million. In another instance, the company allegedly secured more than 1,500 tickets for a Bruce Springsteen concert at New Jersey's MetLife Stadium through 277 different accounts, generating approximately $21,000 in revenue from resales.</p><p>FTC Chairman Andrew N. Ferguson stated that the case demonstrates the agency's commitment to monitoring ticket markets and enforcing consumer protection laws. The lawsuit emerges as the Biden administration has increased scrutiny of the live-events industry, targeting various stakeholders including ticketing platforms, promoters, and venues. The Taylor Swift Eras Tour has particularly highlighted consumer frustrations with limited ticket availability and escalating resale prices, bringing renewed attention to ticket market practices.</p><p>Key Investment Group has previously challenged the allegations, calling the FTC's interpretation of the law flawed and maintaining that its practices align with industry standards. The outcome of this case could establish important precedents for how the BOTS Act is interpreted and enforced, potentially affecting ticket resale practices across the industry and impacting how ticketing platforms implement purchase restrictions for high-demand events.</p>
