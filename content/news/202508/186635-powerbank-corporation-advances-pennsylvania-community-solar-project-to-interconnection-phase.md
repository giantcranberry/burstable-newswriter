<p>PowerBank Corporation has secured site control for its 3.16 MW Honesdale ground-mount solar project in Pennsylvania, advancing the renewable energy initiative to the interconnection study phase. The project is designed to operate as a community solar program, contingent upon final approval of Pennsylvania House Bill 1842, which would enable broader solar energy access for residents across various income levels.</p><p>The Honesdale project represents PowerBank's commitment to developing distributed and community solar projects across North America. Community solar initiatives allow multiple customers to benefit from a single solar array, particularly addressing the needs of those unable to install solar panels on their own properties. This model aligns with the company's mission to deliver clean, affordable energy solutions while expanding renewable energy infrastructure.</p><p>PowerBank maintains a diverse portfolio of renewable energy projects, including utility-scale developments, host off-taker arrangements, and virtual net metering projects. The company has developed projects with a combined capacity exceeding 100 megawatts and maintains a potential development pipeline of over one gigawatt. Additional information about the company's operations and projects can be found at <a href="https://www.powerbankcorp.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.powerbankcorp.com</a>.</p><p>The advancement of the Honesdale project demonstrates the growing importance of accessible solar power options for Pennsylvania communities. As the state continues to expand its renewable energy infrastructure, this project could serve as a model for similar community solar initiatives throughout the region. The success of such projects contributes to broader clean energy adoption and supports the transition toward sustainable energy systems.</p><p>Investors and stakeholders can access additional details through the company's newsroom available at <a href="https://ibn.fm/SUUN" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://ibn.fm/SUUN</a>. The project's progress reflects the ongoing evolution of renewable energy development and the increasing focus on community-based solutions that make clean energy accessible to diverse demographic groups.</p>
