<p>Lionheart Health, Inc. has announced a strategic partnership with CoreViva to provide AI-enhanced full body MRI scans to participants in its Lionheart Klotho Wellness Program. This collaboration comes as Lionheart Health advances as a semi-finalist in the $101 million Xprize Healthspan competition, where it is testing a protocol designed to elevate circulating klotho levels through a comprehensive approach including klotho-promoting meals, daily supplements, and bioelectric klotho-enhanced exercise.</p><p>The integration of CoreViva's FDA-cleared AI technology will serve as a critical baseline measurement for patients entering the program, with follow-up scans scheduled at 12 months to track progress. Dr. Leslie Miller, Chief Medical Officer for Lionheart Health, emphasized the importance of this technology in measuring specific health improvements across multiple bodily systems.</p><p>CoreViva's mission to improve early disease detection through advanced imaging technology <a href="https://coreviva.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://coreviva.com</a> aligns with Lionheart Health's focus on healthspan longevity. The partnership represents a significant advancement in preventive medicine, combining cutting-edge imaging with targeted therapeutic interventions that address muscle health, cardiovascular health including calcification reduction, immunity health, and brain health.</p><p>The optional therapies available to participants include hyperbaric oxygen, red light therapy, infrared sauna, ozone treatment, PEMF, and various health-focused treatments addressing muscle toning, sexual health, joint health, brain health, skin health, breathing health, sleep health, stress management, inflammation reduction, blood pressure management, gut health, nature therapy, and vision and hearing health. This comprehensive approach, combined with objective AI-powered measurement, positions the collaboration as a potential benchmark for validating healthspan interventions in the rapidly growing longevity industry.</p><p>This collaboration marks an important step in validating klotho-based interventions through objective, AI-powered medical imaging, potentially setting new standards for measuring healthspan improvements in longevity research. The ability to quantitatively track progress across multiple health domains using advanced imaging technology provides both participants and researchers with unprecedented data on the effectiveness of klotho-enhancing protocols.</p>
