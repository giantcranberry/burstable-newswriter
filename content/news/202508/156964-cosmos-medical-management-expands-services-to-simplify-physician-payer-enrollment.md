<p>Cosmos Medical Management (CMM) has recently announced an expansion of its services, focusing on simplifying the physician payer enrollment process across the United States. This move addresses the growing administrative burdens healthcare providers face, particularly in credentialing, which often results in delays and denials due to outdated processes.</p><p>The enhanced services from CMM offer a comprehensive solution that includes initial credentialing, recredentialing, insurance panel enrollment, and continuous compliance monitoring. Renu Gattani, President at CMM, highlights that the service provides physicians with a dedicated team to manage the credentialing process from start to finish. This allows doctors to concentrate more on patient care rather than navigating administrative hurdles.</p><p>This development is especially crucial for physicians entering private practices, hospitals, or starting solo ventures. It aims to mitigate the risk of lost income caused by enrollment delays or errors. By optimizing the credentialing process, CMM seeks to facilitate quicker patient care initiation and reimbursement for physicians.</p><p>This service expansion is a part of CMM's overarching goal to reduce the administrative pressures on healthcare providers.
