<p>Shiplify has launched an Accessorial ROI Calculator, a tool designed to provide shippers, carriers, and third-party logistics providers with upfront visibility into shipping costs. This innovative solution allows users to anticipate and manage accessorial fees before shipments are made, offering real-time estimates of potential savings. The calculator's introduction marks a significant step towards mitigating disputes and preserving profits across the supply chain.</p><p>North Winship, President of Shiplify, highlighted the limitations of traditional freight invoicing, which often leads to reactive measures that can undermine trust and profitability. The Accessorial ROI Calculator shifts the paradigm towards proactive financial planning and fosters collaboration among supply chain partners. By utilizing Shiplify's proprietary data and industry benchmarks, the tool delivers precise insights into how specific accessorials, such as residential delivery and liftgate use, impact overall shipping expenses.</p><p>The timing of this launch is particularly pertinent, as underscored by research from Bart De Muynck Strategic Advice, which points to the persistent challenges associated with accessorial fees. These fees not only diminish margins but also create tension among financial stakeholders. Shiplify's calculator directly addresses these issues by equipping users with the visibility and tools needed for effective accessorial billing management.</p><p>For those keen on understanding the potential savings and advantages of the Accessorial ROI Calculator, Shiplify encourages a visit to <a href='https://shiplify.com/roi-calculator/' rel='nofollow' target='_blank'>https://shiplify.com/roi-calculator/</a>. Moreover, a complimentary research report by Bart De Muynck, titled 'Untangling the Hidden Costs and Blindspots in LTL Shipping', is available for download, providing deeper insights into the freight industry's challenges and solutions.</p>
