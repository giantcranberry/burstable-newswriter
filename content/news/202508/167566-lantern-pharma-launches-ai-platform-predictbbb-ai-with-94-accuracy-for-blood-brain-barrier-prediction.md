<p>Lantern Pharma Inc. has publicly launched predictBBB.ai(TM), an AI-driven module for predicting small-molecule blood-brain barrier permeability with 94% accuracy. The tool achieves 95% sensitivity and 89% specificity using real-time ensemble machine learning, setting a new computational benchmark for central nervous system drug discovery.</p><p>Crossing the blood-brain barrier remains one of pharmaceutical development's most persistent challenges, with traditionally only 2-6% of small molecules successfully penetrating this critical barrier. Lantern Pharma aims to transform this bottleneck by providing researchers with real-time predictions powered by billions of molecular features from its vast data lake and advanced ensemble algorithms.</p><p>The platform is publicly accessible through a freemium model at <a href="https://ibn.fm/9RZYo" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://ibn.fm/9RZYo</a>, designed to drive widespread adoption, foster strategic partnerships, and accelerate therapeutic development for CNS disorders. This accessibility represents a significant shift from proprietary, closed systems to open-access tools that could democratize advanced drug discovery capabilities.</p><p>Lantern Pharma's subsidiary Starlight Therapeutics recently secured FDA IND clearance for its Phase Ib/IIa trial combining STAR-001 (LP-184) and spironolactone in recurrent glioblastoma multiforme, demonstrating the company's parallel progress in clinical applications. The predictBBB.ai tool could potentially enhance such clinical programs by improving drug candidate selection and optimization for brain-targeted therapies.</p><p>The development comes as the biotechnology industry increasingly embraces artificial intelligence and machine learning to address complex biological challenges. Lantern Pharma hosts additional predictive and analytical modules in development, leveraging its large-scale data infrastructure and algorithmic approach to redefine oncology and CNS drug development methodologies.</p><p>The public availability of such high-accuracy prediction tools marks a significant advancement in computational drug discovery, potentially reducing development timelines and costs while improving success rates for neurological treatments. Researchers worldwide can now access sophisticated BBB permeability predictions that were previously limited to well-funded pharmaceutical companies with proprietary systems.</p>
