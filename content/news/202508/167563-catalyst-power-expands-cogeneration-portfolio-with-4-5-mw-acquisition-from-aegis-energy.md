<p>Catalyst Power Holdings has acquired a 4.5 megawatt portfolio of operational and in-development cogeneration projects from Aegis Energy Services, expanding the company's presence in key Northeast markets. The acquisition builds on Catalyst Power's recent growth momentum following strategic investments from DRW Holdings LLC and BP Energy Partners.</p><p>Cogeneration, also known as combined heat and power (CHP), produces electricity and heat from a single fuel source. By capturing and reusing waste heat, CHP systems can achieve efficiencies of up to 90%, helping reduce energy costs and emissions for buildings with significant heating or cooling demands. This technology represents a practical solution for businesses facing rising energy costs and aging infrastructure challenges.</p><p>Gabriel Phillips, CEO of Catalyst Power, stated that this acquisition allows the company to deliver efficient, resilient onsite energy to more customers across the region. Catalyst Power serves as an independent energy solutions provider that integrates retail electricity with commercial energy solutions, helping businesses reduce costs and generate revenue without requiring upfront investment from customers.</p><p>The company's turnkey CHP systems provide customized energy solutions tailored to each customer's specific needs. This expansion into additional cogeneration capacity comes at a time when many commercial and industrial operations are seeking more reliable and cost-effective energy alternatives. The Northeast region, with its aging energy infrastructure and high energy costs, presents significant opportunities for cogeneration deployment.</p><p>Catalyst Power's suite of solutions includes customized Connected Microgrid solutions, solar energy, energy storage, and CHP systems. The company specializes in serving middle-market commercial and industrial end-use customers, providing comprehensive energy management services. More information about the company's services and approach can be found at <a href="https://catalystpower.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://catalystpower.com</a>.</p><p>The acquisition demonstrates the growing importance of distributed energy resources and onsite power generation in modern energy markets. As businesses increasingly seek to control energy costs while improving sustainability, cogeneration systems offer a proven technology that addresses both economic and environmental concerns. The expansion of Catalyst Power's CHP portfolio contributes to the broader transition toward more decentralized and efficient energy systems in the Northeast region.</p>
