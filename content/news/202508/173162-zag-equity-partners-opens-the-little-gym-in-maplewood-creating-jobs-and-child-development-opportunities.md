<p>ZAG Equity Partners, a privately held investment firm, has announced the opening of The Little Gym of Maplewood, a children's enrichment and physical development center located at 1807 Springfield Avenue. The 4,000-square-foot facility officially opens on September 15th and is expected to create 10 new local jobs while serving families across Essex County with specialized programming.</p><p>The center offers movement-based learning, imaginative play, and hands-on instruction designed to help children build confidence, coordination, and social-emotional skills. Programs include parent/child classes, enrichment programs for preschool and school-age children, and themed birthday parties featuring music-led activities. The facility represents ZAG Equity Partners' investment in mission-driven businesses that create lasting value for families and communities.</p><p>George and Andrea Wilson, principals of ZAG Equity Partners and Essex County residents, were inspired to bring The Little Gym to Maplewood after witnessing the positive impact the program had on their own child. George Wilson stated that the center aligns perfectly with their vision of providing nurturing, fun, and enriching environments that help children grow physically, socially, and emotionally.</p><p>Ashley Downey has been appointed as General Manager, bringing extensive experience in early childhood programming and team leadership to ensure the delivery of high standards of service, safety, and instruction. While this marks ZAG Equity Partners' first The Little Gym location, the firm is actively evaluating opportunities to expand the brand's presence throughout the region.

The Little Gym, established in 1976, operates nearly 400 locations globally under Unleashed Brands, which includes portfolio brands focused on helping children learn, play, and grow. This expansion demonstrates how private investment can directly benefit local communities through job creation and accessible developmental programs for children.</p>
