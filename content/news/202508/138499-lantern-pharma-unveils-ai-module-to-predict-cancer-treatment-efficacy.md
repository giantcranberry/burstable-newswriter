<p>Lantern Pharma Inc. (NASDAQ: LTRN) has recently introduced an artificial intelligence module designed to predict the efficacy of cancer treatment combinations, particularly those involving DNA-damaging agents (DDAs) and DNA damage response inhibitors (DDRis). This innovation is part of the company's RADR(R) platform, which focuses on AI-driven drug development in oncology. With the global market for combination cancer therapies projected to surpass $50 billion by 2030, this development is poised to have a substantial impact on the field.</p><p>The AI module leverages a vast dataset encompassing genomic, transcriptomic, and clinical information to predict treatment synergy and patient responses. Its creation was informed by an analysis of 221 clinical trials, resulting in a predictive algorithm that has already contributed to the design of Lanternâ€™s FDA-cleared Phase 1B/2 trial for triple-negative breast cancer. The module has notably identified promising outcomes for non-PARP DDRi combinations with DNA-damaging agents in certain cancer subtypes.</p><p>Currently, Lantern Pharma is investigating licensing opportunities to make this module available for wider use in oncology. This move could transform the development and personalization of cancer treatments, offering hope for more effective and tailored therapeutic strategies.
