<p>The hospitality industry is at the forefront of a technological revolution, with artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics setting new benchmarks for operational efficiency and guest satisfaction. Recent findings highlight a 30â€“40% reduction in operational costs for hotels embracing these technologies, alongside notable improvements in revenue management and customer service. This shift is not merely a trend but a substantial growth sector, with the AI in hospitality market projected to reach $1.46 billion by 2029, growing at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 57.8%. Similarly, the global hospitality robotics market is expected to expand from $24.38 billion this year to $107.24 billion by 2034.</p><p>Leading this innovative charge is <a href='https://www.nightfood.com' rel='nofollow' target='_blank'>Nightfood Holdings Inc.</a>, a pioneer in integrating hotel ownership with AI-driven Robotics-as-a-Service (RaaS).
