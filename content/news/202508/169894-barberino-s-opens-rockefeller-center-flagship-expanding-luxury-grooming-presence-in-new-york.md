<p>Barberino's, the luxury Italian barbershop and grooming brand, has secured a 10-year lease for a 645-square-foot space at 55 West 49th Street at 30 Rockefeller Plaza, establishing its second U.S. location and New York City flagship store. The transaction was facilitated by Alvarez & Marsal Property Solutions, with Scott Schuster of Schuster Group Inc. and Lucas Kooyman of AM-PS representing Barberino's, while Tishman Speyer was represented in-house by Reed Zukerman.</p><p>This expansion into Rockefeller Center represents a significant milestone for the brand, which operates 16 stores across Italy and opened its first international location in Seoul in 2023. Michele Callegari, co-founder and CEO of Barberino's, emphasized the growing importance of human-centered retail experiences, noting that neighborhood stores fostering real relationships and authentic encounters are increasingly necessary in a digital world. The new location will feature three barber chairs and offer tailored wellness services including haircuts, shaves, beard trims, shampooing, and hot towel service, all adorned with the brand's signature green color scheme.</p><p>Lucas Kooyman of <a href="https://www.ampsre.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">AM-PS</a> highlighted Rockefeller Center's status as a quintessentially New York asset, making it an ideal location for Barberino's surrounded by other luxury tenants and catering to office workers, residents, and visitors alike. The shop will feature Barberino's full line of in-house haircare and skincare products, along with curated selections from high-end brand partnerships, blending Italian grooming traditions with innovative techniques.</p><p>EB Kelly, Senior Managing Director at Tishman Speyer and Head of Rockefeller Center, stated that Barberino's decision to establish a presence at the landmark property underscores the continued demand for high-quality, heritage-driven brands. The arrival strengthens Rockefeller Center's diverse retail mix and supports its vision as a destination where tradition and innovation meet. The new boutique at <a href="https://rockefellercenter.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Rockefeller Center</a> is scheduled to open this fall, further cementing Barberino's position as a top operator in Manhattan's grooming sector.</p><p>This transaction marks the second deal that Schuster and Kooyman have completed within the Tishman Speyer portfolio, demonstrating their success in placing global luxury and lifestyle brands into high-profile retail destinations. The expansion reflects broader trends in the premium grooming market, where consumers increasingly seek personalized, high-quality services over automated alternatives, signaling a shift toward experiential retail in luxury sectors.</p>
