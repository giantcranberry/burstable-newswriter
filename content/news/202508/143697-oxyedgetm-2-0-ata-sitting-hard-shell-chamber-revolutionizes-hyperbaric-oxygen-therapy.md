This cutting-edge product is redefining standards in comfort, technological innovation, and cost-efficiency, addressing the demands of home users and clinical practitioners alike. The OxyEdge™ distinguishes itself from conventional tube-style chambers with its seated design, which significantly improves user comfort and functionality. This design allows individuals to recline, relax, and even engage with electronic devices during their therapy sessions, offering a seamless blend of treatment and convenience.</p><p>Customization lies at the heart of the OxyEdge™ chamber, with each unit handmade to order. Clients can personalize their chambers with a variety of colors, finishes, and features.

A user-friendly touchscreen control panel inside the chamber enables adjustments to pressure, temperature, lighting, and session duration, putting control at the user's fingertips. The chamber's advanced air management system, featuring an integrated dehumidifier, cooling mechanism, air purification, and anion generator, guarantees superior air quality throughout the session.</p><p>Among its innovative features, the OxyEdge™'s 20L/Min oxygen delivery system stands out, providing high-purity oxygen directly to the user and eliminating the reliance on cumbersome tanks. This system not only simplifies operation but also enhances the therapy's effectiveness. The chamber's design prioritizes energy efficiency, user comfort, and convenience, evidenced by its upright sitting configuration, electric reclining chair equipped with built-in heat and massage functions, and dual red light panels that offer photobiomodulation benefits. These features collectively support cellular regeneration and inflammation reduction, further enriching the therapeutic experience.</p><p>The OxyEdge™ chamber is designed with accessibility and safety in mind. Its 34″ diameter ensures easy installation through most doorways, removing the need for structural modifications. The spacious interior comfortably accommodates a wide range of users, providing ample room to recline and breathe with ease.
