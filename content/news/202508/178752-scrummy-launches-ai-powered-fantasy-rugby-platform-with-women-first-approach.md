<p>SCRUMMY, a leading global fantasy sports company, has launched an AI-driven platform designed to transform rugby fan engagement through comprehensive data integration and inclusive community features. The platform provides real-time match tracking, player statistics, and rugby data insights across youth competitions, men's and women's professional leagues, and global tournaments, positioning itself as a rugby-first solution for fantasy sports enthusiasts.</p><p>The launch coincides with the Women's Rugby World Cup hosted by England from August 22 to September 27, 2025, demonstrating SCRUMMY's commitment to elevating women's sports visibility. Kisset Chirengende, Sports Executive and Co-Founder of SCRUMMY, stated the company's vision focuses on growing rugby at every level while ensuring women's rugby maintains a strong presence in the sport. The platform's women-first approach includes full integration of women's international rugby from launch, ensuring visibility and storytelling for female athletes.</p><p>SCRUMMY's AI-powered insights utilize proprietary match data to bring player cards to life, helping fans track performance, real-time match play, and predictive analytics. The platform connects more than 120 rugby nations and over 475 million fans worldwide, making rugby one of the top 10 most popular sports globally according to The Rugby Paper. This extensive reach is complemented by an intuitive interface designed for casual fans, die-hard supporters, and newcomers alike.</p><p>The company's commitment to youth development was demonstrated through a successful pilot program earlier this year, partnering with youth rugby leagues across South Africa and Zimbabwe. The program reached registration capacity within 12 hours, highlighting the demand for accessible rugby platforms. SCRUMMY further strengthened this commitment by sponsoring the Derby Day Schools Rugby Festival in Zimbabwe, one of the premier international schoolboy events.</p><p>SCRUMMY's platform features built-in community elements that allow users to create leagues, follow favorite players, and compete globally while supporting sport growth. The free mobile application is available for download at <a href="https://apps.apple.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://apps.apple.com</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://play.google.com</a>, making fantasy rugby accessible to a broad audience. This launch represents a significant step toward making fantasy rugby not just a game, but a way to celebrate and support the fast-growing global rugby culture through advanced technology and inclusive design.</p>
