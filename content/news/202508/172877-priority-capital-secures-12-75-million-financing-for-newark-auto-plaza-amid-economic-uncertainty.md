<p>Priority Capital Advisory has arranged $12.75 million in senior debt financing for the recapitalization of Newark Auto Plaza, a multi-tenant automotive dealership complex in Fremont, California. The financing was secured on behalf of borrower Nearon Enterprises for the specialty retail property located at 39700-39750 Balentine Drive and 5623-5633 John Muir Drive.</p><p>Zachary Streit, Founder and President of Priority Capital Advisory, noted the unique challenges posed by the timing of the financing. The client pursued a non-recourse loan from a regional bank for the auto dealership property while navigating changing macroeconomic conditions influenced by recent tariff announcements and growing trade tensions. After evaluating multiple proposals from regional banks, the firm selected a lending partner positioned to support the client long-term.</p><p>The 14.8-acre property features three buildings totaling 110,540 square feet, including showrooms and service/repair centers. The complex is fully occupied by Fremont Ford, Winn KIA of Fremont, and Cruise America RV. Strategically located approximately 20 minutes from San Jose and Silicon Valley, the property sits 40 miles southeast of downtown San Francisco with direct adjacency to the I-880 Freeway and 800 feet of frontage.</p><p>Blaine Emmons, EVP/CFO of Nearon Enterprises, expressed appreciation for Priority Capital's patience in finding the appropriate lender during the process. The successful closing demonstrates the firm's capability to deliver liquidity solutions for sophisticated sponsors in challenging capital markets environments.</p><p>Since its establishment just over a year ago, Priority Capital Advisory has closed more than $500 million in debt financing across 23 transactions. In the past four months alone, Streit has led the closings of six retail loans totaling $131.25 million. The transaction highlights the continued demand for specialized financing solutions in the automotive retail sector despite broader economic uncertainties.
