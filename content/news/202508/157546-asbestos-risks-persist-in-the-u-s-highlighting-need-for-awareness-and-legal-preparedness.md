<p>The legacy of asbestos, a material once celebrated for its heat resistance and durability, continues to cast a long shadow over public health in the United States. Despite being banned in many countries, asbestos-related diseases such as mesothelioma, lung cancer, and asbestosis still pose a significant threat, with symptoms often emerging decades after exposure. Justinian C. Lane Esq., founder of Asbestos Claims Law, sheds light on the ongoing risks and the critical need for awareness and legal preparedness among those potentially affected.</p><p>Industries such as construction, shipbuilding, and auto repair are particularly at risk today, as older materials in these sectors may still contain asbestos. A recent national survey conducted by Lane's firm uncovered startling statistics, including that 91% of U.S. homes have never been tested for asbestos, despite the high likelihood of its presence in structures built before 1980. This oversight underscores a widespread lack of awareness about the dangers lurking in many American homes and workplaces.</p><p>Lane also addresses common misconceptions about asbestos, such as the belief that it is entirely banned in the U.S. or that it poses no risk unless directly handled. He strongly advises homeowners and prospective buyers to seek certified asbestos inspections before undertaking renovations or making purchases, to mitigate both health and legal risks. The legal ramifications of selling a property with undisclosed asbestos presence are significant, with Lane emphasizing the importance of transparency to avoid future liabilities.</p><p>Beyond advocating for legal rights, Lane's firm is dedicated to public education, offering resources like a detailed medical video on mesothelioma and access to the <a href='https://www.asbestosclaims.law' rel='nofollow' target='_blank'>Worldwide Asbestos Research Database (WARD)</a>. This initiative aims to compile and preserve historical documents related to asbestos exposure, providing invaluable assistance to families, journalists, and researchers seeking to uncover the full extent of past exposures.</p><p>The discussion with Lane highlights the enduring threat of asbestos in American society and the collective responsibility to combat it through education, legal recourse, and policy reform. For those seeking more information on asbestos safety and legal rights, resources are available to help navigate the complexities of this ongoing public health issue.</p>
