<p>Trilogy Metals Inc. stands to benefit significantly from tightening copper supply-demand dynamics, holding a 50% interest in one of North America's richest undeveloped copper districts. The company's strategic position is reinforced by high-grade resources, a stable jurisdiction in Alaska, and a robust joint venture partnership that provides a solid foundation for future development.</p><p>The company's prudent cash management, combined with flexible capital-raising tools through its Base Shelf Prospectus and ATM Program, enhances its ability to fund project advancement while minimizing shareholder dilution. This financial discipline positions Trilogy to capitalize on the growing copper demand driven by the global energy transition, which continues to reshape commodity markets worldwide.</p><p>Trilogy Metals holds its 50% interest through Ambler Metals LLC, which maintains 100% interest in the Upper Kobuk Mineral Projects located in northwestern Alaska. The joint venture partnership with South32, a globally diversified mining and metals company that exercised its option to form a 50/50 joint venture on December 19, 2019, strengthens the project's development capabilities. Additional information about the company's developments can be found at <a href="https://ibn.fm/TMQ" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://ibn.fm/TMQ</a>.</p><p>The UKMP is situated within the Ambler Mining District, recognized as one of the world's richest and most prospective copper-dominant districts. The district hosts world-class polymetallic volcanogenic massive sulphide deposits containing copper, zinc, lead, gold, and silver, along with carbonate replacement deposits that feature high-grade copper and cobalt mineralization. Exploration has concentrated on two primary deposits: the Arctic VMS deposit and the Bornite carbonate replacement deposit, both located within a land package spanning approximately 190,929 hectares.</p><p>Ambler Metals has established an agreement with NANA Regional Corporation Inc., an Alaska Native Corporation that provides a framework for exploration and potential development of the Ambler Mining District in cooperation with local communities. This partnership underscores Trilogy's commitment to developing the district into a premier North American copper producer while respecting and protecting subsistence livelihoods in the region.</p><p>The combination of grade, jurisdiction, and scale at the Upper Kobuk Mineral Projects highlights Trilogy Metals' potential to contribute meaningfully to meeting the world's increasing copper requirements, particularly as renewable energy infrastructure and electric vehicle production drive unprecedented demand for the metal.</p>
