<p>Steel Peak, a commercial real estate investment firm with a focus on industrial outdoor storage (IOS) properties, has made a significant addition to its portfolio with the purchase of a property located at 758 W 1500 N in Salt Lake City for $3.1 million. This marks the firm's second IOS property in the area in 2025, expanding its holdings to eight properties across Utah, California, and Washington since its establishment in January 2024.</p><p>The newly acquired property boasts a 15,218-square-foot industrial building on 2.34 acres, situated in the Northwest Industrial Submarket of Salt Lake City. Its strategic location near I-15 and other major interstate highways makes it an ideal spot for industrial and logistical operations. The property's M-2 (Heavy Manufacturing) zoning further enhances its value by permitting a broad spectrum of industrial activities, a feature that is becoming increasingly rare in the market.</p><p>Blake Rodgers, Principal at Steel Peak, highlighted the firm's interest in Salt Lake City's robust demand for contractor yards and IOS properties. The acquisition was driven by the property's zoning and prime location, which meet the needs of contractors, equipment rental companies, and material suppliers in search of extensive outdoor storage spaces. Pasha Johnson, Co-Founder of Steel Peak, pointed to the rapid construction activity in the Mountain West as a key factor fueling the demand for such properties.</p><p>Steel Peak intends to carry out strategic enhancements to the property, including cosmetic updates and office improvements, to appeal to premium tenants. The firm handled its own representation in the acquisition, while Wolff Excavating Inc., the seller, was represented by Tanner Riedel of Colliers International.</p><p>Looking forward, Steel Peak is set to continue its pursuit of IOS investment opportunities in the Western U.S., focusing on properties with capitalized values ranging from $5 million to $50 million. The firm's approach encompasses direct investments and collaborations with institutional and high net-worth investors, targeting assets that present substantial potential for value creation.
