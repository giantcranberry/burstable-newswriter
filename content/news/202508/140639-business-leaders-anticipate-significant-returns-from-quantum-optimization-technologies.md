<p>A survey conducted by Wakefield Research in collaboration with D-Wave Quantum Inc. (NYSE: QBTS) reveals a strong belief among business leaders in the financial potential of quantum optimization technologies. With 27% of executives expecting a return on investment (ROI) exceeding $5 million and 46% anticipating between $1 million to $5 million within the first year of implementation, the findings underscore the high expectations surrounding quantum computing's ability to address optimization challenges beyond classical computing's reach.</p><p>The survey, which engaged 400 decision-makers from various industries across North America, Europe, and the Asia-Pacific region in May 2025, found that 81% believe classical computing has reached its optimization limits. Industries such as logistics, supply chain, manufacturing, planning and inventory, and R&D were pinpointed as areas where quantum optimization could offer significant benefits. An overwhelming 88% of participants stated their organizations would aggressively pursue even a modest 5% improvement in optimization.</p><p>With 53% of respondents planning to integrate quantum computing into their workflows and an additional 27% considering it, the survey indicates a significant shift towards quantum computing adoption in the business sector. This transition reflects a broader recognition of quantum computing's evolution from a theoretical concept to a practical tool capable of tackling real-world operational challenges.
