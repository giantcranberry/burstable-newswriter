<p>Modern Fence Technologies has recently expanded its assortment of American-made fence hardware, introducing products designed to meet the demands of both residential and commercial clients. This expansion includes wrap-around hinges, chain link stretchers, and drop rods, all crafted for durability and user-friendly installation. These products are now more accessible through professional contractors and retail partners nationwide, providing essential tools for fence installers, property owners, and construction professionals.</p><p>The SS Wrap Around Hinge line is notable for its smooth 180-degree gate swing capability, facilitated by bearings and removable clevis pins. Made from stainless steel, these hinges offer resistance to rust and corrosion, suitable for a variety of outdoor settings. The Bear Hold Chain Link Fence Stretchers are another key addition, designed to simplify the installation and maintenance of chain link fencing by ensuring even tension and minimizing sag. This innovation is especially advantageous for smaller teams or solo workers, making the installation process more efficient.</p><p>Drop rods, part of the newly expanded product line, enhance security for double gates. Available in stainless or mild steel and in lengths ranging from 24 to 48 inches, these rods come equipped with mounting hangers and lockable guides that work with standard padlocks. This feature directly addresses security needs for driveways and commercial entrances, offering peace of mind to users.</p><p>A spokesperson for Modern Fence Technologies highlighted the company's focus on quality and innovation, stating, "Our expanded fence hardware offerings reflect our dedication to American manufacturing and innovative design." Manufactured in the U.S. using American steel, many of these products are powder-coated for extra weather resistance. Each item is shipped complete with all necessary mounting hardware, ensuring a straightforward installation process.</p><p>For further details on these products, visit <a href="https://mftfence.com/fence-hardware-that-gets-the-job-done-drop-rods-fence-stretchers-and-wrap-around-hinges" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://mftfence.com/fence-hardware-that-gets-the-job-done-drop-rods-fence-stretchers-and-wrap-around-hinges</a>.
