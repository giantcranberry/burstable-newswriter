<p>Across the western United States, wildfires have evolved from seasonal occurrences to year-round systemic threats that strain insurers, depress real estate markets, and destabilize communities. FortressFire, through its science-driven AMP Platform, is challenging traditional approaches by focusing on structure-level ignition prevention rather than broad geographic risk zones.</p><p>The company's Property Ignition Model (PIM) uses thermodynamic modeling to analyze terrain, fuel loads, materials, and structural interactions, predicting ignition vulnerability with 95% accuracy in back-testing against major California fires. This granular assessment replaces insurance industry practices that lump properties into broad hazard zones, leading to premium increases, policy cancellations, and market exits.</p><p>FortressFire's closed-loop AMP Platform operates through four phases: Assess creates 3-D models using satellite imagery and onsite inspections; Mitigate prescribes targeted structure hardening and vegetation management; Monitor integrates continuous sensor and satellite feeds for threat alerts; and Protect offers seasonal maintenance and real-time preparedness support. The platform enables properties to achieve near-zero ignition risk through science-based interventions while preserving aesthetic character.</p><p>The technology addresses the worsening wildfire-insurance crisis by providing insurers with auditable proof of risk reduction, enabling competitive pricing and portfolio diversification in high-risk states. For homeowners facing insurance rejections, FortressFire offers actionable mitigation playbooks that often restore insurability by addressing specific risk drivers like roof type, ember exposure, and vegetation density.</p><p>Partnerships with organizations like the CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF REALTORSÂ® demonstrate the platform's broader impact, stabilizing real estate transactions and supporting regulatory rate approvals through transparent, physics-based methodology. The approach represents a fundamental mindset shift from pricing for catastrophe response to engineering for ignition prevention, proving that losses aren't inevitable even in fire-adapted landscapes.</p>
