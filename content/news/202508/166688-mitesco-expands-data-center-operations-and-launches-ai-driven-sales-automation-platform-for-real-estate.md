<p>Mitesco, Inc. has announced significant developments in its business strategy, including expansion of its data center operations and the upcoming launch of an AI-driven sales automation platform called Robo Agent. The platform is designed specifically for the residential real estate sector and will debut as an integrated add-on module within the Follow Up Bossâ„¢ CRM, which is now part of Zillow Group. With over 3 million agents across the United States according to the National Association of Realtors, this market represents a substantial revenue opportunity for the company.</p><p>The company's shares are now trading on the OTC-QB Venture Market, reflecting improved investor confidence and volume trends. CEO Mack Leath stated that the mid-term goal includes an uplisting to NASDAQ or a senior exchange, which would better position the company for institutional interest. Mitesco is also evaluating strategic international listings as part of broader merger and acquisition initiatives in growth markets, particularly those advancing cloud infrastructure and AI-driven productivity tools.</p><p>Centcore, Mitesco's cloud infrastructure division accessible at <a href="https://www.centcoreusa.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.centcoreusa.com</a>, reported increased active user engagement in the second quarter with strong momentum from small to medium businesses and municipal sectors seeking reliable remote backup solutions. The division's infrastructure meets rigorous compliance standards including SOC 2, Tier 3+, and CJIS, providing enterprise-grade security and reliability to a broad range of customers. General Manager Brian Valania emphasized that the traction validates their channel partnership model, particularly highlighting Accucom's role as the lead systems support team for their Melbourne, Florida facility.</p><p>The Robo Agent platform has entered a private preview phase with agents from leading brokerages including Berkshire Hathaway Home Services, Sotheby's, EXP Realty, and Caldwell Banker. Early feedback indicates strong demand for automated client outreach tools that integrate seamlessly into daily workflows. Unlike standalone tools, Robo Agent operates within agents' existing CRM systems, minimizing adoption friction while driving measurable productivity gains. With over 200,000 agents already within Zillow's Premier Agent network, the company is positioning Robo Agent for rapid adoption upon its scheduled fourth quarter launch.</p><p>Mitesco remains active in its acquisition strategy, targeting complementary businesses in software, data center services, and emerging technology verticals that enhance scale and support long-term margin expansion. The company's venture arm focuses on productivity-driven cloud technologies designed for business and government applications, with areas of emphasis including infrastructure, process automation, analytics, and data center tooling. These strategic moves come as the company continues to execute on its growth-oriented approach to technology platforms that improve efficiency, access, and affordability across multiple sectors.</p>
