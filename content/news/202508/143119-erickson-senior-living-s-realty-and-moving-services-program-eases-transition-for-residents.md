<p>Erickson Senior Living has set a new standard for senior relocation with its Realty and Moving Services program, designed to simplify the moving process for its residents. The program, as demonstrated by Eugene Eanes's recent move to Avery Point in Short Pump, Va., offers a comprehensive suite of services that cater to the unique needs of seniors transitioning to a new home. By leveraging a network of trusted professionals, including real estate agents, downsizing experts, and moving companies, the program ensures a hassle-free experience for its members.</p><p>Jacquelyn Weir, a planning and moving consultant with the sales team, plays a crucial role in the program's success. Through complimentary home visits, Weir assesses residents' needs and preferences, employing innovative tools like magnetic boards and digital renderings to help visualize the new living space. This personalized approach not only reduces the stress associated with moving but also guarantees that residents feel at home immediately upon arrival.</p><p>The program's flexibility is another key feature, allowing residents to customize the moving process according to their specific requirements. Eugene Eanes's experience highlights the program's benefits; with the assistance of Catherine Ham, a preferred real estate agent, Eugene sold his home for $70,000 above the listing price. Furthermore, by participating in the Move On Us program, Eugene received up to $2,000 in moving expense reimbursements, showcasing the financial advantages of utilizing preferred agents.</p><p>Downsizing, often a daunting task for seniors, is made manageable through the program's assistance in selling, donating, or consigning unwanted items. Eugene's positive encounter with a preferred packing company further illustrates the program's commitment to providing professional support, ensuring an effortless and enjoyable moving experience.</p><p>Erickson Senior Living's dedication to offering a stress-free transition is evident in the adaptability and comprehensiveness of its Realty and Moving Services program.
