<p>pgEdge, Inc. has launched the latest release of its distributed PostgreSQL cloud service, pgEdge Cloud, marking significant advancements in high availability, conflict resolution, and security compliance for geo-distributed applications. The update represents the first fully distributed Database as a Service built entirely on open source PostgreSQL, optimized for deployment across multiple cloud regions to address latency reduction and data residency requirements.</p><p>The new release introduces multi-availability zone support, enabling customers to deploy multiple nodes within the same region across different availability zones. This enhancement provides greater fault tolerance and compliance with high-availability best practices, allowing for more flexible and resilient cluster topologies. Businesses can now place multiple nodes in the same or different availability zones within a region, significantly improving application reliability for mission-critical operations.</p><p>Enhanced automatic conflict resolution capabilities reduce the need for application-level exception handling code in distributed environments. The system now automatically resolves scenarios like duplicate inserts and missing delete targets, with added support for handling unique constraint violations using configurable Last-Write-Wins logic. These improvements simplify application development in multi-node deployments, making distributed database management more accessible to developers.</p><p>Performance improvements include significant gains in replication operations, with exception handling now performed in-memory to reduce latency and speed up conflict resolution. The lag tracking system has been redesigned to operate at the target node, improving measurement accuracy and eliminating misleading lag reports during idle periods. These upgrades result in faster, more reliable replication behavior across distributed clusters, addressing critical performance concerns for global applications.</p><p>Concurrently, pgEdge has successfully completed a System and Organization Controls (SOC) 2 Type II audit performed by Sensiba LLP. The audit, developed by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, provides comprehensive examination of controls relevant to security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, and privacy. pgEdge's SOC 2 Type II report received a clean audit opinion with no noted exceptions, demonstrating the platform's commitment to enterprise-grade security standards.</p><p>The enhancements build upon the latest release of pgEdge Platform v25, which includes significant upgrades to the Spock extension, pgEdge's advanced logical replication engine. The combined improvements position pgEdge Cloud as a robust solution for organizations requiring always-on availability and seamless conflict handling in distributed database environments. The service is available for free sign-up at <a href="https://www.pgedge.com/get-started/cloud" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.pgedge.com/get-started/cloud</a>, providing enterprises with access to distributed PostgreSQL capabilities without upfront investment.</p>
