<p>D1 Training has launched a new fitness facility in Coeur d'Alene at 8632 N Government Way, introducing athletic-based training programs to the local community. The facility employs a sports-science backed training regimen led by certified trainers designed to help people of all ages achieve their sport and fitness goals.</p><p>Local entrepreneurs and veterans Richard Smith and Kyle Parkinson lead the new location, joining a roster of existing franchisees that includes professional athletes. Smith, a former Division I wrestler with exercise science background, was motivated to bring D1 to Coeur d'Alene after identifying a gap in structured, sports-science-based training for young athletes in the region.</p><p>The facility features premium turf and equipment, glass garage doors, and parent viewing areas designed with intentionality and excellence. Smith emphasized that the opening represents more than just a physical space, stating that it showcases the heart of D1â€”their people and community-focused approach to fitness training.</p><p>The training center is supported by a team of elite local talent including General Manager Jake McNitt, strength coach JJ Njoku, and Assistant General Manager McKaylee Sloane. Parkinson described the team as not just experts but mentors who care about each athlete and are committed to helping people grow in strength, confidence, and purpose through structured athletic development.</p><p>D1 Training offers four age-based programs: Rookie (ages 7-11), Developmental (ages 12-14), Prep (ages 15-18), and D1 Adult. Each program utilizes the five athletic-based tenets of dynamic warm-up, performance, strength program, core and conditioning, and cool down. The facility also provides group, semi-private, and one-on-one training with world-class coaches.</p><p>The Coeur d'Alene location is part of D1 Training's national expansion through franchising, with more than 100 performance centers currently open and over 100 additional locations in development. The brand continues to seek qualified business builders, former athletes, and entrepreneurs who share a passion for fitness and youth sports.
