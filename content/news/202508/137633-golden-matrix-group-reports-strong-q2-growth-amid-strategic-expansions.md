<p>Golden Matrix Group Inc. (NASDAQ: GMGI) has announced its financial and operational results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2025, revealing a 9.6% year-over-year increase in total revenue to $43.2 million. This growth comes despite challenges from customer-friendly sports outcomes in its European operations, demonstrating the company's ability to navigate market volatilities effectively.</p><p>Operational achievements include a significant 30% rise in wager volume at Meridianbet and a 124% increase in new registrations, attributed to product improvements and the successful entry into the Brazilian market. The company's gross profit reached $24.4 million, with a gross margin of approximately 56%, reflecting a 135-basis point improvement from the previous year. However, a net loss of $3.6 million was reported, primarily due to higher operating costs and interest expenses from debt prepayment.</p><p>Meridianbet, a cornerstone of Golden Matrix's portfolio, reported a 16% year-over-year revenue growth to $29.2 million, with online revenue climbing by 20%. The casino segment experienced a notable 29% increase in Gross Gaming Revenue (GGR), with turnover hitting $434 million. The strategic expansion into Brazil, a market with an estimated value of $5.6 billion in 2025, and the addition of 2,500 games to its content library highlight the company's commitment to growth and enhancing player engagement.</p><p>The raffle ticket businesses, especially RKings Competitions, have set new performance benchmarks, achieving record daily revenues. The introduction of advanced systems has played a pivotal role in this success, with RKings Competitions processing over 30,000 orders in a single day on August 1, 2025.</p><p>Looking forward, Golden Matrix anticipates full-year 2025 revenue to be between $185 million and $188 million, representing a 22% to 24% growth over 2024. The company's strategy focuses on penetrating regulated markets, advancing its proprietary technology, and maximizing shareholder value through prudent capital management.
