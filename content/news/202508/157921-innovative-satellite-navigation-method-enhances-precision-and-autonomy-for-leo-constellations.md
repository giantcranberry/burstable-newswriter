<p>The development of large Low Earth Orbit (LEO) constellations has necessitated advancements in satellite navigation systems to ensure precision and autonomy. A study by researchers at Wuhan University introduces a groundbreaking method that integrates inter-satellite link (ISL) data with onboard BeiDou-3 (BDS-3) observations. This technique simultaneously determines the orbits of both LEO and BDS-3 Medium Earth Orbit (MEO) satellites, correcting systematic constellation rotation by referencing the coordinate system implied in BDS-3 broadcast ephemerides. Published in <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2667096821000015" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Satellite Navigation</a>, the study demonstrates the method's ability to achieve centimeter-level precision, a significant leap forward in satellite navigation technology.</p><p>Modern satellite mega-constellations, such as OneWeb, Starlink, and CENTISPACETM, are designed to offer global communications and navigation services. However, the precise orbit determination (POD) of these satellites has traditionally relied on extensive ground station networks, which are not only costly but also limited by geopolitical and geographical constraints. The new method developed by the Wuhan University researchers leverages ISLs and onboard GNSS capabilities to reduce dependency on ground stations, presenting a scalable and efficient solution for real-time applications.</p><p>In their study, the researchers simulated a 66-satellite LEO constellation equipped with ISLs and onboard BDS-3 receivers, alongside 24 real BDS-3 MEO satellites. By applying a Helmert transformation to correct the orbits based on rotation angles derived from the BeiDou Coordinate System, they observed a dramatic reduction in orbit errors. This method's effectiveness was evident even when only a subset of the constellation carried GNSS receivers, underscoring its potential for widespread application in future satellite networks.</p><p>Dr. Kecai Jiang, the study's corresponding author, emphasized the method's capability to address the persistent challenge of systematic rotation in autonomous constellation orbit determination. By utilizing existing BDS-3 broadcast ephemerides and inter-satellite measurements, this approach provides high-accuracy navigation services without the need for post-processed GNSS products or extensive ground infrastructure. This innovation not only improves the resilience and scalability of satellite navigation systems but also reduces operational costs, representing a critical development for the integration of LEO constellations with existing GNSS systems.</p><p>The implications of this research are vast, extending beyond navigation to potential benefits in global communication, disaster response, and precision agriculture. By facilitating more accurate and autonomous satellite operations, the rotation-corrected integrated POD method signifies a major advancement in satellite technology and its applications worldwide.</p>
