<p>Greenwave Technology Solutions Inc. (NASDAQ: GWAV) has received an additional delinquency notice from Nasdaq following the delayed filing of its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended June 30, 2025. This regulatory setback affects the metal recycling company that operates 13 facilities across Virginia, North Carolina, and Ohio through its subsidiary Empire Services, Inc.</p><p>The Nasdaq notice could serve as an additional basis for delisting the company's securities from the exchange. However, Greenwave emphasized that its stock will continue trading on The Nasdaq Capital Market under the ticker "GWAV" while the company works to resolve the compliance issues. The company confirmed plans to provide Nasdaq with an updated compliance plan by September 8, 2025, and stated it is working diligently to complete and file its delayed reports with the SEC as soon as practicable.</p><p>This delinquency notice represents ongoing regulatory challenges for Greenwave, which operates in the critical metal recycling sector. The company implements several unique technologies to increase metal processing volumes and operating efficiencies, including a downstream recovery system and cloud-based ERP system. Steel recycling, a core part of Greenwave's business, provides significant environmental benefits over virgin metals, including reduced energy use, lower CO2 emissions, and conservation of natural resources.</p><p>The company's customers include large corporations, industrial manufacturers, retail customers, and government organizations. Despite the current compliance issues, Greenwave has previously announced plans to aggressively expand its footprint by acquiring independent, profitable scrap yards in the coming months. For additional information about the company, investors can visit <a href="https://www.GWAV.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.GWAV.com</a>.</p><p>The latest regulatory development underscores the importance of timely financial reporting for publicly traded companies, particularly those in environmentally focused industries where investor confidence is crucial for funding expansion and technological innovation. The situation will be closely watched by investors and industry observers as the September 8 deadline for the compliance plan approaches.</p>
