<p>The latest episode of Go Fund Yourself featured two startups addressing critical gaps in today's digital landscape: MOTI's instant monetization platform for professional video consultations and Observe Life's privacy-focused digital memory preservation service. Both companies presented their business models to investors Rory Cutaia, David Meltzer, and Jayson Waller during the business pitch show.</p><p>MOTI positions itself as the Uber for knowledge by enabling professionals to host video calls with instant per-minute payments. The app targets coaches, consultants, mentors, and creators seeking to monetize their expertise without relying on traditional invoicing or subscription models. This approach addresses fragmentation in the $100-billion-plus knowledge economy where demand exists but revenue capture remains inefficient. Investors are particularly interested in MOTI's potential to scale marketplace take-rates and establish standardized professional-to-consumer video interactions despite competition from established platforms.</p><p>Observe Life offers a contrasting solution focused on digital legacy preservation outside social media's data economy. The platform allows families and institutions to collaborate on secure timelines and construct multi-generational digital storylines starting at $3.99 monthly. What makes Observe Life stand out to investors is its dual revenue approach combining consumer subscriptions with institutional licensing agreements targeting weddings, retirement communities, and event venues. The company's emphasis on successor permissions, private ownership features, and data security directly responds to growing consumer concerns about privacy and digital permanence.</p><p>The simultaneous presentation of these companies underscores significant market shifts toward real-time expertise monetization and private digital memory solutions. MOTI represents the evolving time-is-money economy where professionals seek immediate compensation for their knowledge, while Observe Life addresses increasing demand for alternatives to tech giants' data practices. Both startups operate in rapidly changing sectors where monetization models and data ownership paradigms are being redefined.</p><p>Viewers can watch the episode on <a href="https://www.cheddar.com/shows/go-fund-yourself/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Cheddar TV</a> or access replays through the platform.
