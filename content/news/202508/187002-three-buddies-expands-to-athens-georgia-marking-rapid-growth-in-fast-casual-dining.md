<p>Three Buddies, the fast-casual dining concept redefining comfort food with a creative twist, has announced the official grand opening of its newest location in Athens, Georgia. The expansion represents the latest milestone for the brand, which has opened three thriving locations in less than a year under the leadership of restaurateur Peter Anand and Managing Partner Tia Jakes.</p><p>The restaurant concept, launched in May 2024, has quickly distinguished itself with its Certified Angus Beef burgers, widely regarded as some of Atlanta's best, alongside a diverse menu that blends comfort and creativity. Anand emphasized the brand's philosophy, stating that Three Buddies was built on the idea that food should be both comforting and exciting, values that align with the Athens community's appreciation for flavor, experience, and togetherness.</p><p>At the heart of Three Buddies' rapid success is Tia Jakes, who brings more than 26 years of diverse experience in the restaurant, hospitality, and event planning industries. Jakes plays an instrumental role in ensuring the brand's consistent growth and efficiency, having developed expertise in opening restaurants and designing operational processes. She also leads business planning for <a href="https://yourfifthquarter.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Your Fifth Quarter, LLC</a>, a premier Atlanta-based restaurant management company.</p><p>Jakes described Three Buddies as more than a restaurant, calling it a lifestyle brand built on vision, consistency, and community. She expressed commitment to making the Athens location a cornerstone of the neighborhood, reflecting the brand's focus on delivering exceptional food and a seamless guest experience.</p><p>Anand's entrepreneurial background extends beyond hospitality to include significant achievements in engineering and business. He joined Canterbury Engineering in 1988, rising from machine operator to VP of Operations and driving sales from $8 million to $120 million in just three years. Later, he founded Joe Tools in 2009, scaling the design and engineering startup to $30 million in annual sales before selling it in 2023 for $16 million.</p><p>With the Athens location now operational, Anand and Jakes plan to expand the Three Buddies brand through franchising while exploring new ventures. The leadership team remains focused on creating long-term opportunities for growth and sustainability, balancing their passion for business with commitment to family and community.</p>
