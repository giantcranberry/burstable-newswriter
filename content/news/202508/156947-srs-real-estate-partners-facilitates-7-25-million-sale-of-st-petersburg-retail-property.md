<p>SRS Real Estate Partners recently announced the completion of a $7.25 million off-market sale involving a two-parcel, multi-tenant retail property located at 730 4th Street N in St. Petersburg, FL. Constructed in 2009, the property encompasses 10,802 square feet and is fully leased to a diverse mix of national and local tenants, including Foxtail Coffee, UPS, Jimmy Johnâ€™s, Chipotle, and Verizon. This transaction highlights the continued strong demand for retail properties in affluent, high-traffic areas.</p><p>The sale was orchestrated by SRS Capital Markets Senior Managing Principal Patrick Nutt and Executive Vice President & Principal William Wamble, who acted on behalf of the Tampa-based investment group selling the property. The buyer, a national fund with a specific interest in multi-tenant retail properties, was identified by the SRS team as the perfect fit for this off-market opportunity. Wamble pointed out that the property's prime location on 4th Street, a major artery into downtown St. Petersburg with approximately 25,000 vehicles passing daily, combined with its robust tenant roster, significantly enhanced its appeal to investors.</p><p>This transaction is a testament to SRS Capital Markets' active role in the commercial real estate sector, having surpassed $1.2 billion in deal volume this year across more than 350 transactions nationwide. At present, SRS boasts over 845 properties listed for sale, with a total market value surpassing $3.7 billion.
