<p>ESGold Corp. has entered into a binding memorandum of understanding with Planta Magdalena S.A.S. for a fully permitted gold and silver project in Colombia's Department of Bolívar. The agreement establishes a joint venture where ESGold will invest C$1.5 million for a 50% interest, with an option to acquire the remaining 50% stake within 12 months at fair market value.</p><p>The Colombian project represents a significant strategic expansion for ESGold, providing the company with a rare near-term production opportunity outside of its primary operations. With production permits already secured, the partnership eliminates the lengthy regulatory approval process typically associated with mining projects, allowing for accelerated development timelines. This venture complements ESGold's existing Montauban project in Quebec, positioning the company with multiple production assets across different jurisdictions.</p><p>The joint venture leverages modern technological approaches to extract value from legacy mine waste, representing an innovative approach to resource recovery. This methodology aligns with ESGold's focus on clean mining and sustainable resource development practices. The company's expertise in Quebec, where it has established itself as a preproduction resource company at the forefront of mining innovation, will be applied to optimize operations at the Colombian site.</p><p>Financial details of the arrangement include the initial C$1.5 million investment for the 50% stake, with the option structure providing flexibility for full acquisition based on project performance and market conditions. The 12-month option window allows ESGold to evaluate the project's potential before committing to complete ownership. This staged approach mitigates investment risk while securing access to valuable mineral assets.</p><p>The project's location in Colombia's Department of Bolívar places it within a region known for mineral wealth, particularly gold and silver deposits. The existing permits cover both extraction and processing operations, providing comprehensive operational authority. Additional information about ESGold's corporate developments and project updates is available through the company's newsroom at <a href="https://nnw.fm/ESAUF" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://nnw.fm/ESAUF</a>.</p><p>This development comes as ESGold continues to advance its flagship Montauban property, located 80 kilometers west of Quebec City, which serves as a model for responsible mining practices combining production with discovery potential. The joint venture represents a strategic diversification of ESGold's asset portfolio while maintaining the company's commitment to sustainable mining practices and technological innovation in resource recovery.</p>
