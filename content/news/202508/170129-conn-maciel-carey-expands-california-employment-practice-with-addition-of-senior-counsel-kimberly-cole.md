Cole brings more than two decades of specialized experience in California employment law, strengthening the firm's capabilities in a jurisdiction known for its complex and rapidly evolving workplace regulations.</p><p>Cole's practice encompasses comprehensive employment law representation, including wage and hour disputes from audits through compliance and defense of individual, class action, and PAGA claims. She has extensive experience defending clients against discrimination, retaliation, and whistleblower claims through all stages of litigation, from initial demand through jury trial. Her background includes representation before administrative agencies and appellate courts, providing clients with full-spectrum legal support.</p><p>Kara M. Maciel, Chair of CMC's Labor and Employment Practice Group, emphasized the strategic importance of this addition, noting that having someone of Kimberly's caliber who has a sharp legal insight and deep understanding of California's labor and employment law is a tremendous asset to our team and to our clients in that region. The firm's California Practice Chair, Rachel L. Conn, highlighted Cole's track record of achieving favorable outcomes in diverse and complex employment matters.</p><p>Cole's appointment comes at a time when California employers face increasing regulatory complexity and enforcement activity.
