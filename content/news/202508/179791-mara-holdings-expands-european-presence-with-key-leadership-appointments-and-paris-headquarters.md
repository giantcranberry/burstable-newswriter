<p>MARA Holdings has announced significant steps in its European expansion strategy with the appointment of Gérard Mestrallet as Senior Advisor and François Garcin as General Manager of Europe, alongside establishing Paris as its new European headquarters. These developments represent a strategic move to position the company within Europe's evolving energy ecosystem and accelerate its international growth initiatives.</p><p>Fred Thiel, MARA's Chairman and CEO, emphasized the importance of these appointments, stating that Mestrallet's industry experience and Garcin's track record in finance and technology will advance the company's impact in Europe. The leadership changes come as MARA seeks to power inference at the edge worldwide through structured joint ventures and global partnerships, leveraging Europe's position as a critical growth market for digital energy technologies.</p><p>Mestrallet brings decades of experience in global energy and infrastructure sectors, having served as Chairman and CEO of ENGIE for over 20 years. His current role as Special Envoy appointed by French President Emmanuel Macron for the India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor, combined with his extensive board experience with major corporations including Siemens, AXA, and Credit Agricole, positions him uniquely to guide MARA's European strategy. Mestrallet stated his intention to help consolidate the strategic alliance between the United States and France while aligning MARA's computing technologies with European energy resources across multiple regions.</p><p>Garcin, who joined MARA in July, has already played an instrumental role in forming MARA France and MARA Europe, including securing the company's recent investment agreement with Exaion. With more than 20 years of experience in finance and technology, Garcin has closed multimillion-dollar deals spanning the U.S., Europe, and Asia through his previous role as founder of Argenthal Holdings. As General Manager of Europe, he will oversee operations from the new Paris headquarters and work to establish new joint ventures with leading European energy companies.</p><p>The convergence of artificial intelligence and energy presents significant opportunities in Europe, and MARA's expansion reflects the growing importance of digital energy technologies in balancing grid operations and reducing energy demands for high-performance computing applications. The company's focus on transforming excess energy into digital capital while developing technologies that support AI and edge computing applications positions it at the forefront of energy innovation. The European headquarters in France will serve as the foundation for MARA's next chapter of growth, enabling closer collaboration with European energy majors and facilitating the company's global partnership strategy.</p>
