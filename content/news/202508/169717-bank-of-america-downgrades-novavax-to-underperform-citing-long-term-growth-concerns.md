<p>Bank of America has downgraded Novavax to Underperform from Neutral, citing significant concerns about the vaccine manufacturer's long-term growth potential despite recent operational improvements. The financial institution also reduced its price target for Novavax shares to $7 from $9, reflecting growing skepticism about the company's ability to sustain growth in the post-pandemic market.</p><p>Analysts acknowledged that Novavax has demonstrated strong execution in recent quarters, successfully reducing operating expenses by approximately two-thirds from pandemic-era peaks and strengthening its balance sheet. However, they emphasized that fundamental growth drivers remain uncertain and potentially limited. The primary concern centers on demand for Novavax's COVID-19 vaccine, Nuvaxovid, which targets the JN.1 variant while the currently dominant circulating strain is NB.1.8.1.</p><p>The regulatory landscape presents additional challenges under the <a href="https://www.fda.gov" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Food and Drug Administration</a>'s updated vaccine framework, which requires more rigorous and costly clinical trials as new viral strains emerge. These heightened requirements could necessitate new clinical studies for Novavax's products, increasing development costs and complicating the path to market approval. The regulatory pressure may also affect potential partnerships for Novavax's experimental COVID-19/influenza combination vaccine candidate, which represents a key component of the company's pipeline focus.</p><p>While Novavax has experienced some short-term benefits from funding reductions affecting certain mRNA competitors, Bank of America analysts believe these advantages are temporary and insufficient to support sustainable long-term growth. The company's shares have exhibited significant volatility throughout the year as investors attempt to balance Novavax's cost-cutting successes against the narrowing opportunities for expansion in an evolving vaccine market. The downgrade reflects growing analyst consensus that despite operational improvements, structural challenges in demand and regulatory requirements may limit Novavax's ability to achieve consistent growth moving forward.</p>
