<p>A Louisiana district court has delivered a significant ruling that invalidates arbitration and delegation clauses in residential sale contracts, establishing important consumer protections for homeowners. In Dixon, et al. v. D.R. Horton, et al., the 19th Judicial District Court found three fatal flaws in the builder's contract that rendered both arbitration and delegation clauses unenforceable.</p><p>The court determined that arbitration clauses referencing "AAA Construction Industry Arbitration Rules" are unenforceable when the contract fails to define "AAA" or provide the actual rules to lay homeowners. The builder's contract referred to the "AAA" without writing out "American Arbitration Association" or explaining what the acronym meant. Furthermore, there was no evidence that the builder provided homeowners with a copy of the actual arbitration rules, leaving them without understanding the procedures they were agreeing to.</p><p>The delegation clause, which would have allowed an arbitrator rather than the court to decide threshold issues of arbitrability, was also deemed unenforceable. The court held that merely incorporating delegation provisions by reference to external rules like those of the <a href="https://www.adr.org" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">American Arbitration Association</a> does not constitute "clear and unmistakable" evidence of the parties' intent to delegate such issues. This is particularly true when dealing with lay consumers who lack industry knowledge and when the rules are neither explained nor provided.</p><p>Additionally, the court found the contract contained numerous one-sided provisions that favored the builder without extending reciprocal rights to homeowners. The builder retained unilateral rights to terminate the contract based on "a bona fide dispute," access to liquidated damages and attorney's fees, and the ability to terminate if homeowners attempted to record the contract in public recordsâ€”none of which were available to the homeowners. The court ruled these provisions unconscionable and inequitable due to their lack of mutuality.</p><p>This decision underscores the judicial scrutiny applied to arbitration and delegation clauses in consumer transactions where parties have unequal bargaining power. It emphasizes the requirement for clear, mutually agreed-upon contract terms and proper disclosure of external documents referenced in agreements. The ruling provides important guidance for contract formation and mutual assent principles, particularly in standard form contracts used in residential transactions.</p><p>The case, which arose from a class action alleging construction defects in homes built and sold by the defendant builder, is currently being appealed. However, the trial court's decision immediately impacts how builders and contractors must structure their residential sale agreements to ensure enforceability and fairness to consumers.</p>
