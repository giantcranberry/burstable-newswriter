<p>Custom Health, Inc., a vertically integrated, tech-enabled care platform, has acquired PatchRx, Inc., a medication adherence and remote monitoring technology company, to enhance its outcomes-driven medication programs. The acquisition enables prescription medication dispensing with real-time insights to improve care for patients managing chronic conditions while lowering healthcare costs.</p><p>PatchRx's patented <a href="https://patchrx.com/technology" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PatchCap smart pill bottle cap technology</a> is used in clinics and pharmacies across the U.S. to remotely monitor and improve patient adherence. The technology's seamless integration of software and hardware enables real-time visibility into medication compliance, allowing patients to manage their medicines more effectively and clinicians to intervene before issues occur.</p><p>Shane Bishop, CEO of Custom Health, stated that the future of outcomes-driven medication programs lies in connectivity and data interoperability. "Nearly 60% of adults have a chronic physical or mental health condition and an estimated 40% of adults have two or more," Bishop noted. "Integrating PatchRx technology into our AdhereNetÂ® platform enhances our ability to monitor adherence in real time and take swift action to support patients and improve outcomes."</p><p>The acquisition brings PatchRx's medication adherence technology under Custom Health's connected care platform of vertically integrated, end-to-end patient care solutions. PatchRx's co-founders Andrew Aertker and Gavin Buchanan, along with key employees, will join Custom Health to advance the mission to connect patients, providers, and payors through real-time data, connected dispensing, and personalized engagement.</p><p>Aertker, CEO of PatchRx, emphasized that their strategy is about more than hardware and dashboards. "It's about giving providers visibility into medication adherence where they previously had none," he said. "By joining Custom Health, we're embedding that visibility directly into the end-to-end care process at nationwide scale while complementing their proven model of technology-enabled patient outcomes management."</p><p>Bishop added that the PatchCap technology is particularly valuable for monitoring patients taking pain medications, especially opioids prescribed for as-needed use to treat breakthrough pain. This transaction supports Custom Health's strategic focus on the significant market opportunity and pressing need in pain management. The integration addresses the critical gap between prescribed treatment and actual medication adherence behaviors, which is essential for improving healthcare outcomes across chronic disease management.</p>
