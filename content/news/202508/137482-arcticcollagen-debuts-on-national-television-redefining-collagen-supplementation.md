<p>ArcticCollagen, a health and wellness brand, has recently made its television debut, marking a significant milestone in its mission to revolutionize collagen supplementation. The brand's innovative product, a marine collagen dietary supplement, was featured on The Donna Drake Show, showcasing its unique blend of 8,000 mg of hydrolyzed marine collagen, 8 grams of lean protein, hyaluronic acid, and Vitamin C in flavored sachets. This development underscores the brand's commitment to providing a superior alternative to existing collagen products, with a focus on quality, sustainability, and convenience.</p><p>Founded in 2024 by Jasmien Winqvist and Lennart Winqvist, ArcticCollagen was developed out of dissatisfaction with the current market offerings.
