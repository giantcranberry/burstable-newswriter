<p>Black Duck Software, Inc. has unveiled significant upgrades to its AI-powered application security assistant, Black Duck Assist, now seamlessly integrated into the Code Sight IDE plugin. This innovation is set to transform the landscape of software development by providing real-time scanning and remediation of security vulnerabilities within the developer's workflow, particularly in code generated by AI assistants.</p><p>The integration facilitates automatic scanning of code as it is written or generated by AI coding assistants, such as GitHub CoPilot and Claude Code, identifying potential security risks and intellectual property issues at the earliest stages. This proactive approach to security is underscored by Gartner's recognition of the critical role that generative AI and security tools like Black Duck Assist play in balancing coding efficiency with security integrity.</p><p>Code Sight's compatibility extends beyond conventional IDEs like Eclipse, IntelliJ, and Visual Studio to include AI code editors such as Cursor and Windsurf. This broadens the scope for developers to safely utilize AI-generated code. Additionally, the introduction of natural language query support in both the IDE and the Polaris platform enhances accessibility to project data and insights into product functionality, streamlining the development process.</p><p>Dipto Chakravarty, Chief Product and Technology Officer at Black Duck, highlighted the company's commitment to harnessing AI to bolster product security and developer productivity. These enhancements are designed to enable developers to generate secure, compliant code more efficiently by embedding security measures directly into their development environments.</p><p>For more information, visit <a href='https://www.blackducksoftware.com' rel='nofollow' target='_blank'>https://www.blackducksoftware.com</a> or watch the Black Duck Assist video. The upgraded Black Duck Assist in Code Sight will be featured at the Black Hat Conference in Las Vegas on August 6-7, 2025, at booth #5242.</p>
