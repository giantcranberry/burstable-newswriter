<p>Ocean Networks, Inc. has selected global cable solutions provider Prysmian and submarine cable engineering specialist IT International Telecom for the development of its Hawaiian Islands Fiber Link (HIFL) project. This collaboration represents a major advancement in Hawaii's broadband expansion efforts, directly supporting the state's <a href="https://connectkakou.org" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Connect Kākou</a> initiative to improve digital connectivity throughout the islands.</p><p>The HIFL project will feature approximately 740 kilometers of state-of-the-art submarine cable supplied by Prysmian, while IT International Telecom will provide essential engineering and installation services. David Blau, Chief Operating Officer of Ocean Networks, emphasized that securing these contracts marks a major step forward in the construction timeline for bringing improved connectivity to Hawaii's residents, businesses, education institutions, and government entities.</p><p>Davide Taddei, Submarine Telecom Business Director at Prysmian, highlighted the project's significance in today's interconnected world, noting that ensuring secure and resilient digital infrastructure is critical. Prysmian's solutions are designed not only for performance and durability but also to support enhanced digital security and data integrity for the communities they serve. The company brings extensive experience from challenging submarine environments worldwide to this Pacific infrastructure project.</p><p>Steve Arsenault, Vice President of Sales & Marketing at IT International Telecom, expressed pride in contributing to Hawaii's telecommunications infrastructure, building on the company's long history of successful project delivery within the Hawaiian Islands. The HIFL system will be a carrier-neutral, open-access infrastructure with landing sites on Oʻahu, Hawaiʻi, Maui, Kauaʻi, Lānaʻi, and Molokaʻi, featuring 24 fiber pairs with a design life of 25 years.</p><p>Scheduled for completion in late 2026, the project is partially funded by a grant from the U.S. Treasury Department's Capital Projects Fund, with additional private funding secured by Ocean Networks. The University of Hawai'i System Office for Information Technology oversees the project with support from the Research Corporation of the University of Hawaiʻi. This infrastructure development addresses the growing need for reliable, high-speed internet access across Hawaii's geographically dispersed islands, potentially transforming digital accessibility for residents and businesses throughout the state.</p>
