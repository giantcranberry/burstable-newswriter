The company's financial health was strengthened by an increase in cash and equivalents, reaching $8.2 million by the quarter's end, with $24.2 million available as of August 8, 2025, thanks to ATM share sales.</p><p>Key achievements for Knightscope during this quarter include the complete repayment of a $3 million senior secured note and securing a lease for a new 33,355-square-foot headquarters in Sunnyvale, Calif. These steps highlight the company's dedication to expanding its operational capabilities and improving production efficiency. Moreover, Knightscope experienced a 7% year-over-year growth in recurring service revenue, indicating a rising demand for its security solutions.</p><p>Focusing on innovation, Knightscope has invested in the K7 platform, AI analytics, and the development of next-generation products.
