<p>Propanc Biopharma, Inc. has completed a $4 million underwritten public offering, selling 1,000,000 shares of common stock at $4.00 per share. This capital infusion provides critical funding for the company's innovative cancer research program focused on preventing recurrence and metastasis of solid tumors through pancreatic proenzyme therapy. The offering, which traded on the Nasdaq Capital Market from August 15 to August 18, 2025, included an additional 45-day option for the underwriter to purchase up to 150,000 extra shares.</p><p>The funding represents a significant advancement in cancer treatment research, particularly for patients with pancreatic, ovarian, and colorectal cancers. Propanc's approach specifically targets cancer stem cells, which are widely recognized as the primary drivers of tumor recurrence and metastasisâ€”two of the most challenging aspects of cancer treatment. Conventional therapies often fail to eliminate these resilient cells, leading to disease progression despite initial treatment success.</p><p>The scientific foundation of Propanc's therapy leverages the biological activity of pancreatic enzymes, which the company identifies as the body's primary defense mechanism against cancer development. By harnessing these natural enzymes, the research aims to develop a novel treatment approach that could complement existing cancer therapies and improve long-term patient outcomes.

This financial backing enables continued research into a treatment modality that addresses the fundamental challenge of cancer recurrence, potentially offering new therapeutic options for patients with aggressive solid tumors that frequently resist conventional treatments. The involvement of D. Boral Capital LLC and Craft Capital Management LLC as book running managers ensured the successful execution of this financial initiative.</p>
