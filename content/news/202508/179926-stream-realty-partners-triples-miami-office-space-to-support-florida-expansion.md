<p>Stream Realty Partners has secured a long-term lease for approximately 8,000 square feet on the 30th floor of Citigroup Center at 201 S. Biscayne Blvd. in Downtown Miami, tripling the firm's Miami footprint to accommodate its rapid Florida growth. The new office space will serve as the strategic hub for Stream's Miami operations and house over 50 professionals across multiple service lines, including tenant representation, landlord representation, capital markets, property management, construction management, and workplace strategy in both office and industrial sectors.</p><p>The expansion represents a major milestone in Stream's Florida growth story, with the firm expected to move into the new space in the first quarter of 2026. Greg Katz, Executive Managing Director and Partner at Stream, stated that the decision reflects the momentum the company has built in Florida and its commitment to staying at the forefront of the market. The growth experienced is directly attributable to Stream's collaborative culture and entrepreneurial spirit, which attracts both clients and top talent.</p><p>Since launching in 2023, Stream Florida has grown from just six team members to more than 45 professionals across Miami, Tampa, and Orlando. The group continues to attract top-tier talent from some of the industry's largest global competitors while scaling its service capabilities. Shay Pope, Managing Director and Executive Vice President at Stream, emphasized that the firm's ability to recruit the best talent, launch new service lines, and compete at the highest level results from Stream's unique culture and reputation for delivering results.</p><p>Stream's Florida platform has strategically expanded over the last 18 months to offer fully integrated services across the state. The firm launched its Industrial Services division in early 2025, led by Managing Directors and Executive Vice Presidents Steve Medwin and Nick Wigoda, who brought more than 6.1 million square feet of industrial leasing assignments in South Florida. In the second quarter of 2025, Stream added Property Management as a service line, further demonstrating its commitment to providing comprehensive solutions to clients.

This expansion signals strong confidence in Florida's commercial real estate market and underscores the state's continued attractiveness for business investment and growth, potentially influencing other commercial real estate firms to expand their Florida operations and reinforcing the state's position as a major business hub.</p>
