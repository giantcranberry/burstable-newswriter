<p>One World Products, Inc. has announced a major expansion of its Eco Bio Plastics division through a toll compounding agreement with Full Circle Technologies, enabling the company to process tens of thousands of pounds of renewable materials weekly. The partnership represents a strategic move to capture market share in the global packaging industry valued at more than $1 trillion annually.</p><p>The agreement allows Eco Bio Plastics Michigan to begin processing approximately 40,000 pounds per week, with plans to double production to 80,000 pounds within two months and ultimately reach up to 160,000 pounds weekly as operations scale. The company processes various renewable materials including rubber, cellulose, hemp, and other bio-feedstocks using advanced pelletizing, pulverizing, and micronizing technologies.</p><p>This expansion builds on the company's previous achievement in October 2024 when it secured its first order of 1,400 hemp-based reusable containers to Flex-N-Gate, validating its ability to integrate renewable solutions into mainstream automotive supply chains. The multi-material processing capability distinguishes the company from competitors tied to single feedstocks, providing flexibility to meet diverse market demands across automotive, industrial, and food packaging sectors.</p><p>The timing of this expansion coincides with increasing regulatory and market pressure to replace petroleum-based plastics with renewable alternatives. The company's growing network of partners includes industry leaders such as Stellantis, Flex-N-Gate, ORBIS Corporation, and West Michigan Compounding, all working to advance circular economy principles where waste streams are transformed into sustainable resources.</p><p>Isiah Thomas, Chairman and CEO of One World Products, emphasized the strategic positioning at the intersection of automotive and food packaging markets. The company's technical capabilities and established relationships with original equipment manufacturers and suppliers provide a competitive advantage in one of the world's fastest-growing industries focused on sustainability and renewable materials.</p>
