<p>CollectionPro has introduced a guaranteed approach to healthcare collections that ensures 100% recovery of out-of-network claims through Independent Dispute Resolution under the No Surprises Act. The company's zero-risk model eliminates arbitration and administrative fees, requiring providers to pay only when claims are successfully recovered, fundamentally transforming how healthcare facilities manage denied or underpaid claims.</p><p>The company's expansion into California follows successful implementations in states including Florida and New York, addressing a critical need among providers struggling with payer underpayments and complex reimbursement structures. CollectionPro's model features an industry-low 10% success-based fee and handles claims up to 365 days old from any facility or provider type, covering Medicare, Medicaid, Medi-Cal, and all commercial payers.</p><p>Central to CollectionPro's offering is their team of NSA specialist attorneys who have handled over 10,000 arbitrations with a 92% success rate. The company promises to deliver five times the amount typically offered by payers, providing a crucial financial lifeline to practices that traditionally receive only up to 50% reimbursement for out-of-network services. This approach ensures providers receive fair compensation without the burden of endless disputes and hidden fees that have historically plagued healthcare collections.</p><p>The company's comprehensive service includes claim scrubbing, refiling, and arbitration at no additional cost, coupled with detailed weekly and on-demand reporting for complete transparency. This technological integration with legal expertise represents a significant shift from traditional aggressive collections to smart, compliant recovery methods that align with current regulatory requirements under the <a href="https://www.cms.gov/nosurprises" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">No Surprises Act guidelines</a>.</p><p>California healthcare providers, particularly affected by payer tactics that delay or deny rightful reimbursements, stand to benefit significantly from this solution. CollectionPro's model empowers providers with legal recourse and guaranteed claim recovery, preventing vulnerability to payer-controlled negotiations while ensuring regulatory compliance throughout the dispute resolution process.</p>
