<p>Two elite advisory teams from Morgan Stanley and Merrill Lynch have combined their practices to form Longleaf Capital Group, an independent wealth management firm with more than $2 billion in assets under advisement on the <a href="https://arkadioscapital.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Arkadios Capital</a> platform. The six founding directors bring over 175 years of combined experience across wealth management, institutional investing, accounting, banking and insurance.</p><p>Their decision to unite coming from competing global wirehouses reflects a growing national trend of top advisors leaving large banks in favor of the independence and flexibility of the hybrid RIA model. This movement signals a fundamental shift in the wealth management industry, where experienced professionals are increasingly choosing entrepreneurial independence over traditional corporate structures.</p><p>Jonathan D. Lee, Managing Director of Longleaf Capital Group, stated that by joining forces, the team has combined complementary expertise in wealth management, personal financial planning, tax planning, institutional retirement planning and estate planning strategies under one roof. This consolidation of specialized knowledge creates a comprehensive service offering that addresses the complex financial needs of high-net-worth clients through multiple market cycles.</p><p>Based in Dothan, Alabama, Longleaf Capital Group offers full-service capabilities including financial and retirement planning, institutional retirement plan consulting, estate and tax strategies, alternative investments, insurance solutions, liquidity event planning and philanthropic advisory. The team includes two former CPAs, four Certified Financial Planner professionals and specialists with advanced designations in institutional retirement plans, estate planning and tax optimization.</p><p>Arkadios Capital provides the infrastructure and resources that enable the team to operate as entrepreneurs while still offering institutional-quality tools and support for clients. David Millican, CEO of Arkadios Capital, noted that this represents the kind of high-caliber team and unique founding story that doesn't happen often in the industry. The partnership positions Longleaf Capital Group to deliver truly comprehensive services to clients at the highest level.</p><p>Arkadios Capital, which partners with some of the world's leading investment managers to deliver an institutional-quality platform tailored to private wealth clients, has been recognized as one of the fastest-growing companies in Georgia. The firm has earned a spot on the prestigious Association for Corporate Growth Georgia Fast 40 list for four consecutive years and is consistently ranked by Financial Planning and Investment News as one of the top independent broker-dealers in the country.
