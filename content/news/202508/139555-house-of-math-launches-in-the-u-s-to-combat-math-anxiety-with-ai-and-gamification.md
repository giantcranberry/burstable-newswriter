<p>House of Math, Norway's leading math education technology platform, has officially entered the U.S. market, introducing an innovative solution to math anxiety among students. Founded by Vibeke Gwendoline Faengsrud, whose personal struggle with math inspired the platform, House of Math leverages gamified learning and artificial intelligence to tailor math education for K-12 learners. This expansion is timely, addressing the U.S. education system's challenges with declining math scores and the aftermath of pandemic-induced learning disruptions.</p><p>The platform distinguishes itself through animated video lessons, interactive games, and The Oracle, an AI-powered tool designed to pinpoint and bridge knowledge gaps. Faengsrud's journey from math failure to holding a master's degree in mathematical finance embodies the platform's mission to transform math from a stress-inducing subject into one of confidence and mastery. With a proven track record in Scandinavia, where it has aided millions of students, House of Math is set to replicate its success in the U.S.</p><p>User testimonials, including those from Anders, a parent and former NHL player, and Lisa, a student who saw her grades rise from a D to an A, highlight the platform's impact. Anders praised the platform for being <a href='https://houseofmath.com' rel='nofollow' target='_blank'>fun and level-appropriate</a>, while Lisa credited it for boosting her confidence across subjects. Offering both free and premium options nationwide, House of Math not only meets a critical educational need but also breaks stereotypes in STEM, with Faengsrud standing as a female pioneer in tech.</p>
