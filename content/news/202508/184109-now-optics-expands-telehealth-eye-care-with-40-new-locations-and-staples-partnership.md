<p>Now Optics, one of America's fastest-growing vision care companies, is expanding its telehealth-enabled eye care model with plans to open 40 new locations next year and a strategic partnership with Staples that will bring optical services to retail environments. The expansion leverages technology to address accessibility challenges in vision care, particularly in remote communities where eye care professionals are scarce.</p><p>Founded in 2006 by CEO Daniel Stanton, Now Optics has grown from a single location to over 300 stores across 32 states, serving millions of patients through a combination of retail stores, telehealth-enabled eye exams, and an integrated e-commerce platform. The company's telehealth platform, first launched in 2016, has been particularly transformative, with affiliated doctors performing over 4 million telehealth-enabled eye exams that automate routine elements to allow more time for in-depth diagnostics and personalized care.</p><p>The upcoming expansion includes a novel partnership with Staples, where Stanton Optical will establish store-in-store locations at select Staples stores beginning in Fall 2025 in Pennsylvania. This represents a significant shift in how optical services are delivered, bringing vision care directly to consumers in familiar retail environments. Stanton attributes the company's growth to addressing fundamental consumer frustrations with traditional optical care, including limited choices, high prices, and long wait times.</p><p>The industry is undergoing rapid transformation as consumers increasingly expect convenience and quick access to care. Telehealth eye exams, same-day glasses, and technology-driven innovations are reshaping how patients experience vision care. Now Optics has positioned itself at the forefront of this shift as the largest founder-owned and operated eye care platform in the U.S., providing full-service care that combines retail, manufacturing, telehealth, and technology under one roof.</p><p>Looking ahead, Stanton identifies two key trends driving the industry's evolution: the continued growth of telehealth and the emergence of smart eyewear. Telehealth has proven effective in making eye care more convenient and accessible, especially in areas with shortages of eye care professionals. Meanwhile, smart eyewear featuring light-responsive lenses, real-time translation, and health tracking capabilities is transitioning from novelty to everyday use, blending style with function in ways that make eyewear more than just a vision tool.</p><p>The expansion and partnership initiatives demonstrate how technology-enabled vision care models are addressing critical accessibility issues while meeting evolving consumer expectations for convenience and comprehensive services. This approach not only streamlines visits and shortens wait times but also expands access by connecting customers with doctors more quickly regardless of location.</p>
