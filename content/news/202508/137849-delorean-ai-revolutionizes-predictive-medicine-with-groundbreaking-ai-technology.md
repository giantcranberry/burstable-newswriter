<p>Dr. Severence MacLaughlin, CEO of DeLorean AI, has pioneered the integration of artificial intelligence into healthcare, focusing on predictive medicine to not only innovate but also save lives. Over six and a half years, DeLorean AI has transitioned from a concept to a scalable company, achieving biologically validated predictions in chronic disease care, showcasing the transformative potential of AI in healthcare.</p><p>A landmark achievement for DeLorean AI was its technology's superior performance when applied to Salesforce CRM, outperforming Salesforce's own AI 90% of the time. This milestone underscored the company's groundbreaking advancements in AI. Further validation came when DeLorean AI's Medical AI product identified Chronic Kidney Disease patients five years earlier than traditional methods, with predictions independently confirmed by UnitedHealthcare and Innovative Renal Care.</p><p>The impact of DeLorean AI's technology is quantifiable, with hospitalizations reduced by 50% within 90 days when their recommendations are followed. This not only demonstrates the efficacy of their solutions but also translates into nearly $1 billion in savings for insurers and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, highlighting the financial benefits alongside health improvements.</p><p>Despite the healthcare sector's traditional resistance to new technologies, DeLorean AI has successfully targeted smaller, mid-market companies more receptive to innovation. MacLaughlin's bootstrapping approach has fostered a culture of discipline and frugality, driving the company forward with a clear mission. Looking to the future, MacLaughlin aims for DeLorean AI to set the gold standard for quality in AI, similar to Intel's role in computing, with a focus on extending lives and enhancing health outcomes.</p><p>For more information on DeLorean AI's innovative solutions, visit <a href="https://www.deloreanai.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.deloreanai.com</a>.</p>
