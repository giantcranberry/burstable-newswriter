<p>Code Ninjas has established a new learning center in Seattle's Queen Anne neighborhood, providing children aged 5-14 with an innovative approach to computer coding education through video game development. Located at 513 1st Ave. West, #B, the facility officially opened on July 28 and serves multiple communities including Queen Anne, Magnolia, South Lake Union, Downtown, and Fremont.</p><p>The center employs a game-based curriculum structured around nine belts, mirroring martial arts ranking systems, which allows children to progress at their own pace while receiving guidance from Code Senseis and peers. This methodology maintains student motivation through incremental achievements and "Belt-Up" celebrations, with the program culminating in students publishing their own app in an app store upon completion. Additional information about the curriculum and programs can be found at <a href="https://www.codeninjas.com/wa-queen-anne" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.codeninjas.com/wa-queen-anne</a>.</p><p>Local entrepreneur Atul Goyal, who owns the franchise with his daughters Kaia and Kyra, emphasized the critical role such programs play in building foundational skills for children in the community. Goyal's background in telecom and cloud engineering at companies like T-Mobile and AWS, combined with his MBA from the University of Dallas, informs his approach to technology education and preparation for a technology-driven future.</p><p>The center began summer camps on August 1, offering various engagement opportunities including weeknight drop-in programs and Parents Night Out events on weekends. The facility aims to create a fun, safe, and social learning environment where gaming is celebrated while developing essential STEM skills that address parental desires for educational outcomes preparing children for future job markets.

The game-based learning approach represents a significant shift in how STEM education is delivered, making complex technical concepts accessible and engaging for young learners while addressing the critical need for technology literacy in future workforce development.</p>
