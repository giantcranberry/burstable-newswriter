<p>MobileX announced a significant expansion of its independent wireless dealer program at the All Wireless & Prepaid Expo, adding new master agent partnerships and introducing enhanced dealer capabilities to accelerate national growth. The expansion brings several new master agents into the MobileX ecosystem, including Orion Mobile, B2B Mobile, Modern Wireless and AH Prepaid, joining existing partners CTI Wireless, ePay, Unwired and Universal SIM to broaden the company's national footprint.</p><p>The initiative introduces several key enhancements designed to improve operational efficiency and open additional revenue streams beyond traditional plan sales. New capabilities include SIM swap functionality for easy transfer between pSIM and eSIM, quick phone number changes for customers, access to a dedicated bilingual dealer care line, and mobile activations through the <a href="https://mobilexarmy.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">MobileX Army app</a> that allows dealers to sign up customers anywhere without immediate access to a service provider portal.</p><p>Michael Lanzon, Chief Marketing and Sales Officer at MobileX, emphasized the strategic importance of the dealer network, stating that in a landscape increasingly defined by MVNO consolidation and evolving compensation models, these new tools position MobileX as a partner that helps retailers diversify and protect revenue streams. The company is also introducing flexible plan customization options, including international service and high-speed data top-ups that provide instant data boosts when customers run out mid-cycle, creating new revenue opportunities while keeping service uninterrupted.</p><p>Jason Biado, SVP of Distribution at MobileX, added that the company is building MobileX to be the most dealer-friendly carrier in the market by offering flexibility, profitability and smart tools that allow partners to deliver better service with less friction. Dealers in the MobileX network offer customers exclusive unlimited plans and assist with service onboarding, maintenance, troubleshooting, and payments, with all dealer plans including best-in-class hotspot and inclusive of all taxes and government surcharges.</p><p>The expansion comes at a critical time for independent wireless dealers facing unprecedented pressures from industry consolidation. By providing enhanced tools and support through its growing master agent network, MobileX aims to strengthen the wireless retail channel while enabling dealers to offer their communities more personalized service options.</p>
