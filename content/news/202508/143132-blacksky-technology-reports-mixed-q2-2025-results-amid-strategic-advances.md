<p>BlackSky Technology, Inc. (NYSE: BKSY) has disclosed its second-quarter financial outcomes for 2025, presenting a mixed bag of results that highlight both challenges and strategic advancements. The company reported revenues of $22.2M, adjusted EBITDA of ($2.8)M, and EPS of ($1.27), aligning with revenue expectations but marking a decline from the previous year's adjusted EBITDA profit of $2.1M. This downturn is largely due to reduced professional services revenue and continued investments in its Gen-3 and AROS projects.</p><p>Despite these challenges, BlackSky has made significant strides in its core offerings. Imagery and Software Analytical Services revenue grew by 2.9% year-over-year to $18.0M, fueled by increasing demand and early access activities related to Gen-3 imagery. However, Professional and Engineering Services revenue saw a decrease to $4.2M from $7.5M in the second quarter of 2024, attributed to timing differences in milestone-based contract recognition. The company's consolidated gross margins experienced a slight reduction to 71.9% from 72.4% in the prior year.</p><p>Strategic contract acquisitions have played a pivotal role in bolstering BlackSky's market position, with over $35.0M in new contracts secured in the second quarter of 2025. This has expanded the company's total backlog to $356.0M, with approximately 85% originating from international clients, underscoring BlackSky's global footprint. Notable achievements include a $24.0M award from the NGA Luno A monitoring program and expansion into Latin America with a Gen-2/Gen-3 On-Demand contract. Furthermore, BlackSky has advanced its Gen-3 architecture through a follow-on U.S. Navy research award focusing on optical inter-satellite link (OISL) technology.</p><p>The launch and commissioning of its second Gen-3 satellite represent a critical milestone for BlackSky, with the satellite achieving very-high resolution (35cm-class) imagery within 12 hours of launch. The company is progressing towards deploying six Gen-3 satellites in 2025 and eight by early 2026, with commercial availability anticipated in the fourth quarter of 2025. This development is supported by a strengthened balance sheet, following a $185.0M upsized convertible note offering, enabling continued investment in its satellite constellation.</p><p>BlackSky has reaffirmed its fiscal year 2025 revenue guidance of $105Mâ€“$130M and adjusted EBITDA of breakeven to $10M, expecting stronger revenue in the latter half of the year driven by increased Gen-3 availability and backlog conversion. These strategic and financial developments highlight BlackSky's dedication to maintaining a competitive edge in the rapidly evolving satellite imagery and intelligence industry.</p>
