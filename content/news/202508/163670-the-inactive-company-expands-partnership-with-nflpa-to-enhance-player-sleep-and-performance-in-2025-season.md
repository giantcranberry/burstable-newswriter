<p>The Inactive Company has announced a significant expansion of its partnership with the NFL Players Association (NFLPA), providing Inactivators Performance Sleep Masks to nine NFL teams traveling overseas for games during the 2025 season. Each team will receive 75 masks, designed to offer players a drug-free method to enhance sleep quality, performance, and recovery amidst the challenges of international travel. This initiative, now in its second year, highlights the increasing emphasis on sleep as a critical component of athletic success.</p><p>Since March 2022, The Inactive Company has collaborated with the NFLPA, integrating its sleep masks into various programs aimed at improving player health and wellness. The Inactivators, featuring patented Tru-dark technology for complete light blockage and an ergonomic design for comfort, are specifically tailored for elite athletes. With team approval, these masks can be customized with team logos, reinforcing their status as essential performance gear.</p><p>Lori Oliver, co-founder of The Inactive Company, emphasized the critical role of sleep in athletic performance, noting its significant impact on reaction times, injury prevention, and recovery. The difficulties of maintaining optimal sleep, particularly with late-night device use and demanding schedules, make tools like Inactivators invaluable for players. This is supported by scientific research, including a 2023 publication in <a href="https://www.sportsmedicine.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Sports Medicine</a>, which highlights the benefits of sleep interventions for athletic performance and recovery.</p><p>International games present unique challenges, such as disrupted circadian rhythms and the physiological stress of long flights. The Inactivators' design addresses these issues by promoting melatonin production and uninterrupted REM sleep, essential for memory consolidation and physical recovery. Jill MacRae, another co-founder, pointed out the necessity of external reinforcement to emphasize the importance of sleep to players, a goal further supported by customizing the masks with team insignias.</p><p>This partnership between The Inactive Company and the NFLPA reflects a shared commitment to utilizing science-based tools to ensure player safety and maintain competitive integrity. The nine teams benefiting from this initiative in the 2025 season, including the Pittsburgh Steelers and Minnesota Vikings, demonstrate the league's dedication to player wellness on a global scale.</p>
