<p>Crescentia Capital, the equity buyout division of Calvert Street Investment Partners, has completed a strategic growth investment in C&D Industrial Maintenance, a Bradenton, Florida-based provider of commercial door and loading dock services operating across eight Southeastern states. The investment is positioned to drive organic expansion initiatives and support strategic acquisitions as C&D develops into the region's premier door and dock services platform.</p><p>Founded in 2018, C&D serves customers throughout Florida, Georgia, Tennessee, Alabama, Mississippi, Arkansas, North Carolina and South Carolina, providing essential maintenance services for commercial facilities. The partnership with Crescentia Capital represents a significant milestone for the growing company, enabling accelerated market penetration and service expansion across its operational footprint.</p><p>Crescentia Capital's investment strategy focuses on building market-leading platforms through strategic capital deployment. The firm's current portfolio includes nine companies, among them All Clear, D2K and Terra Nova. Michael Booth, partner and chief investment officer, and Brian Guerin, managing partner, lead Crescentia's investment activities, bringing extensive experience from their backgrounds at Ernst & Young and Arthur Andersen in middle market transactions.</p><p>The transaction underscores Calvert Street Investment Partners' continued commitment to the middle market segment. The firm operates two distinct units: Crescentia Capital for equity buyouts and <a href="https://parkwaycapital.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Parkway Capital</a> for mezzanine debt and minority equity investments. Parkway typically invests $3 million to $12 million per transaction in companies generating approximately $10 million in annual revenue and $2 million of EBITDA.</p><p>Since inception, Calvert Street has deployed over $1.1 billion across more than 145 middle-market companies, with approximately $615 million in equity buyout investments through Crescentia and about $525 million in mezzanine and minority equity investments through Parkway. This substantial capital base supports the firm's strategy of identifying and growing promising businesses across multiple sectors including manufacturing, distribution, consumer products, business services, industrial services and healthcare.</p><p>The investment in C&D Industrial Maintenance represents another strategic move in Crescentia Capital's focused approach to building regional leaders in essential service industries, supporting infrastructure maintenance and operational efficiency for commercial facilities throughout the Southeast. This transaction highlights the growing importance of specialized industrial maintenance services in supporting commercial infrastructure and operational continuity across the region.</p>
