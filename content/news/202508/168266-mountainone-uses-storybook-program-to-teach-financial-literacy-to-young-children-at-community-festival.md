<p>MountainOne's Storybook Team recently engaged young audiences at the Scituate Heritage Days summer festival with a reading of "Something to Save," the second book in their original financial education series. The event, coordinated by Brenda Petell, MountainOne's vice president and community engagement officer, featured the beloved character Mo the Spokesgoat and his friend Penny the Chipmunk teaching children about saving money, planning ahead, and making thoughtful financial choices.</p><p>The interactive reading session encouraged children to share what they enjoy saving for, sparking meaningful conversations about financial goal-setting. Petell noted the visible delight on children's faces, particularly when Mo made his appearance, creating memorable photo opportunities while reinforcing financial lessons. "It is so gratifying to know that through our storybook series, we're helping to financially educate the next generation," Petell stated.</p><p>The storybook program represents MountainOne's commitment to building early financial awareness through accessible, engaging methods. The growing series, which includes "How to Climb a Mountain" and "Something to Save," promotes both literacy and financial education while teaching positive life skills. The program regularly visits schools, libraries, and community organizations, combining interactive readings with opportunities for children to meet Mo in person.</p><p>This initiative addresses the critical need for early financial education, as research shows that money habits are often formed by age seven. By making financial concepts approachable through storytelling and character engagement, MountainOne helps children develop foundational money management skills that can benefit them throughout their lives. Families interested in the program can access free resources and learn about upcoming events through <a href="https://mountainone.com/mo-storybook" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">mountainone.com/mo-storybook</a>.</p><p>The Scituate event demonstrates how financial institutions can play a vital role in community education beyond traditional banking services. By integrating financial literacy into community festivals and educational settings, MountainOne creates opportunities for children to learn money management skills in environments where they feel comfortable and engaged, potentially shaping healthier financial behaviors for future generations.</p>
