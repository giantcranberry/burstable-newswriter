<p>Lafayette Square has completed a $65 million private placement of senior notes to qualified institutional investors, providing the private credit firm with significant long-term financing. The senior notes carry a 7.00% fixed interest rate and mature on August 19, 2030, offering stable returns to investors while securing capital for the company's expansion initiatives.</p><p>The financing follows Morningstar DBRS awarding Lafayette Square USA, Inc. a Long-Term Issuer Rating and Long-Term Senior Debt credit rating of BBB (low) with a Stable Trend. The rating agency's assessment, detailed in their <a href="https://dbrs.morningstar.com/research/457729/morningstar-dbrs-assigns-lafayette-square-usa-inc-long-term-credit-ratings-of-bbb-low-with-a-stable-trend" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">full rating report</a>, cited the firm's strong operating performance, improved profitability, dividend coverage, and consistent credit performance with a conservative leverage profile. This investment-grade rating enhances the company's credibility in capital markets and potentially lowers future borrowing costs.</p><p>Goldman Sachs served as lead placement agent for the transaction, with Raymond James and Keefe, Bruyette & Woods acting as co-placement agents, demonstrating institutional confidence in Lafayette Square's business model. Damien Dwin, Founder and CEO, stated that the successful private placement reflects institutional investor interest in working-class people and places, highlighting the growing appeal of socially conscious investing strategies within the private credit sector.</p><p>The transaction provides diversification benefits to shareholders alongside the company's existing low-cost liabilities from the U.S. Small Business Administration. The firm recently reported second quarter earnings through its regulatory filings, including detailed financial and performance information available on its <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/123456789/000123456789000000/form10-q.htm" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Form 10-Q</a> and <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/123456789/000123456789000000/form8-k.htm" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Form 8-K</a> filings for the quarter ended June 30, 2025.</p><p>Lafayette Square's investment strategy focuses on lending to growing middle market companies in working-class communities, employing a technology-driven approach through its Potomac X Lafayette Square platform. The firm emphasizes non-sponsored deals and provides enhanced managerial assistance through its Worker Solutions platform. This $65 million capital infusion strengthens the company's ability to execute its thesis that working-class markets represent attractive investment opportunities when combined with conservative underwriting and technological enhancement, potentially setting a precedent for other private credit firms seeking to address underserved market segments.</p>
