<p>South Florida-based ArcticCollagen will present its innovative collagen formulation at the ECRM Vitamin, Weight Management & Sports Nutrition Session in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida, from September 7-10. The company's product features 8,000 mg of pure hydrolyzed marine collagen, 8 grams of lean protein, hyaluronic acid, and Vitamin C in a sweet-tasting format designed for consumer convenience.</p><p>ArcticCollagen President Jasmien Winqvist expressed excitement about showcasing the company's modernized collagen formula on a larger platform. The ECRM event specializes in connecting manufacturers with retail buyers through private meetings, potentially leading to partnerships with major retailers like GNC, Vitamin Shoppe, and Vitamin World.</p><p>The collagen supplement is made from sustainably sourced skin of wild-caught Northern European white fish, cod, and salmon, hydrolyzed in Norway. Available in strawberry and lemon varieties, the honey-like substance can be easily added to breakfast foods or taken on the go. According to information from <a href="https://www.healthline.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Healthline</a>, collagen is the most abundant protein in the body, serving as the main component of connective tissue in tendons, ligaments, skin, and muscles.</p><p>Collagen supplements like ArcticCollagen target multiple health concerns, particularly as natural collagen levels decline with age. The product aims to slow skin aging, relieve joint pain, reduce inflammation, improve muscle mass, and support heart, gut, and brain health. The company has experienced significant growth this year, with national launches including availability on <a href="https://www.amazon.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Amazon.com</a> and an upcoming debut on <a href="https://www.walmart.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Walmart.com</a>.</p><p>ArcticCollagen is currently available for purchase on <a href="https://www.onelavi.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">OneLavi.com</a>, Medpaid Market, and Amazon.com, with a 14-sachet package retailing for $47.99. The company's participation in the ECRM conference represents a strategic move to expand its market presence and establish new industry relationships following what Winqvist described as a record-breaking year for the team.</p><p>This development signals the continued growth of the collagen supplement market, which caters to health-conscious consumers seeking convenient solutions for age-related wellness concerns. The industry impact includes potential expansion into major retail channels and increased competition in the nutritional supplement space, particularly for marine-sourced products that emphasize sustainability and scientific formulation.</p>
