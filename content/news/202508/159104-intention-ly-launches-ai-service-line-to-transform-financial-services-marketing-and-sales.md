<p>Intention.ly has unveiled a new AI service line specifically tailored for financial services companies, offering a range of vetted, high-impact marketing and sales tools. This launch is timely, as the financial sector stands at a crossroads: adopt AI to maintain competitiveness or risk obsolescence as competitors harness these technologies for greater efficiency and customer engagement.</p><p>Kelly Waltrich, CEO of Intention.ly, underscored the critical nature of timely AI adoption, remarking on the fleeting opportunity for firms to leverage AI for market leadership. Intention.ly has undertaken the rigorous task of evaluating numerous AI platforms to curate the most effective solutions, thereby enabling firms to bypass the resource-intensive process of in-house development.</p><p>Zohray Brennan, Director of Marketing Automation and Operations at Intention.ly, pointed out the company's proficiency in integrating diverse tech and AI platforms into cohesive systems. This integration not only amplifies the effectiveness of each tool but also ensures cost efficiency, a feat that demands both technical acumen and industry insight.</p><p>Building on the triumph of its Advisor Brand Builder platform in 2023, Intention.ly is broadening its AI service offerings. The new suite includes Custom GPT Assistants for creating secure, branded AI tools, AI Readiness Audits to evaluate firms' AI integration preparedness, and AI SEO Audits & Monitoring to optimize visibility in generative search environments. The Go-to-Market Engineering Toolkit and Intention.Lead service are also part of the expansion, designed to convert growth strategies into tangible, scalable outcomes.</p><p>Moreover, Intention.ly has forged agency partnerships with select AI solutions, granting clients privileged access to top-tier tools at favorable rates. These collaborations ensure a smooth onboarding process, customization, and continuous support, effectively mitigating the typical challenges associated with standalone AI tool implementation, such as integration complexities, compliance issues, and operational obstacles.</p><p>For those keen on exploring Intention.ly's AI services further, an upcoming fireside chat featuring Kelly Waltrich and Tina Powell is scheduled for Thursday, August 28 at 2 PM ET.
