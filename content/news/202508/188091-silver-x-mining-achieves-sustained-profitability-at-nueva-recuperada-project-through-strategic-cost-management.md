<p>Silver X Mining Corp. achieved sustained pre-tax profitability through the second quarter of 2025 at its Nueva Recuperada Project in central Peru, marking a significant turnaround from losses in the previous year. The company generated a pre-tax income of $166,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2025, compared to a loss of $539,000 during the same period in 2024, representing a 131% improvement.</p><p>CEO Jose Garcia emphasized that achieving profitability at this stage provides a solid foundation for accelerated growth, stating that disciplined execution is becoming increasingly evident as the company enters a pivotal phase. While operational metrics showed declines, with processed tonnage dropping 9% year-to-date and silver equivalent head grades falling 12%, financial performance improved substantially due to cost management and reduced depreciation expenses.</p><p>The company completed 1,788 meters of mine development in the first quarter, expanding operations and accessing higher-grade target areas, while 2,253 exploration meters were drilled in the second quarter as part of an 8,000-meter plan for 2025. Operating income increased nearly 200% in the first half of 2025 compared to 2024, reaching $847,000 in the second quarter alone, a 55% increase from the same quarter last year.</p><p>Despite a 14% decrease in net operating revenues from concentrate sales, primarily due to a 24% decrease in silver equivalent metal sold, cost reductions drove profitability improvements. Cost of sales decreased by $1.2 million in the second quarter, attributed to an 83% reduction in depreciation expense resulting from increased measured and indicated mineral resources. The company's all-in sustaining cost per silver equivalent ounce produced increased to $28.50 for the six-month period, up 33.4% from 2024, reflecting investments in sustainable capital expenditures that enable access to new production fronts.</p><p>Net losses decreased by 71% to $410,000 for the six-month period, while quarter-on-quarter net losses were reduced by 52% to $79,000 in the second quarter of 2025. EBITDA remained positive at $908,000 for the first half, though down from $2.2 million in the same period of 2024. The company maintains that these non-IFRS measures provide investors with improved ability to evaluate underlying performance, with detailed reconciliations available in its Management's Discussion and Analysis filed on <a href="https://www.sedarplus.ca" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">SEDAR+</a>.</p><p>Silver X's performance demonstrates the potential of Peru's silver and gold districts despite operational challenges, with the company positioning itself for transformative growth through strategic development and disciplined financial management. The results indicate that modest capital infusion could unlock additional value in what management describes as one of Peru's most prolific yet underdeveloped mining districts.</p>
