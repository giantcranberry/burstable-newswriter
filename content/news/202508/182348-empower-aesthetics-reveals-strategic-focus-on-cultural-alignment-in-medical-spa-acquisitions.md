<p>Empower Aesthetics has detailed its strategic approach to medical spa acquisitions, emphasizing cultural fit and founder partnerships as critical components for long-term success. According to Matt Botha, Senior Director of M&A at Empower Aesthetics, the company prioritizes partnering with founders who have built exceptional businesses and demonstrate commitment to continued growth. This focus on cultural alignment has evolved since the platform's inception in 2023, with increasing emphasis on leadership depth alongside financial performance and clinical reputation.</p><p>The company leverages its scale across 21+ locations to centralize back-office functions including purchasing, payroll, HR, digital marketing, and recruitment. This centralized support system allows founders to focus on patient care and team leadership while benefiting from shared resources. Empower also facilitates knowledge sharing through case studies, advanced training programs, and standardized operating procedures that ensure consistent customer communication and operational efficiency across all locations.</p><p>Maintaining local brand identity remains a cornerstone of Empower's integration strategy. The company does not change acquired practices' brand names and respects each partner's clinical philosophy and standards. A thorough clinical due diligence process led by board member Dr. Leslie Baumann ensures compliance while preserving individual practice identities. The Clinical Advisory Board, composed of partner founders, guides platform-wide decisions and discusses legislative changes, ensuring founder involvement in major decisions.</p><p>Integration processes are designed to balance preservation of unique practice identities with alignment to shared goals and systems. The structured approach includes transitioning financial systems, implementing payroll solutions, and ensuring smooth operational workflows. Founder involvement post-acquisition is essential for successful cultural integration, particularly important given that many partners are founder-led, often by women. This demographic reality shapes Empower's M&A approach, prioritizing trust, transparency, and co-creation of long-term visions that respect both legacy and growth.</p><p>Cultural assessment during due diligence utilizes tools like the PI Index to evaluate personality types, strengths, and team dynamics. This approach helps foster productive working relationships and enables tailored support after closing. The structured HR due diligence process includes talent assessment using the 9-box grid, providing deeper insight into leadership strength and development opportunities within each organization. This comprehensive approach to cultural evaluation ensures that Empower maintains the unique culture of each business while integrating them into the larger platform successfully.</p>
