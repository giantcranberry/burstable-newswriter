<p>DYWIDAG has established a new production facility in Pottstown, Pennsylvania, strategically positioning itself to address growing infrastructure demands across the Northeast region. The facility, located in the former Bethlehem Steel complex, represents a significant milestone in the company's U.S. expansion strategy while contributing to local economic revitalization.</p><p>The Pennsylvania location places DYWIDAG near major infrastructure hubs including Philadelphia and New York City, enabling improved delivery times and enhanced production capabilities. According to Mike Kelley, President for the Americas Region at DYWIDAG, the Northeast is a burgeoning area for infrastructure development and increasing demand for advanced geotechnical and structural solutions. The facility builds on the area's industrial legacy while supporting the company's mission to make infrastructure safer, stronger, and smarter.</p><p>Central to the facility's operations is the production of DYWIDAG's THREADBAR system, the only ASTM A722-compliant reinforcement system available in the U.S. market. This high-performance solution is used in geotechnical and post-tensioning applications worldwide, offering advantages including faster construction times, higher quality, and lower project costs. The THREADBAR system reduces steel congestion in structural applications compared to traditional reinforcement, resulting in easier concrete placement and potential for more efficient structural designs.</p><p>DYWIDAG has assembled an experienced team to lead this expansion, including Maureen Merson, a Geotechnical Engineer with deep project lifecycle knowledge who serves as President of the Mohawk-Hudson Section of the <a href="https://www.asce.org" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">American Society of Civil Engineers</a>. The team also includes Rey Clavel, bringing over two decades of field, engineering, and quality control-certified construction management expertise, and Steve Scott, Northeast Sales Manager with 14 years of technical sales experience in product specification and field exploration.</p><p>Founded in Germany in 1865, DYWIDAG maintains operations in over 50 countries with more than 1,600 professionals. The company's innovation focus continues through advanced reinforcement systems, data-driven monitoring, and corrosion protection technologies. The Pennsylvania investment reinforces DYWIDAG's commitment to localized support and expertise while supporting major infrastructure projects across the Northeast region with faster response times and reliable supply chain capabilities.</p>
