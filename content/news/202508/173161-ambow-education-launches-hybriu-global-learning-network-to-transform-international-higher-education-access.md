<p>Ambow Education has introduced the HybriU Global Learning Network, a comprehensive solution designed to help U.S. universities expand their international student enrollment without the traditional barriers of relocation. The system addresses mobility challenges, rising tuition costs, and bureaucratic hurdles that have increasingly disrupted international education pathways.</p><p>The network consists of two integrated components: the HybriU University Alliance and a network of HybriU Global Learning Centers. Through the alliance, students can enroll in U.S. degree programs and begin earning credits immediately while remaining in their home countries. Courses are delivered via HybriU, Ambow's AI-powered platform that merges physical and digital learning into a unified experience featuring multilingual AI translation, smart whiteboards, immersive 3D classrooms, and adaptive learning tools.</p><p>The physical component includes HybriU Global Learning Centers, which are tech-enabled hubs located in key international cities. These centers provide local academic support, hybrid learning services, and enrollment assistance, functioning as micro-campuses that are locally tailored but fully integrated into U.S. universities' academic ecosystems. Additional information about the platform is available at <a href="https://www.HybriU.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.HybriU.com</a>.</p><p>Ambow is currently finalizing partnerships to launch HybriU Learning Centers in Singapore and China, with plans for expansion into additional regions. The network's scalability allows universities to onboard through simple licensing or revenue-sharing agreements while Ambow and its regional partners manage setup and daily operations. This plug-and-play model enables global expansion without the substantial costs and complexities associated with building new physical campuses abroad.</p><p>The system creates a frictionless educational pathway where international students gain access to world-class U.S. education while universities maintain the quality, engagement, and academic rigor of their on-campus programs. Built for scale and supported by local teams and shared infrastructure, the HybriU Global Learning Network represents a significant shift in how international education can be delivered and accessed globally.</p>
