<p>L3Harris Technologies has completed a $100 million expansion at its satellite integration and test facility in Palm Bay, Florida, to support the Department of Defense's urgent need for on-orbit technology for America's Golden Dome missile defense initiative. The 94,000-square-foot facility expansion will enable production of next-generation satellites designed to identify, track and defend against hypersonic and advanced missile threats.</p><p>Christopher E. Kubasik, Chair and CEO of L3Harris, stated that accelerating production of proven hardware for national missile warning and defense remains a priority as the company aligns resources to support the President's vision for America's Golden Dome. The company continues to deliver advanced space-based technology with the speed and agility required to protect the homeland from advanced threats while bolstering U.S. manufacturing capabilities.</p><p>L3Harris currently provides crucial missile warning and missile defense capabilities with five satellites already on orbit and 34 additional satellites being developed specifically for hypersonic missile tracking. These systems support the DOD's current missile warning and missile defense architecture, representing a significant advancement in national security technology.</p><p>U.S. Representative Mike Haridopolos acknowledged L3Harris as an instrumental leader in both space and national defense, emphasizing the company's vital role in the Golden Dome initiative. The expansion represents part of L3Harris' broader investment strategy, with hundreds of millions of dollars allocated to infrastructure and manufacturing processes across the United States to deliver national defense capabilities at the required pace and scale.</p><p>Palm Bay Mayor Rob Medina highlighted the facility's role in strengthening national security and sustaining America's technological edge. The investment not only supports critical defense and space missions but also drives local economic opportunity through the creation of high-skill, high-wage jobs in the region. L3Harris' nationwide investments translate to more than 900,000 square feet of new and renovated advanced manufacturing space supporting production of space-based missile warning and defense technologies, precision fire-control sensing, targets, and propulsion and control systems for interceptors.</p>
