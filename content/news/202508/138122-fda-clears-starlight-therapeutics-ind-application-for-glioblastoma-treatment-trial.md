<p>Starlight Therapeutics, a subsidiary of Lantern Pharma (NASDAQ: LTRN), has received FDA clearance for its Investigational New Drug (IND) application, enabling a Phase Ib/2a clinical trial for STAR-001 (LP-184) in combination with spironolactone to treat glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) at first progression. GBM, a highly aggressive brain cancer with few treatment options, makes this development a significant advancement in oncology.</p><p>The trial will evaluate the safety, tolerability, and preliminary efficacy of the combination therapy in recurrent GBM patients. STAR-001, a brain-penetrant DNA-damaging agent, targets DNA repair deficiencies through synthetic lethality, a mechanism enhanced by spironolactone's induction of NER deficiency in tumor cells. This approach has earned Orphan Drug and Fast Track designations from the FDA, highlighting its potential to meet a critical unmet need.</p><p>Leveraging data from an ongoing Phase 1a trial, the program utilizes Lantern Pharma's AI-driven RADR(R) platform to pinpoint optimal patient populations and streamline development. The integration of artificial intelligence in drug development is a forward-thinking strategy aimed at reducing costs, time, and failure rates in oncology research.

The STAR-001 and spironolactone combination could emerge as a novel therapeutic avenue for recurrent GBM patients, a group desperately in need of effective treatments. The trial's results are eagerly anticipated by the medical and scientific communities, as they may signal a breakthrough in brain cancer therapy.</p>
