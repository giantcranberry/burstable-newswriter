<p>inDrive, a global mobility platform operating in 48 countries, has launched its financial service inDrive.Money in Brazil, offering drivers quick access to cash loans directly through the ride-hailing application. The service aims to enhance financial inclusion by providing convenient financing options to drivers who often face challenges accessing traditional banking services.</p><p>The platform partners with <a href="https://emprex.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">EmpreX</a>, a Latin American fintech specializing in small business financing, to manage the entire loan process from assessment to disbursement. Drivers can apply for loans and make repayments directly within the inDrive app, streamlining what would typically be a complex financial transaction into a few simple taps.</p><p>Alexander Kurchin, Head of Growth at inDrive.Money, stated that Brazil represents one of the company's most critical markets, with hundreds of thousands of drivers relying on the platform for income. The expansion builds on successful implementations in Mexico, Colombia, and Peru, offering a proven financial tool that supports drivers' economic independence and daily livelihoods.</p><p>Initial results indicate strong driver engagement and satisfaction with the service, with 86% of users reporting they would take another loan if needed and would recommend the product to others. The service is currently available in approximately 90 Brazilian cities, including major urban centers like Manaus, Fortaleza, Salvador, Belo Horizonte, and Florianópolis, as well as mid-sized cities such as Campinas and Marabá.</p><p>Silvan Roth, CEO of EmpreX, emphasized the transformative impact of integrating credit services directly into the inDrive app, noting that many service providers previously resorted to loans with unfavorable terms. The partnership provides drivers with immediate working capital, enabling them to maintain their vehicles and continue working without financial interruptions.</p><p>The financial assessment and regulatory compliance are managed through EmpreX's partnership with <a href="https://bmpscd.com.br" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">BMP SCD</a>, a licensed Brazilian financial institution that handles scoring, repayment terms, and loan disbursement. This integration represents part of inDrive's broader strategy to diversify beyond ride-hailing services and work toward its mission of improving the lives of 1 billion people by 2030 through fair services and expanded financial inclusion.</p>
