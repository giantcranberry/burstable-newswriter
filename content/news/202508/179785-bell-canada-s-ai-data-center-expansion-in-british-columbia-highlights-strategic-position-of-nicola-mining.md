<p>Telecom giant Bell Canada's announcement to construct six new AI data centers in British Columbia, forming a data center supercluster, has significant implications for regional resource development and industrial demand. The strategic positioning of Nicola Mining Inc. (TSX.V: NIM) (OTCQB: HUSIF) becomes particularly relevant as the first center will be located in Kamloops, with the second slated for Merritt by year-end, confirming the importance of the region where Nicola Mining operates.</p><p>Nicola Mining is committed to meeting the surge in copper industrial demand while continuing to develop its asset at the New Craigmont property. This property shares a regional geological setting with the Highland Valley Copper District, Canada's largest copper producer. The company's New Craigmont Copper project is making significant strides, with recent exploration updates including the drilling of 14 holes totaling 4,872 meters. Early findings have revealed chalcopyrite (copper sulphide) mineralization, focusing on newly identified zones and areas adjacent to historic targets.</p><p>The drilling across the MARB and CAS zones demonstrates consistent mineral presence in volcanic and intrusive host rocks. For further information, visit <a href="https://www.NicolaMining.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.NicolaMining.com</a>. Additionally, the latest news and updates relating to HUSIF are available in the company's newsroom at <a href="https://ibn.fm/HUSIF" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://ibn.fm/HUSIF</a>.</p><p>Nicola Mining maintains a 100%-owned mill and tailings facility near Merritt, British Columbia, and has signed Mining and Milling Profit Share Agreements with high-grade gold projects. The fully permitted mill can process both gold and silver mill feed via gravity and flotation processes, making it the only permitted third-party processing facility in British Columbia. The company also owns 100% of the Treasure Mountain Silver Project nearby.</p><p>The convergence of increased copper demand driven by AI data center expansion and Nicola Mining's exploration progress positions the company to potentially benefit from regional economic growth and resource needs. This development underscores the importance of domestic resource production in supporting technological infrastructure and industrial demands, particularly as AI and data center technologies continue to drive copper consumption across multiple industries.</p>
