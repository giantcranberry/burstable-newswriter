<p>PediaMetrix, Inc., developer of the FDA-cleared SoftSpot mobile app for pediatric skull-shape screening, has been awarded a $2 million grant through the <a href="https://www.nih.gov" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">National Institutes of Health</a> Commercialization Readiness Program. The funding will accelerate the commercialization of the SoftSpot Total Care Solution and support expansion into new pediatric diagnostic tools using artificial intelligence.</p><p>The NIH CRP grant serves a later-stage mission designed to bridge the gap between development and full-scale commercialization for promising biomedical technologies. This funding will enable PediaMetrix to prepare SoftSpot and associated AI tools for broader clinical and commercial adoption, representing a significant step toward making advanced pediatric screening more accessible to healthcare providers and families.</p><p>The grant will support the advancement of SoftSpot's 2D and 3D imaging capabilities along with the development of next-generation AI tools for early detection of pediatric ear and dental deformities. SoftSpot pioneers early detection of cranial shape abnormalities at the point of care, having empowered pediatricians and parents to scan infants' heads quickly and efficiently as the first FDA-cleared mobile app of its kind.</p><p>With this CRP award, the newly expanded SoftSpot Total Care Solution will include both refined 2D and enhanced 3D scanning, delivering richer diagnostic insights. The company is extending its reach beyond cranial analysis by developing complementary AI solutions such as EarSpot for early ear deformity screening and upcoming tools for detecting dental and other pediatric abnormalities.</p><p>The funding represents a critical investment in pediatric healthcare technology that addresses the need for early detection and reduced care costs through AI and computer vision-based solutions. This development has significant implications for improving pediatric screening accessibility and advancing the use of mobile technology in clinical settings, potentially transforming how pediatric abnormalities are detected and managed globally.</p>
