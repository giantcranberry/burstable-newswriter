<p>Gelt Venture Partners, LLC (GVP) has expanded its portfolio in the San Diego area with the acquisition of The Commodore, a 92-unit multifamily property in National City, California, for $40 million. This transaction highlights the enduring appeal of high-quality rental housing in south San Diego County, where The Commodore is the sole Class A market-rate community within a five-mile radius. The property's rapid stabilization to a 96% occupancy rate within ten months of leasing commencement speaks volumes about the local demand for upscale living spaces.</p><p>Strategically located at 200 to 250 E. 31st Street, The Commodore offers residents unparalleled access to downtown San Diego, Chula Vista, and a plethora of employment, retail, and coastal amenities. Keith Wasserman, a Partner at GVP, pointed out the property's unique position in a market with scant competition from other market-rate multifamily developments, a key factor in the firm's decision to invest.</p><p>The San Diego multifamily market's resilience is evident in National City's performance, boasting a 97% average apartment occupancy and a 6.8% annual rent growth since 2020. Josh Satin, GVP Partner and Chief Investment Officer, emphasized The Commodore's prospects for continued high occupancy and rent growth, buoyed by its affluent demographic, limited new supply, and prime location. This acquisition follows GVP's purchase of Rancho Hills Apartments in Vista for $53.5 million in July 2024, further cementing the firm's commitment to the San Diego market.</p><p>GVP intends to apply its operational expertise to enhance The Commodore's value through improved management efficiencies, while capitalizing on the property's strategic location for long-term appreciation. The firm's focus on the western U.S. multifamily market aligns with its strategy to invest in regions with strong fundamentals and growth potential. The transaction was facilitated by Hunter Combs of Walker Dunlap, who represented both parties involved in the deal.</p><p>For more information on Gelt Venture Partners and their investments, visit <a href='https://www.geltvp.com' rel='nofollow' target='_blank'>https://www.geltvp.com</a>.
