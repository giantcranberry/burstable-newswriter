<p>ANITA & ZAHA, a French beauty brand established in 2024, is making waves in the luxury skincare sector by prioritizing natural ingredients and ethical production practices. The brand's rapid expansion across Europe and North America highlights a growing consumer demand for products that are not only effective but also environmentally and socially responsible.</p><p>The brand's commitment to sustainability is evident in its use of premium natural ingredients, such as organic goat's milk and donkey's milk from the Pays de la Loire region, alongside plant-based and marine actives. ANITA & ZAHA adheres to a strict no animal fat policy and minimizes palm oil usage, employing it only when essential and in traceable quantities. This approach ensures that each product offers both efficacy and a luxurious sensory experience, without compromising on ethical standards.</p><p>ANITA & ZAHA's ethical vision is built on three core pillars: protecting the planet through eco-design and zero-waste production, promoting education, and celebrating cultural diversity. A notable example of its environmental commitment is the donation of 1.5% of its annual revenue to <a href="https://stripe.com/climate" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Stripe Climate</a> to support carbon removal technologies, further solidifying its position as a leader in sustainable beauty.</p><p>The brand's product lineup includes innovative offerings such as a shaving soap with organic donkey's milk and Argan oil, a solid shampoo bar, an exfoliating solid cleanser, and a 3-in-1 floral cleanser. Each product is designed for durability, aligning with the brand's zero-waste philosophy and appealing to eco-conscious consumers.</p><p>With its trademark registered in the European Union, Switzerland, United Kingdom, and Monaco, and pending in Liechtenstein, ANITA & ZAHA has achieved international recognition. Its products are available worldwide through its official store, <a href="https://www.amazon.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Amazon</a>, and selected international platforms, as well as exclusive B2B partnerships across Europe and North America. The brand's success, underscored by over 150,000 engaged followers on social media, reflects a shifting paradigm in the beauty industry towards sustainability and ethical responsibility.</p>
