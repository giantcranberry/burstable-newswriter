<p>The Greater Baltimore Chamber of Commerce has announced a strategic expansion to serve the entire Baltimore County business community, positioning itself as a unifying force and advocate for local businesses and regional economic development. This expansion builds on the organization's foundation of supporting business leaders, entrepreneurs, and organizations across northwest Baltimore County since its founding in 1977.</p><p>Under the leadership of Dr. Beth Rheingold, President & CEO, the chamber is extending its reach and services throughout the full geographic footprint of Baltimore County. Dr. Rheingold stated, "Due to our commitment to inclusion, economic opportunity, and achieving results for businesses of all sizes and sectors across Baltimore County, we are well-positioned to amplify a unified voice for businesses."</p><p>The expansion comes at a time of transition within the region's evolving chamber landscape, with businesses throughout the county being invited to join a dynamic, forward-thinking chamber that prioritizes relationships, results, and legislative advocacy. As part of this expansion, GBCC is strengthening its services, staff capabilities, and engagement tools for new and existing members.</p><p>Key enhancements include a refreshed website and directory to increase visibility for local businesses scheduled for August 2025, streamlined member communications and event registration, and the launch of a new customer-facing platform promoting member businesses in Fall 2025. The chamber is also developing a swiftly growing network of county-wide business professionals, county-wide networking events, and advocacy initiatives across Baltimore County.</p><p>GBCC has been recognized with a 2025 Candid Silver Seal of Transparency, signifying an important level of organizational transparency for its members and partners. Dr. Rheingold recently completed a four-year professional development program through the <a href="https://www.uschamber.com/institute" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">U.S. Chamber of Commerce's Institute for Organizational Management</a>, earning an internationally recognized certificate held by top leaders in the chamber and association world.</p><p>The organization has recently welcomed Ariana Sakhi as Membership & Events Coordinator, who will serve as a dedicated point of contact for all member inquiries and support needs. Kimberly Fernandez, Chair of the Greater Baltimore Chamber of Commerce Board, emphasized the importance of this expansion, stating, "We believe that by connecting businesses across the entire county, we can strengthen economic opportunity, visibility, and growth."</p><p>GBCC's office remains located in Pikesville, MD, positioning the chamber within easy reach of I-695, Baltimore County government offices, and the communities that make up Baltimore County. Due to GBCC's strong commitment to commercial revitalization and the vital role chambers play in supporting Community Revitalization Districts, the organization has no plans to relocate at this time.</p>
