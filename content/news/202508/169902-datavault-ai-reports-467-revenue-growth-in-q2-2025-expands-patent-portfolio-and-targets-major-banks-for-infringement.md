<p>Datavault AI Inc. reported $1.7 million in revenue for the second quarter of 2025, representing a 467% year-over-year increase from $0.3 million in Q2 2024. The company also achieved 176% sequential quarterly growth, demonstrating accelerating momentum in intellectual property commercialization and strategic partnerships. This performance underscores the successful integration of CompuSystems, API Media, ADIO, and Datavault technologies under unified operations.</p><p>The company secured a $2.5 million patent licensing agreement with Nyiax Inc., not included in Q2 results, which provides access to the NASDAQ financial framework and supports the launch of three token exchanges. This cross-licensing agreement, paid in Nyiax stock, strengthens the partnership between the companies and enhances future revenue visibility. These achievements reflect the operational and financial momentum under new leadership since January 7, 2025.</p><p>Datavault AI's integration initiatives with IBM Watsonx, Nyiax, GFT Rewards, and Turner Global Media are driving revenue acceleration toward a $25 million run rate by year-end, positioning the company for a $40â€“$50 million revenue target in 2026. The company's expanding intellectual property portfolio now includes 72 patent assets, 14 issued trademarks, and additional pending protections, validating its growing market position.</p><p>A significant development occurred on July 21 when the company announced that top U.S. banks have been identified as patent infringers by third-party legal counsel. The infringement involves Datavault AI's patented exchange and Web 3.0 technologies designed to monetize data, real-world assets, and precious earth elements. The company has retained Fish Richardson LLP for licensing settlements or litigation activities, supported by extensive financial and technological expert reviews.</p><p>Strategic initiatives for Q3 2025 include launching new international exchanges leveraging Datavault's Web3 infrastructure, advancing commercialization of IBM-powered AI agents, completing strategic acquisitions in Acoustic and Data divisions, and executing supercomputing and AI development strategies. The company will also provide updates on API Media integration following selection by a leading event company for acquisition.</p><p>Recent highlights include the debut of enterprise commercialization for AI agents built with IBM watsonx.ai, issuance of a carbon credit tokenization patent on June 20, strategic licensing agreements with GFT Rewards for ADIO-enabled mobile rewards, and NFL Alumni Health utilizing ADIO for health-focused Web 3.0 activations. Integration activities have been completed for WiSA's wireless audio IP, CompuSystems event registration systems, and ADIO into the NYAIX Marketing Management System.</p><p>Management believes revenue growth and increased cash flows from licensed technologies, product lines, and acquired revenue streams will drive sustainable growth toward optimized break-even points. The company is targeting annual cost-efficiency measures yielding total savings exceeding $4 million by 2026 while optimizing for continued expansion. CEO Nate Bradley stated that these achievements reflect focused execution on integrating acquisitions and innovating with partners. An investor conference call is scheduled for August 20, 2025, to review business progress and discuss strategic priorities, accessible through <a href="https://ir.datavaultsite.com/news-events/ir-calendar" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://ir.datavaultsite.com/news-events/ir-calendar</a>.</p>
