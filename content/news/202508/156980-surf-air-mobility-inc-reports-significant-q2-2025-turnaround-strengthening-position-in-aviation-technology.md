EPS of ($1.34), exceeding its own projections. This achievement underscores the company's successful strategies in optimizing its On Demand segment and the increasing utilization of its SurfOS software platform, leading to profitability in airline operations on an Adj. EBITDA basis.</p><p>Strategic financial actions, including raising $44.7M in equity capital and reducing debt by equitizing $29.9M of convertible notes, have further strengthened the company's financial position. A significant development was the expansion of its partnership with <a href="https://www.palantir.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Palantir</a>, securing a five-year exclusive agreement for software configuration and sales, enhancing its footprint in the aviation technology sector.</p><p>Operational milestones included a 20% year-over-year improvement in on-time departure and arrival metrics, the highest since January 2023. The renewal of an Essential Air Service contract in Hawaii, valued at $4.2M over four years, and investments in fleet refurbishment highlight the company's dedication to improving customer experience and network reliability.</p><p>The SurfOS platform, developed on Palantir's Foundry, introduced BrokerOS, OperatorOS, and OwnerOS, aiming to streamline aviation operations. The platform's growth was marked by six new LOI agreements with charter brokers and operators, alongside new features to enhance scheduling, pricing accuracy, and maintenance processes.</p><p>Surf Air Mobility continues to lead in aviation electrification, with its electric powertrain program for the Cessna Caravan progressing towards FAA certification by 2027. The company's strategic joint ventures ensure capital efficiency while advancing its electrification objectives.</p><p>Management is optimistic about meeting its full-year revenue target of $100.0M and achieving positive Adj. EBITDA by year-end, despite potential tariff impacts. With a current valuation trading at a FY26 EV/Revenue of 1.7x compared to peers at a median of 3.3x, Surf Air Mobility presents a unique investment opportunity, with a projected valuation range of $5.50 to $8.90.</p>
