<p>Cheddar TV's investment showcase program Go Fund Yourself featured AGTools, a data intelligence platform for the agricultural sector, and Zero Energy Developments, a builder of climate-resilient homes, in its third season. Both ventures presented solutions addressing critical economic and environmental challenges to national audiences and potential investors, demonstrating where investor capital is increasingly flowing: into data-driven efficiency platforms and sustainable infrastructure solutions.</p><p>AGTools addresses the agricultural industry's digital gap by providing real-time data on more than 500 fruits, vegetables, and commodities. CEO Martha Montoya's platform aggregates government and institutional data, enabling growers, distributors, and retailers to reduce spoilage, forecast demand, and improve pricing decisions. Early adopters have reported multi-million-dollar gains, positioning AGTools as critical infrastructure for the $5 billion agricultural data market. The company will be raising capital through their platform at https://ag.tools.</p><p>Zero Energy Developments, founded by Armando and Anita Ortega, builds homes designed to operate fully off-grid through integrated solar power, battery storage, and AI-driven energy management systems. Their residences exceed both Zero Energy and Energy Star standards while offering recurring revenue potential through energy optimization services. The company represents an early entry opportunity into a sustainable housing sector poised for double-digit growth over the next decade. Interested parties can learn more about their investment opportunity through their funding portal at https://zeroenergydevelopments.com.</p><p>The series provides startups with visibility, access to seasoned investors including Rory Cutaia, Jayson Waller, and David Meltzer, and exposure to equity crowdfunding opportunities. This combination of entertainment and capital formation creates a unique pipeline for investors seeking early-stage opportunities with both market traction and cultural relevance. Both categories reflect broader macro trends including digitization of legacy industries and decarbonization of the built environment that are reshaping global markets.</p><p>The program's combination of visibility, validation, and capital access provides founders with national exposure and insights from industry leaders who understand scaling demands. For business and technology leaders, these developments signal important investment trends toward solutions that combine technological innovation with environmental sustainability, representing opportunities in sectors undergoing significant transformation.</p>
