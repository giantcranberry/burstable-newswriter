<p>FreedomCar, Baltimore's established transportation service, has introduced FreedomCar-CONNECT, a concierge program specifically designed to support older adults and their families. The service addresses the increasing administrative burdens that often consume family visits and diminish quality time.</p><p>The program pairs each household with a dedicated Client Advocate who manages day-to-day tasks that become challenging with aging. Services include scheduling medical appointments, coordinating home repairs, organizing paperwork, arranging wellness services, and setting up technology. This comprehensive approach allows families to focus on meaningful interactions rather than logistical concerns.</p><p>Founder Mark Thistel explained the motivation behind the service, noting that adult children frequently find their visits with aging parents dominated by errands and problem-solving. The program aims to restore that valuable time while ensuring older adults maintain independence and connection.</p><p>Debbie Kennison serves as the inaugural Client Advocate in the Baltimore metropolitan area. Her role begins with a two-hour in-home assessment to identify needs and priorities, followed by weekly visits for ongoing coordination and support. Kennison emphasizes the personal nature of the service, describing her approach as listening to stories and finding creative solutions to make daily life smoother.</p><p>The philosophy behind FreedomCar-CONNECT aligns with the growing national concept of "joyspan"â€”focusing on life enjoyment rather than just longevity. By reducing daily stressors and fostering connections, the service helps clients concentrate on experiences and relationships that bring fulfillment.</p><p>Available services extend beyond traditional transportation to include errand-running, senior care consultation, property maintenance, billing assistance, physical therapy, restorative yoga, professional organization, wellness services, meal planning, dietary counseling, and home technology assistance. The program operates on a membership basis and can be tailored to individual requirements.

This initiative addresses a critical gap in senior care services, particularly as the aging population continues to grow and families face increasing demands on their time and resources.</p><p>For business and technology leaders, the CONNECT program demonstrates how established companies can leverage their existing infrastructure and expertise to expand into adjacent service markets. The program's comprehensive approach to senior support services shows potential for scalability and replication in other markets facing similar demographic challenges.</p>
