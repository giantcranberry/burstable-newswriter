<p>The Lighting Design Group, an Emmy Award-winning leader in broadcast lighting design, has announced its official expansion into the United Kingdom and broader European market. The company brings its full-service capabilities and 35-year legacy to new partners across Europe, addressing the rising demand for high-quality, global-ready broadcast production services.</p><p>LDG's extensive track record includes major international projects such as studio launches, live sporting events including the Olympics, and high-profile religious events. Steve Brill, President of LDG, stated that the company is entering the UK and Europe with intention rather than hesitation, emphasizing that clients need lighting partners who understand the scale, complexity, and speed of global production.</p><p>The company offers a comprehensive suite of services including broadcast lighting for news studios and sports coverage, corporate broadcast studio design, remote and live event support, and systems integration for new studio builds and renovations. Dennis Size, Executive Vice President of Design at LDG, described lighting as a language that the company speaks fluently, designing light that shapes mood, enhances storytelling, and delivers consistency across every frame.</p><p>LDG's operational expansion includes local lighting design crews and dedicated partners across the UK and Europe, enabling the company to launch new projects on demand while maximizing budget efficiency. The operations team provides seamless, turnkey solutions across borders and time zones, featuring world-class local teams, end-to-end equipment logistics, and best-in-class crewing support.</p><p>Sheryl Wisniewski, Vice President of Operations, emphasized that the company has built its operations to be global-ready, ensuring consistent quality and streamlined deployment for partners producing content from London to Milan. This expansion represents a significant development in the broadcast industry, as international productions increasingly require lighting partners capable of delivering consistent, brand-aligned, and camera-perfect environments across global markets.</p><p>LDG's move into Europe positions the company to better serve broadcast networks, multinational corporations, streaming platforms, and major sports franchises operating in the region. The expansion reflects the growing importance of visual consistency and production quality in an increasingly globalized media landscape, where content must maintain professional standards regardless of geographic location.</p>
