<p>GoHealth Inc. (NASDAQ: GOCO) reported an 11.2% year-over-year decline in net revenues for the second quarter of 2025, totaling $94.0M. This downturn was largely attributed to significant decreases in partner and non-agency revenues, which fell by 44.4% and 79.4%, respectively. Despite these challenges, the company's GoHealth Protect initiative emerged as a bright spot, generating $8.7M in revenue. This performance highlights the company's ability to identify and capitalize on niche opportunities amidst broader market softness.</p><p>In a strategic move to bolster its financial position, GoHealth has secured a new senior secured super priority term loan facility, including $80.0M in new funding. This initiative not only ensures compliance with debt covenants but also earmarks a $250.0M debt basket for future acquisitions. Furthermore, the company has successfully negotiated amendments to its current debt facility, including a reset of financial covenants and a temporary suspension of interest rate payments through 2026. These steps underscore GoHealth's proactive approach to navigating financial challenges and positioning itself for long-term success.</p><p>Despite the revenue decline, GoHealth demonstrated operational efficiency by maintaining a competitive cost of customer acquisition (CAC) at $613, marking a 4.8% improvement year-over-year. The company's focus on enhancing call center productivity, improving agent training, and refining marketing strategies is expected to further drive operational efficiencies. These efforts are particularly crucial as GoHealth prepares for the upcoming Annual Enrollment Period (AEP), a critical time for the health insurance marketplace.</p><p>Stonegate Capital Partners recently updated its coverage on GoHealth, employing an EV/EBITDA comparative analysis to evaluate the company's valuation.
