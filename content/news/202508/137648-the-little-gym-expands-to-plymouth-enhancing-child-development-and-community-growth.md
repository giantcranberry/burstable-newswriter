<p>The Little Gym, a globally recognized child development and gymnastics program, is expanding its reach to Plymouth, with its new facility scheduled to open on August 9, 2025. This expansion is not just a milestone for the brand but a significant boon for the Plymouth community, promising to enrich the lives of children aged four months through 12 years and create 10 new jobs.</p><p>Owned by Pete and Kristen Marshall, the Plymouth location of The Little Gym is born out of the couple's personal positive experiences with the program as young parents. Transitioning from careers in IT and real estate, the Marshalls are now channeling their passion into making a meaningful difference in their community. Their vision is to provide a nurturing space where children can explore their potential and parents can find a supportive network.</p><p>Under the management of Sara Hall, a seasoned gymnastics expert with over two decades of experience, The Little Gym of Plymouth is designed to be more than just a physical activity center. It aims to be a hub for early childhood development, leveraging movement-based learning and imaginative play to enhance coordination, listening skills, and intellectual growth. The facility will offer a variety of programs, including Parent/Child classes, pre-K and grade school gymnastics, Awesome Birthday Bashes, Camps, Parent Survival Nights, and Member Events, all tailored to support physical, cognitive, and social and emotional learning.</p><p>With nearly 400 locations across 31 countries, The Little Gym's mission to lay the foundation for a child's developmental success is well-established. The Plymouth gym, operating from 9am to 7pm daily (closed on Fridays), is poised to become a cornerstone for family development in the area.
