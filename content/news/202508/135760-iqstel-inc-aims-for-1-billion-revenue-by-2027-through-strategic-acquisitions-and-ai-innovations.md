<p>IQSTEL Inc. (NASDAQ: IQST), a multinational telecommunications and technology company, has announced an ambitious plan to reach $1 billion in revenue by 2027. This goal underscores the company's rapid growth and strategic expansion across telecom, fintech, and artificial intelligence (AI) sectors. With operations spanning four continents and a workforce of over 100 employees, IQSTEL has made significant strides through twelve strategic acquisitions since its inception in 2018.</p><p>The company's diverse portfolio includes SwissLink, Smartbiz Telecom, and Qxtel in telecommunications, ITS Blockchain and Global Money One in fintech, and Reality Border in AI, alongside the recent acquisition of Globetopper, a global B2B gift card concierge firm. These acquisitions are central to IQSTEL's strategy to diversify its revenue streams and strengthen its market position.</p><p>Partnerships have also been instrumental in IQSTEL's growth. A notable collaboration involves the deployment of IQSTELâ€™s AIRWEB AI agents to ONAR's account managers, showcasing the company's AI capabilities and opening new high-margin revenue opportunities. Furthermore, the launch of IQ2Call.ai, an AI-powered call center service, targets the lucrative global market estimated at $750 billion.</p><p>Financially, IQSTEL is exceeding expectations, with preliminary revenue for the first half of 2025 reported at $128.8 million, including $27.3 million in June alone. The company is on track to achieve a $400 million annualized revenue run rate in the third quarter and remains confident in meeting its $340 million revenue forecast for 2025. The Globetopper acquisition is expected to contribute $5-6 million monthly starting July, further bolstering IQSTEL's financial performance.</p><p>In addition to revenue growth, IQSTEL has made significant progress in improving its financial health by reducing debt by $6.9 million, or approximately $2 per share, through conversions into common and Series D Preferred Shares. This strategic move not only enhances the company's capital structure but also results in $0.92 million in interest savings, improving cash flow and operational flexibility.</p><p>Litchfield Hills Research has recognized IQSTEL's potential, issuing a buy rating with an $18 per share price target. The research firm highlights the company's strong telecom operations, disciplined merger and acquisition strategy, and the visionary leadership of CEO Leandro Iglesias. With the stock recently trading at just over $9 per share, Litchfield sees considerable upside, attributing the company's success to Iglesias's industry expertise and strategic vision.</p><p>As IQSTEL continues to execute its aggressive growth strategy, its diversified portfolio and financial achievements position it as a significant player in the evolving telecom, fintech, and AI landscapes.
