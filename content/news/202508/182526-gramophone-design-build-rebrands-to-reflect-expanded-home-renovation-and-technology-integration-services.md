<p>Gramophone Design Build, formerly known as Maryland Kitchen Design Center by Gramophone, has completed a strategic rebranding to better align with its expanded service offerings and capabilities. The Hunt Valley, Maryland-based firm now operates under a name that more accurately represents its comprehensive approach to design, construction, and technology integration services.</p><p>The company's evolution from a kitchen and bath showroom to a full-service renovation firm reflects significant growth in capabilities and service offerings. According to Andrew Davis, CEO and Managing Partner, the rebranding allows the company to better represent its comprehensive services while embracing the craftsmanship, design excellence, and innovation that define the Gramophone legacy. The firm now offers home renovations and additions, interior design, smart home integration, custom cabinetry and millwork, and licensed electrical contracting through an integrated team approach.</p><p>The implications of this rebranding extend beyond mere name recognition for the Maryland market. For business leaders and technology professionals, Gramophone's expansion into smart home integration and licensed electrical services represents the growing convergence of traditional construction expertise with advanced technology implementation. The company's ability to manage projects from concept to completion with an in-house team addresses the increasing demand for seamless integration of smart home technologies in residential renovations.</p><p>This development matters to industry observers as it demonstrates how traditional design-build firms are adapting to incorporate technology services, potentially setting a new standard for comprehensive home renovation providers. The integration of licensed electrical contracting with smart home technology services under one roof could streamline project timelines and improve coordination between different aspects of home automation and renovation projects.</p><p>The company will mark the completion of its rebranding with an invite-only event on September 25 in its newly renovated showroom.
