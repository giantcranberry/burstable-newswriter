<p>Transit-oriented development has become a critical component of Florida's urban growth strategy, offering solutions to transportation congestion and housing affordability challenges through cohesive development along key transit corridors. According to Arturo Vasquez, Design Principal and Senior Architect at Stantec, TOD provides an alternative to isolated, parcel-by-parcel developments by promoting integrated growth connected to transit hubs, increasing ridership while reducing inefficient land use and traffic within dense zones.</p><p>Florida's Live Local Act has created a successful formula for TOD implementation by incentivizing increased housing affordability and densities combined with an expedited path for growth in areas already served by transit. The legislation, combined with recent legal approval of unsolicited proposals to public transit agencies, enables developers, architects, and transit agencies to create transformative projects across underutilized public lands without extending the often-lengthy RFP process. This approach unlocks growth quickly through <a href="https://www.stantec.com/en/services/planning-design/p3-development-strategies" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">P3 development strategies</a> that identify and execute development scenarios efficiently.</p><p>Florida's unique geography and climate make it particularly suited for TOD implementation. The network of various transit lines, including Brightline and rapid transit bus corridors, connects key cities and towns efficiently. During hot, humid months, pedestrians benefit from proximity to transit opportunities, spending less time exposed to the elements, while mild months encourage walking, biking, and commuting while enjoying mixed-use services that TODs inherently provide.</p><p>TOD zoning overlays primarily offer density, height, mixed uses, and most importantly—parking reductions. These incentives improve transit access, limit single-car usage, and minimize parking requirements through shared parking techniques and transit use incentives tied to development. The funding is generally tied to transit and mixed-use capital stack offsets, making projects more financially viable for developers.</p><p>Key considerations when designing mixed-use or high-density buildings near transit hubs include creating walkable, connected communities that combine retail, housing at multiple price points, and vibrant public spaces. Developments located within a half mile of major transit hubs offer enhanced streetscapes, pedestrian-friendly plazas, and direct access to reliable transit, which increases property values, drives foot traffic, and supports long-term economic growth.</p><p>Successful TOD integration requires cohesive master planning that begins with placemaking—creating significant public space scenarios where mixed uses can occur with areas dedicated for retail, housing, commerce, and strategic parking integrated into the development. Architecture plays a crucial role in bridging transportation systems with surrounding communities by seamlessly integrating urban design, wayfinding, placemaking, and landscapes for better public use near transit stations and hubs.</p><p>Florida can learn from other cities with strong transit networks, such as California's <a href="https://www.stantec.com/en/projects/united-states-projects/o/oceanside-tod-project" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Oceanside TOD project</a>, where Stantec partnered in a public-private venture that blended master planning, transit integration, landscape, placemaking, and architecture into one vision delivering affordable housing, mixed-use amenities, multimodal connections, and civic facilities within a unified, transit-first community.</p>
