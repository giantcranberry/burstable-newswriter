<p>GreenGen has secured its position on Inc. Magazine's Inc. 5000 list for the second consecutive year, highlighting sustained growth and market leadership in energy and resilience solutions. The annual ranking identifies the nation's fastest-growing privately held businesses, with GreenGen's repeat appearance underscoring the scalability of its business model and values-driven approach.</p><p>CEO and Co-Founder Brad Dockser emphasized that the recognition validates the company's people-first, mission-driven strategy, demonstrating the ability to grow rapidly while maintaining purpose. The achievement extends beyond revenue metrics, as GreenGen has developed an award-winning workplace culture recognized by both Inc. magazine and the Washington Business Journal as a top place to work.</p><p>This year's recognition coincides with two significant milestones for the company. GreenGen was selected as the only small business awarded to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' <a href="https://www.greengen.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">$3 billion ESPC IV contract</a>, enabling support for energy and water modernization efforts across the nation's aging federal building portfolio. Additionally, in collaboration with Conduit Capital U.S. and Climate First Bancorp, the company launched Sustainable Credit Partners, a new green lending program designed to unlock financing for energy efficiency and decarbonization in mid-market commercial buildings.</p><p>These achievements demonstrate how GreenGen is driving impact by embedding sustainability into the full real estate lifecycle and showcasing how the energy transition creates significant value for property owners and investors worldwide. The Inc. 5000 rankings are determined by percentage revenue growth over a three-year period, making consecutive appearances particularly rare and meaningful in the competitive business landscape.</p><p>Dockser added that what sets GreenGen apart is not just the speed of growth but how the company chooses to grow, proving that it's possible to scale with purpose, invest in people, and deliver real financial and climate impact simultaneously. This approach represents a model for sustainable success in the evolving energy and real estate sectors, where environmental responsibility and profitability are increasingly interconnected.</p>
