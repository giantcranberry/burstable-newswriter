<p>Bollinger Innovations, Inc. (NASDAQ: BINI) has announced a $7,500 price reduction for its Mullen ONE and Mullen THREE electric vehicles (EVs), targeting commercial customers. This strategic price adjustment positions the Mullen ONE at a starting price of $27,000 and the Mullen THREE at $61,000, making them more accessible options for businesses considering the transition to electric fleets. The timing of this price cut is pivotal, as it coincides with the availability of a $7,500 credit under the Inflation Reduction Act for deliveries completed by September 30, further reducing the total cost of ownership for commercial buyers.</p><p>The company, formerly known as Mullen Automotive, is capitalizing on this opportunity to enhance its market presence before rebranding these models under the Bollinger Motors name starting with the 2026 model year. Beyond the Mullen ONE and THREE, Bollinger Innovations is broadening its commercial EV lineup with the upcoming Bollinger B4 Class 4 truck and a Class 5 model expected in 2027. These initiatives highlight the company's dedication to offering a wide range of electric vehicles tailored to the U.S. market's needs, supported by its manufacturing facility in Tunica, Mississippi.</p><p>To ensure comprehensive sales and service coverage, Bollinger Innovations has developed a strong dealer network across the United States, including partnerships with Pap√© Kenworth and Randy Marion Auto Group. This network facilitates nationwide access to the Mullen ONE and THREE, enabling businesses to easily adopt these cost-effective and sustainable transportation solutions.
