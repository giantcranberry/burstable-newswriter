<p>Anthony Marinello, president and owner of Tropic Air Charters Inc., has leveraged his 35 years of law enforcement and aviation experience to establish Tropic Air Rescue, the only fully certified helicopter rescue membership program in The Bahamas. This initiative fills a critical void in emergency medical services for both residents and visitors to the island nation.</p><p>The inspiration for Tropic Air Rescue came from a personal emergency experience when Marinello discovered that no helicopter air ambulance service existed in The Bahamas after one of his pilots encountered a passenger having a stroke. I called 10 to 15 air ambulance companies, but none would respond, Marinello explained, highlighting the urgent need for such services. The program offers various membership levels including daily, weekly, monthly, yearly individual and family memberships, as well as marine vessel membership programs for boats and yachts.</p><p>Membership provides access to emergency rescue helicopter services where injured members are transported to specialized south Florida medical facilities, with costs covered through insurance billing rather than out-of-pocket expenses for members. The service operates 24/7, 365 days a year without government subsidies, relying entirely on membership support to maintain readiness.</p><p>Marinello's aviation safety philosophy emphasizes the importance of twin-engine aircraft and dual-pilot operations despite higher costs. Most operations in the country, around 97%, are done with single engine aircraft. When that engine has a problem, you are going down, he noted, advocating for higher safety standards across the industry. The organization maintains rigorous training standards and empowers crew members to abort missions when risks outweigh potential benefits.</p><p>The establishment of Tropic Air Rescue represents a significant advancement in emergency medical services for The Bahamas, providing critical care transportation that was previously unavailable. Marinello's extensive background, including nearly 5,000 completed rescues during his law enforcement career, informs the program's operational protocols and safety culture. The service has already conducted multiple high-risk U.S. citizen extractions in Haiti and led humanitarian missions following Hurricane Helene in North Carolina.</p><p>For young professionals considering aviation public service careers, Marinello emphasizes the profound satisfaction of life-saving work: There is no greater gift to another than saving their life. The implications for that person and their families are long-lasting and unknown to the future of our world. The program demonstrates how private sector initiatives can address critical public safety gaps in regions lacking comprehensive emergency medical infrastructure.</p>
