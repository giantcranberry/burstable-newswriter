<p>The recent $395 million acquisition of a ten-property retail portfolio by Bain Capital Real Estate and 11North Partners underscores the robust demand for grocery-anchored retail centers in the Southeast. This portfolio, primarily anchored by Publix stores, encompasses over one million square feet across Florida and South Carolina, boasting an impressive occupancy rate of over 93%. This strategic investment mirrors a wider trend in retail real estate, where necessity-based tenants and strong demographic fundamentals are increasingly attracting investors.</p><p>One of the portfolio's standout properties, the New Tampa Center, was sold for $57 million. This 93,666-square-foot retail development is situated in a burgeoning submarket, supported by an affluent local population with an average household income surpassing $157,000. The presence of national brands such as Bank of America, Chipotle, and Starbucks within the center further elevates the portfolio's attractiveness.

These brands are celebrated for their consumer loyalty and consistent sales performance, averaging around $1,000 per square foot in grocery sales across their platform. This acquisition not only solidifies Bain Capital and 11North's presence in essential retail sectors but also underscores their focus on open-air centers that meet enduring consumer needs.</p><p>The portfolio's locations in vibrant retail markets such as Fort Lauderdale, Kissimmee, and Charleston benefit from strong consumer purchasing power and population growth, making them prime targets for retail investment. This transaction exemplifies the enduring appeal of grocery-anchored and open-air retail centers, even as consumer behaviors and economic conditions evolve.</p><p>This deal is indicative of a broader industry shift towards investing in retail assets that promise both stability and growth. The collaboration between Bain Capital and 11North, initiated last year, is poised for further expansion, with plans to acquire high-performing retail properties across the U.S. and Canada. This acquisition not only reaffirms their dedication to the retail sector but also establishes a benchmark for future investments in comparable markets.</p>
