<p>Dusty Cars, Northern California's classic car valuation, appraisal, and buying service, has announced significant updates to its Jaguar-focused services, providing specialized support for owners of rare and collectible models. The company's enhanced <a href="https://dustycars.com/jaguar-valuation-service/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Jaguar valuation service page</a> now reflects classic cars from highly collectible decades, particularly benefiting recipients of inherited Jaguar E-Type, XK120, XK140, or XK150 models who can access detailed valuation and sale information.</p><p>Douglas Berry, founder of Dusty Cars, emphasized the unique appeal of Jaguar vehicles, stating that the brand's specific style remains unmatched by other manufacturers. This distinctive quality continues to drive demand among classic car enthusiasts who actively seek Jaguars for their collections. The company's valuation services cover classic Jaguar models from the 1950s through the 1990s, with particular expertise in rare models like the XK150, of which only approximately 9,382 units were produced between 1957 and 1961.</p><p>The rarity of certain Jaguar models significantly contributes to their sustained market value, making professional appraisal essential for owners who may have inherited vehicles stored for extended periods. Dusty Cars addresses this need by providing thorough appraisals and fast cash offers accessible to both experienced collectors and novice owners seeking to understand their vehicle's worth. Beyond valuation services, the company offers comprehensive support through its <a href="https://dustycars.com/classic-car-storage/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">classic car storage</a> solutions and <a href="https://dustycars.com/consignment-program/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">consignment program</a>, assisting owners with refurbishment, detailing, and proper vehicle preservation.</p><p>This expansion of Jaguar-specific services comes at a time when the brand's historical significance is gaining renewed attention. Following Tata Motors' 2008 acquisition and the subsequent merger with Land Rover, Jaguar's contemporary direction focuses on electric vehicle development. However, enthusiasts remain dedicated to celebrating the luxury sports car's iconic legacy and racing history, creating sustained interest in models from the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s. Dusty Cars' specialized Jaguar valuation services provide crucial market insight for owners navigating this evolving landscape while preserving automotive heritage.</p>
