<p>PowerBank Corporation has secured $1.74 million in funding from the Nova Scotia Department of Environment and Climate Change for three community solar projects through <a href="https://netzeroatlantic.ca" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Net Zero Atlantic's program</a>. The funding supports the Sydney, Brooklyn, and Petpeswick Community Solar projects, representing a significant advancement in renewable energy infrastructure for the region.</p><p>The grant allocation includes $340,000 for the Sydney Solar Project, $440,000 for the Petpeswick Solar Project, and $960,000 for the Brooklyn Solar Project. Ownership of these projects is divided between AI Renewable Flow-through Fund (48%) and either a non-profit organization or Potlotek First Nation (52%), demonstrating a collaborative approach to renewable energy development.</p><p>PowerBank serves as the lead developer and builder, collaborating with Trimac Engineering to deliver the projects. The company brings substantial expertise to Canada's emerging community solar market, having completed more than 50 MW of community solar projects in the United States. This experience positions PowerBank to effectively implement distributed energy solutions that benefit local communities while contributing to environmental goals.</p><p>Community solar projects allow multiple participants to benefit from solar energy generation without requiring individual rooftop installations, making renewable energy more accessible to diverse stakeholders including utilities, commercial entities, industrial operations, municipal organizations, and residential consumers. This development aligns with broader energy transition initiatives across North America, where distributed generation and community-based renewable projects are becoming increasingly important components of energy infrastructure.</p><p>The projects contribute to PowerBank's portfolio of renewable and clean energy developments, which includes solar and Battery Energy Storage System projects across multiple markets. The successful securing of this funding highlights the viability of public-private partnerships in advancing renewable energy goals and demonstrates the economic opportunities presented by the transition to cleaner energy sources.</p><p>As communities and governments prioritize sustainability, projects like these serve as models for collaborative approaches to energy development that balance environmental responsibility with economic practicality. This initiative supports Atlantic Canada's goal of achieving carbon neutrality by 2050 while creating tangible benefits for local communities through accessible renewable energy solutions.</p>
