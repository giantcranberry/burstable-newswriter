<p>NeARabl Inc., a New York-based computer vision AI company, has achieved a significant breakthrough in spatial imaging technology that promises to revolutionize construction and engineering workflows. The company's Infrastructure AI tool now delivers building scan accuracy of under 30mm, a level of precision that matches professional laser scanning equipment while using standard mobile devices.</p><p>Chief Technology Officer Jin Chen explained that the technology originated from a National Science Foundation-funded research project at CUNY focused on indoor navigational mapping, with initial development documented at https://www.nsf.gov. "What once was an academic lab project has now become a modern jobsite tool," Chen stated, noting the platform's evolution from an assistive solution for people with low vision to a comprehensive commercial product serving construction, architecture, and facility management industries.</p><p>The technology's importance stems from its ability to transform mobile devices into highly precise mapping tools that capture spaces within centimeters of accuracy. This innovation addresses critical industry pain points by reducing costly rework, improving collaboration between architects and engineers, and accelerating project timelines without sacrificing quality. Chen emphasized that "AI's influence isn't just in efficiency gains; it's fundamentally reshaping the project lifecycle, from design to delivery."</p><p>NeARabl's solution eliminates the need for expensive hardware, making deployment fast and scalable for professionals including architects, mechanical engineers, electricians, and plumbing specialists. The tool helps users visualize design ideas and infrastructure data with unprecedented precision, allowing teams to see what should be built before breaking ground. This capability significantly minimizes the risk of costly mistakes during the planning stage of infrastructure projects.</p><p>The recent accuracy breakthrough was achieved through proprietary methods that overcome fundamental limitations in mobile hardware. Chen explained that current mobile devices like iPhones have depth sensors, IMUs, and cameras that "were never designed for engineering-grade measurement," but her team developed techniques to push beyond these constraints. The technology's development was supported by multiple organizations including the Air Force Research Labs, with research partnerships documented at https://www.afresearchlab.com, Homeland Security, and Bentley Systems Inc.</p><p>This advancement represents a paradigm shift for the construction and engineering industries, potentially democratizing access to high-precision spatial imaging technology that was previously available only to large firms with substantial equipment budgets. The ability to achieve professional-grade accuracy using standard mobile devices could accelerate digital transformation across multiple sectors while reducing barriers to entry for smaller firms and independent professionals.</p>
