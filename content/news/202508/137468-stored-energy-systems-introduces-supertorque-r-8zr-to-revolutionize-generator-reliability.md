<p>Stored Energy Systems (SENS) has introduced the SuperTorque® 8ZR, a DC genset engine starting system, marking a significant leap forward in generator reliability and uptime for mission-critical environments. This innovation is particularly relevant for sectors such as data centers, hospitals, and oil and gas operations, where generator failure is not an option. The SuperTorque® 8ZR addresses the leading cause of standby generator failures—the starting battery system—as identified by industry leaders Caterpillar and Cummins.</p><p>The SuperTorque® 8ZR distinguishes itself by offering a fully integrated, factory-tested solution that not only minimizes failure points but also reduces space requirements by up to 90% compared to conventional setups. With configurations to suit various needs, the system comes with a 10-year full replacement warranty, requires zero maintenance, and is designed with the environment in mind, boasting 96% lower lifetime greenhouse gas emissions. Furthermore, it offers over 50% cost savings over a decade, presenting an attractive low total cost of ownership.</p><p>Olen Scott, Chief Revenue Officer for SENS, emphasized the system's efficiency, noting, 'The 8ZR simplifies installation by cutting down on on-site connections and manual integration steps. This efficiency-driven solution not only eliminates potential failure points but also saves approximately eight labor hours per generator enclosure.' Produced at SENS's ISO 9001:2015-certified facility in Longmont, Colorado, the 8ZR is a ready-to-deploy, purpose-built solution that meets the critical infrastructure demands of today's power resilience needs.</p><p>For organizations prioritizing uptime, seeking to reduce operational complexity, and facing growing demands for reliable power, the SuperTorque® 8ZR offers a groundbreaking solution.
