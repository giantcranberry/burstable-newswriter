<p>Lantern Pharma (NASDAQ: LTRN), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company, has made notable strides in its oncology drug development programs and the enhancement of its artificial intelligence (AI) platform, RADR(R), as reported in its second-quarter results for 2025. The company has achieved complete responses in patients from two clinical trials: LP-300 for advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and LP-284 for refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. These developments highlight the efficacy of Lantern Pharma's targeted therapies in treating difficult cancer types.</p><p>Further advancing its pipeline, Lantern Pharma has completed enrollment for the Phase 1a trial of LP-184, a promising drug candidate with FDA Fast Track and multiple Rare Pediatric Disease designations. LP-184 has shown significant survival benefits in models of atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumor (ATRT), setting the stage for Phase 1b/2 studies in high-value indications. The company's innovation is also reflected in its strengthened intellectual property portfolio, including a European patent allowance for LP-284 and the publication of a PCT application for its predictBBB(TM) AI module.</p><p>The RADR(R) platform has been upgraded with the public launch of predictBBB.ai(TM) and a new drug combination prediction module. These improvements are designed to speed up the discovery and development of oncology drugs by utilizing over 200 billion oncology-focused data points and a library of more than 200 advanced machine learning algorithms. Lantern Pharma's methodology has drastically cut down the time and cost required to move new drug programs from initial AI insights to first-in-human clinical trials, averaging 2-3 years and approximately $1.0 to $2.5 million per program.</p><p>On the financial front, Lantern Pharma reported a decrease in Q2 R&D expenses to $3.1 million from $3.9 million year-over-year, while G&A expenses saw a slight increase to $1.6 million from $1.5 million. The company's net loss improved to $4.33 million from $4.96 million in the previous year. With cash, equivalents, and marketable securities amounting to $15.9 million at the quarter's end, Lantern Pharma is in a strong position to support its operations into June 2026.
