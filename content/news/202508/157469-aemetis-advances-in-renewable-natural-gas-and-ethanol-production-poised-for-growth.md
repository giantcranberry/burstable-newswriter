<p>Aemetis, Inc. (Nasdaq: AMTX) has made significant strides in its renewable natural gas (RNG) and ethanol production capabilities, as detailed in a recent update by Stonegate Capital Partners. The company's Dairy RNG platform is now in a high-growth phase, with eleven digesters producing 106,400 MMBtu of RNG in the second quarter of 2025, contributing $3.1 million in revenue. This expansion is supported by regulatory approvals, including seven new Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS) pathways approved by the California Air Resources Board (CARB), enhancing the value of LCFS credits with a blended CI score of -384.</p><p>The company's RNG production capacity is expected to reach 550,000 MMBtus by the end of 2025 and expand to 1.0 million MMBtus by the end of 2026. Aemetis has diversified its revenue streams through the sale of RNG molecules, D3 RIN credits, LCFS production tax credits, and section 45Z production tax credits. To date, the company has sold $83 million in Section 48 investment tax credits, generating approximately $70 million in cash, with 45Z monetization anticipated to become a recurring revenue source starting in the third quarter of 2025.</p><p>Commercial advancements include agreements to construct Hâ‚‚S removal and compression units for 15 digesters, facilitating the scale-up towards the 1.0 million MMBtu/year RNG platform by 2026. Additionally, Aemetis has secured 20-year term USDA-guaranteed financing to support this expansion. In its California Ethanol segment, the installation of a $30 million mechanical vapor recompression (MVR) system is projected to reduce natural gas use by 80% and add $32 million in annual cash flow from 2026 onwards, addressing margin-related shutdowns at the Keyes Plant.</p><p>Policy support is a key driver of Aemetis's growth, with the company well-positioned to benefit from the CARB's 20-year LCFS framework, Section 45Z Production Tax Credits, nationwide E15 expansion, and robust low-carbon fuel mandates and incentives. These factors are expected to boost demand for low-carbon fuels and aid Aemetis's refinancing efforts, potentially leading to significant reductions in interest expenses.</p><p>In the second quarter of 2025, Aemetis reported revenue of $52.2 million, marking an increase from the previous quarter but a decrease year-over-year due to lower biodiesel volumes. However, the operating loss improved to $10.7 million from $13.6 million year-over-year, and the net loss narrowed to $23.4 million from $29.2 million. The company's cash position stood at $1.6 million at quarter-end, following $3.6 million in CI-reduction and RNG investments. Future quarters are expected to benefit from 45Z and new LCFS credit revenues, further enhancing Aemetis's financial outlook.</p><p>Stonegate Capital Partners' valuation model for Aemetis, based on a Discounted Cash Flow analysis, suggests a valuation range of $8.30 to $18.77, with a midpoint of $12.39, indicating potential upside for investors as the company continues to leverage the increasing demand for renewable energy solutions.</p>
