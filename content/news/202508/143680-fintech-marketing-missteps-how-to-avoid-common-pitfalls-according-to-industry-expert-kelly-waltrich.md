<p>Fintech companies frequently encounter hurdles in their marketing strategies, often missing key opportunities to engage their target audience and achieve scalable growth. Kelly Waltrich, CEO of Intention.ly, a finserv growth consultancy, has identified the ten most common marketing mistakes within the fintech sector. Her expertise, derived from advising rapidly growing companies in the industry, provides a roadmap for avoiding these pitfalls.</p><p>One of the primary errors fintechs make is postponing investment in brand development. Waltrich posits that a strong brand is synonymous with performance, crucial for accelerating sales cycles and fostering trust. Another significant oversight is the misalignment of messaging with the audience's needs, which can severely impact trust and engagement levels. Waltrich also highlights the underuse of executive personal brands and the overlooking of martech and data infrastructure as critical areas needing attention.</p><p>Understanding the enterprise sales cycle is another area where fintechs often stumble. Waltrich cautions against the application of small and medium-sized business (SMB) marketing tactics to these more protracted and complex processes. She also advises against an over-dependence on paid acquisition, recommending a more balanced marketing mix that includes organic channels, SEO, and thought leadership initiatives.</p><p>Clarity in product messaging is another common challenge for fintechs. Waltrich suggests simplifying messaging to ensure it resonates effectively with the intended audience. Moreover, she underscores the importance of establishing a solid foundation before launching to market, which includes a well-defined ideal customer profile (ICP) and a cohesive go-to-market (GTM) strategy.</p><p>Lastly, Waltrich emphasizes the critical role of a distribution strategy for content, pointing out that even the highest quality content can fail to make an impact without adequate visibility. She concludes that effective marketing hinges on precision and alignment with the audience's decision-making process, rather than merely focusing on the volume of content produced.
