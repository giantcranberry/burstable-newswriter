<p>Solowin Holdings (NASDAQ: SWIN) has launched its Dubai Operations Center and initiated the application process for a Category 3C asset management license from the Dubai International Financial Centre. This strategic expansion builds upon the company's recent collaboration with CITIC Construction in Saudi Arabia and significantly extends its compliant financial services footprint throughout the Middle East region.</p><p>The company selected DIFC for its regulatory advantages, particularly the mutual recognition framework with Hong Kong's Securities and Futures Commission, which could streamline the approval process to as little as three months. This regulatory efficiency enables faster market entry and operational deployment compared to other financial centers. Additionally, Solowin signed a memorandum of understanding with a UAE-based enterprise to accelerate market penetration through established client networks and local expertise.</p><p>CEO Peter Lok emphasized that the new Dubai hub strengthens financial connectivity between the Middle East and Asia, supporting the company's vision for creating a cross-regional digital financial silk road. This expansion represents a significant step in bridging traditional finance with emerging digital asset ecosystems across key global markets. The move aligns with growing demand for integrated financial solutions that span both conventional and digital asset classes in the rapidly evolving Middle Eastern financial landscape.</p><p>The Dubai operations center will leverage Solowin's existing regulatory framework, including its Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission licensed subsidiaries with full digital asset capabilities. This establishes a comprehensive regulatory foundation for operating across multiple jurisdictions while maintaining compliance standards. The company's vertically integrated, enterprise-grade platform will deliver traditional finance services, real-world asset tokenization, and global digital payment solutions through the new Middle Eastern hub.</p><p>This expansion comes at a time when Middle Eastern financial markets are experiencing rapid growth in both traditional and digital asset adoption. The strategic positioning in Dubai provides Solowin with access to one of the world's fastest-growing financial regions while maintaining strong connections to Asian markets. The company's approach reflects the increasing convergence of traditional and decentralized finance systems in global financial services.</p>
