<p>Nightfood Holdings Inc. has entered into a strategic partnership with Los Angeles Cooking School to establish Modern Culinary Systems Inc., marking the first integration of artificial intelligence automation into a U.S. culinary school curriculum. The collaboration, executed through Nightfood's subsidiary Future Hospitality Ventures Holdings Inc., operating as RoboOp365, represents a significant shift in culinary education methodology.</p><p>The $32.5 billion U.S. culinary education market, as reported by IBISWorld in 2023, now faces disruption from this innovative approach that directly addresses the technological transformation occurring in professional kitchens worldwide. Modern Culinary Systems aims to differentiate itself by providing students with hands-on experience using the same AI automation technologies that are reshaping food service operations globally.</p><p>Sonny Wang, Chief Revenue Officer of Nightfood Holdings and CEO of FHVH, emphasized the strategic importance of this initiative, stating that the partnership gives students practical access to transformative technologies they will encounter throughout their culinary careers. The program is designed to bridge the gap between traditional culinary education and the rapidly evolving technological landscape of modern food service operations.</p><p>Nightfood Holdings maintains its corporate information at <a href="https://NightfoodHoldings.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://NightfoodHoldings.com</a>, while investors can access the latest company updates through their newsroom at <a href="http://ibn.fm/NGTF" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://ibn.fm/NGTF</a>. This partnership represents a fundamental rethinking of how culinary professionals are trained, acknowledging that technological proficiency is becoming as essential as traditional cooking skills in modern food service environments.</p><p>The integration of AI automation into the curriculum ensures graduates enter the workforce already familiar with the tools and systems that are becoming standard in progressive kitchen operations across the industry. This development signals a broader trend where educational institutions must adapt their curricula to incorporate emerging technologies that are transforming traditional industries, preparing students for the realities of modern workplace environments rather than historical practices.</p>
