<p>Terra Innovatum Srl and GSR III Acquisition Corp. have achieved substantial milestones in the licensing process for the SOLO Micro-Modular Reactor, currently under review by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission. The company submitted its Regulatory Engagement Plan to the NRC in January 2025, establishing a structured framework for regulatory interactions under the non-power reactor licensing pathway outlined in NUREG-1537.</p><p>The company has maintained consistent progress according to its planned timetable, advancing regulatory discussions with the agency. Multiple technical documents, including white papers and topical reports, have been submitted and formally discussed with NRC staff. This stepwise approach enables the NRC to evaluate key technical and safety elements earlier in the process, providing detailed insight into the design and safety features while streamlining the overall review.</p><p>A critical development occurred with the submission of the Principal Design Criteria topical report, which defines the fundamental safety and design requirements forming the basis for the reactor's licensing review. Following its readiness review, the NRC accepted the report for full technical evaluation. In a formal letter dated July 30, 2025, the NRC indicated its intent to complete the review process by the end of 2025 and issue a Safety Evaluation of the PDC report by April 2026.</p><p>The SOLO MMR represents a significant advancement in nuclear technology as a 1 MWe, helium-cooled reactor designed to operate with commercially available low-enriched uranium fuel. Its inherent safety characteristics, modular construction, and simplified operations provide a cost-effective, scalable solution for industrial users requiring reliable heat and power. Unlike traditional nuclear systems, SOLO can be deployed off-grid, supports flexible siting with a small land footprint, and offers simplified maintenance through factory fabrication and modular replacement.</p><p>The reactor incorporates embedded Safeguards-by-Design, ensuring that proliferation resistance and security considerations are integrated at the earliest stages of development. This approach strengthens compliance with international non-proliferation requirements and facilitates regulatory acceptance across diverse markets from the United States to Europe and beyond. The technology addresses pressing global energy demands with applications ranging from data centers and remote communities to large-scale industrial operations in hard-to-abate sectors like cement production, oil and gas, steel manufacturing, and mining.
