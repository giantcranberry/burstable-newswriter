<p>Hästens, the Swedish bedmaker with over 170 years of heritage, has opened its third South Florida location with the debut of Hästens Aventura at the new luxury shopping center Esplanade at Aventura. The showroom introduces an innovative sleep spa concept alongside its collection of handcrafted, all-natural beds, positioning sleep as a critical component of wellness.</p><p>The expansion reflects increasing consumer demand for premium sleep solutions, with owner Juan Quintero noting that investment in rest is now regarded with the same importance as fitness and nutrition. The Aventura location will showcase Hästens' full range of beds, including models like the Maranga, Herlewing, Eala, 2000T, drēmer, Vividus, and the customizable Grand Vividus, which can exceed six figures in price. Each bed is crafted from natural materials such as horsehair, cotton, wool, and flax, designed for optimal comfort, breathability, and body responsiveness.</p><p>Beyond traditional retail, Hästens Aventura functions as an immersive wellness destination. Guests can engage in private consultations, test beds in a tranquil environment enhanced by guided meditation, sound baths, essential oils, and sleep masks, and receive advice from an on-site sleep expert. The location will also host educational programs and community events focused on the connection between sleep and overall health.</p><p>The grand opening in September will invite the public to experience Hästens' offerings firsthand, with event details to be announced. As demand for high-end sleep products continues to grow, the new showroom aims to make restorative sleep accessible to more residents and visitors, reinforcing the brand's role in promoting well-being through superior rest.
