<p>Goliath Resources Limited, a strategic holding of McEwen Inc., has reported significant assay results from its Surebet discovery located on the 100% controlled Golddigger Property in British Columbia's Golden Triangle. Drill hole GD-25-337 returned 10.60 grams per tonne gold over 22.82 meters, including a higher-grade section of 15.19 g/t Au over 15.71 meters. The results also revealed exceptional subintervals of 37.28 g/t Au over 3.36 meters and 36.11 g/t Au over 3.08 meters.</p><p>The continued delivery of exceptional high-grade gold results at Surebet reinforces its potential as one of the most important new discoveries in the Golden Triangle since the renowned Eskay Creek mine. The Golden Triangle region of northwestern British Columbia has historically been one of Canada's most productive mining districts, and discoveries of this magnitude could signal renewed investment and development opportunities in the area. The full press release detailing these results is available at <a href="https://ibn.fm/PfKa3" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://ibn.fm/PfKa3</a>.</p><p>Goliath Resources has maintained an aggressive drilling program, having completed 65 holes totaling 45,000 meters this season with approximately 50 holes and 15,000 meters remaining. The company is on track to complete its up to 60,000-meter 2025 program with nine rigs currently active. This substantial drilling effort demonstrates the company's commitment to thoroughly exploring the property's potential and provides investors with confidence in the systematic approach to resource definition.</p><p>The implications of these results extend beyond Goliath Resources to its strategic investor McEwen Inc., which provides shareholders with exposure to gold, copper, and silver assets across the Americas. Successful developments in strategic holdings like Goliath contribute to McEwen's overall portfolio value and diversification strategy. For more information about McEwen Inc., investors can access the company's newsroom at <a href="https://ibn.fm/MUX" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://ibn.fm/MUX</a>.</p><p>The continued success at Surebet could potentially lead to future development decisions, additional investment, or strategic partnerships that would benefit both companies and their shareholders. These developments are particularly noteworthy given the current global demand for gold and the ongoing search for new, high-quality deposits that can support future production in stable mining jurisdictions like Canada. The results position the Surebet discovery as a significant contributor to the future gold supply chain in a geopolitically stable region.</p>
