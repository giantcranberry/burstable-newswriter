<p>The latest Q2 ITS Logistics US Distribution and Fulfillment Index, powered by Cresa, highlights a tightening in the warehousing and logistics sector, with vacancy rates reaching 7.1%, the highest since 2014. This development, coupled with the first contraction in warehousing capacity in over a year, underscores the growing challenges for businesses reliant on these services. Ryan Martin, President of Distribution and Fulfillment at ITS Logistics, advises securing viable space promptly to mitigate the anticipated pressure on capacity and costs.</p><p>Inventory costs have surged to 80.9 on the Logistics Manager Index, marking the highest level in over two years. This increase is attributed to rising labor, storage, and insurance expenses. Conversely, the Producer Price Index for Warehousing and Storage saw a 5.1% decline from March, reflecting weakened pricing power among warehouse operators. These trends are critical for businesses to monitor as they plan for the upcoming seasonal inventory builds and consumer demand spikes.</p><p>According to the <a href='https://www.cushmanwakefield.com' rel='nofollow' target='_blank'>Cushman & Wakefield</a> Q2 2025 U.S. Industrial Market Report, national net absorption remained stable at 29.6 million square feet, while new completions plummeted to a five-year low of 71.5 million square feet, a 45% decrease year-over-year. This data, along with the highest warehouse vacancy levels in over a decade reported by the <a href='https://www.wsj.com' rel='nofollow' target='_blank'>Wall Street Journal</a>, highlights the difficulty in securing modern, strategically located warehouse space that meets today's supply chain demands.</p><p>The Logistics Manager Index, a survey of logistics professionals on key economic indicators within the supply chain, averaged 59.4 in the second quarter, indicating ongoing expansion. However, June saw warehousing capacity drop to 47.8, the first contraction since early 2023. Despite this, utilization rates remained robust at 62.2, and warehousing prices stayed high at 68.3, driven by the demand for efficient space.</p><p>Following tariff-induced stockpiling in the first half of 2025, inventory levels are beginning to stabilize. Larger shippers are maintaining buffer stocks, whereas small to mid-sized firms are adopting leaner inventory models. This adjustment has led to a notable decline in import volumes and reduced activity at fulfillment and retail centers, as downstream inventory readings suggest.</p><p>Additional findings from the Q2 2025 Index include a nearly 20% month-over-month decrease in U.S. goods imports in April, the most significant single-month drop since 1992, and average warehouse wages now surpassing $19 an hour, a 40% to 50% increase over the past five years. These developments are fueling interest in automation and underscoring the dynamic challenges and opportunities within the logistics and warehousing industry.</p>
