<p>Bluebox Smart Ice and Water has selected Trevelino/Keller as its strategic communications partner to launch the packaged ice industry's first on-premise ice and water vending solution operating under an Ice-as-a-Service model. This partnership addresses long-standing operational challenges in an industry traditionally plagued by inefficiencies and high costs for retailers.</p><p>The traditional ice system forces retailers to contend with costly problems including late or missed deliveries, damaged products, theft, and bulky freezers that occupy valuable retail space that could be used for higher-margin items. Bluebox's innovative approach eliminates these challenges by removing upfront costs, equipment purchases, and maintenance responsibilities while handling all delivery, installation, and servicing through their automated system.</p><p>Ben Gaskill, CEO of Bluebox Smart Ice and Water, emphasized the strategic importance of the partnership, stating that Trevelino/Keller's experience with disruptive brands will help position Bluebox's leadership team as industry experts while generating leads and increasing online visibility. The agency will implement a multi-channel strategy combining public relations and growth marketing efforts, including earned and paid media, content development, SEO, and lead generation.</p><p>Dean Trevelino, co-CCEO of Trevelino/Keller, drew parallels between Bluebox's disruptive potential and his agency's previous work with Carvana, which transformed the used car buying industry. Trevelino noted that Bluebox is positioned to similarly revolutionize how convenience stores and grocery stores sell ice, ultimately changing consumer purchasing behavior in the process.</p><p>The Bluebox system features patented single-moving-part dispensing technology called VersaVendTM, which provides enterprises with a scalable, self-serve, space-neutral solution that requires virtually no labor and operates 24/7. Retailers earn revenue through a share model each time customers purchase ice or water without ever managing inventory, thereby maximizing their retail footprint profitability. This eco-friendly vending solution represents a significant shift from traditional ice distribution methods that have remained largely unchanged for decades.</p><p>Trevelino/Keller, which recently acquired Marsden Marketing as part of its growth marketing expansion, brings substantial experience in elevating brands and driving measurable results across multiple industry segments. The agency's comprehensive scope of work for Bluebox includes developing and executing a strategic launch plan, securing consistent media coverage, providing growth marketing support, and managing social media channels with engaging content to reach key decision-makers in the convenience store industry and beyond.</p>
