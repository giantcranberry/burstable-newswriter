<p>BitFrontier Capital Holdings, Inc. (OTC: BFCH), under its operating name EVERMIND Holdings, Inc., has taken a decisive step towards strengthening its position in the cognitive health and wellness industry by entering into a binding Letter of Intent (LOI) to acquire ERApeutics, LLC. The acquisition, valued at $4,000,000, involves the issuance of 400,000,000 restricted common shares at $0.01 per share, showcasing BFCH's dedication to broadening its market presence.</p><p>The EVERMIND™ beverage platform, a physician-formulated, plant-based protein shake, is designed to enhance brain health with immediate and long-term benefits. Its unique selling points include shelf stability, scientific validation, and readiness for commercial launch. The deal encompasses six proprietary nootropic and adaptogenic formulations, an R&D pipeline, academic research, trademarks, and a fully integrated e-commerce platform accessible at <a href='https://thinkevermind.com' rel='nofollow' target='_blank'>https://thinkevermind.com</a>.</p><p>Dr. Jordan Balencic, CEO of BFCH, highlighted the strategic importance of EVERMIND™, likening its potential influence on cognitive health to Celsius's impact on metabolism. This acquisition is expected to enhance BFCH's financial health by incorporating intellectual property-backed assets and supporting the company's strategy for an OTCQB uplisting. This development comes after BFCH successfully eliminated over $2 million in toxic convertible debt, reducing its total liabilities to under $94,000.</p><p>The functional beverage market is experiencing rapid growth, with industry giants like Keurig Dr Pepper and Coca-Cola making significant investments, underscoring the sector's lucrative potential. EVERMIND™ positions BFCH to leverage this trend with its distinctive, brain-focused product offerings. The transaction is anticipated to conclude within 60 to 90 days, subject to due diligence and final documentation. Following the acquisition, EVERMIND™ will function as a wholly owned subsidiary of EVERMIND Labs, with possibilities for future spin-offs.</p><p>For further insights into the acquisition and BFCH's strategic vision, interested parties can explore the pitch at <a href='https://evermindholdings.com/evermind-beverage/' rel='nofollow' target='_blank'>https://evermindholdings.com/evermind-beverage/</a>.
