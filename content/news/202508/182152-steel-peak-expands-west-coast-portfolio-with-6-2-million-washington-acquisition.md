<p>Steel Peak, a commercial real estate investment firm specializing in industrial outdoor storage properties, has acquired its ninth West Coast property with the $6.2 million purchase of a Pacific, Washington facility. The acquisition at 1503 Thornton Ave SW represents the company's second Seattle-area property this year and demonstrates its aggressive expansion strategy since its founding in January 2024.</p><p>The 2.40-acre property features immediate access to Highway 167 and the Ports of Seattle and Tacoma, making it strategically valuable for industrial users. The site includes a 3,000-square-foot maintenance shop with 800 square feet of office space and more than two acres of graveled and partially paved yard space ideal for outdoor storage and contractor operations. The property is zoned for contractor yards, building material providers, equipment rental, and vehicle maintenance.</p><p>Pasha Johnson, Steel Peak Co-Founder, emphasized the strategic importance of the acquisition, stating that sites like 1503 Thornton Ave SW are irreplaceable assets that provide the functional yard and shop space industrial service users need but rarely find available. The company is building a meaningful presence in the Seattle market with additional properties in the pipeline and is committed to establishing a long-term foothold in the Kent Valley and surrounding submarkets.</p><p>Blake Rodgers, Steel Peak Principal, highlighted the market dynamics driving demand for industrial outdoor storage properties. Demand from construction-related users, contractors, and equipment rental companies continues to outpace supply, with very few sites offering a balance of shop space and large, secure yard areas. Rising infrastructure spending, combined with limited new development and high replacement costs, ensures long-term rent growth for functional IOS assets according to industry analysis available at <a href="https://www.steelpeakproperties.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.steelpeakproperties.com</a>.</p><p>Thad Mallory, SIOR, and Cam Warren of Newmark represented both Steel Peak and the private seller in the transaction. Steel Peak will continue to seek IOS investment opportunities throughout the Western U.S. with capitalized values ranging from $3 million to $50 million, investing directly and in partnership with institutional and high-net-worth investors.</p>
