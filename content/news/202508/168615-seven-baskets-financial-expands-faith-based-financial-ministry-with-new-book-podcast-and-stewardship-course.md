<p>Justin Daymude, founder of Seven Baskets Financial, has expanded his faith-based financial ministry with multiple new resources designed to help Christians apply biblical principles to their financial lives. The expansion includes the release of his new book 'Building Your Storehouse: Thriving in God's Economy' published in 2025, along with The Stewardship Course online training program and The Seed & Harvest Podcast: Faith, Freedom and Finance.</p><p>The book serves as a practical guide that equips believers with biblical financial principles and strategies rooted in Daymude's philosophy from Deuteronomy 8:18, which emphasizes that God gives believers the power to create wealth to fulfill His covenant purposes. This approach combines scripture with practical financial strategies, reflecting the conviction that everything belongs to the Lord and should be managed with both faith and wisdom.</p><p>Complementing the book is The Stewardship Course, available at https://sevenbasketsfinancial.com, an online training program covering biblical financial principles, debt management, asset building, and storehouse creation. Participants learn to chart their money flow, create personal financial blueprints, eliminate unnecessary debt, and develop strategies for building future wealth. The course provides both practical and spiritual tools for responsible financial management in all areas of life.</p><p>Daymude has also launched The Seed & Harvest Podcast, accessible on platforms including <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Apple Podcasts</a> and <a href="https://spotify.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Spotify</a>. The podcast features conversations at the intersection of faith and money, with guest interviews covering Christian stewardship, generosity, and entrepreneurship from a kingdom perspective. Episodes include discussions of the Building Your Storehouse concepts and Daymude's appearances on other shows.</p><p>These initiatives build upon Seven Baskets Financial's existing Debt-Free Life program, which guides clients in escaping debt burdens. Daymude's teaching is informed by his personal experience of recovering financially after losing everything to debt and poor stewardship. His message emphasizes that financial success, when reclaimed through biblical principles, can be used to advance Gospel purposes and create spiritual and material blessings.</p><p>The expansion represents a growing movement among Christian financial educators who integrate faith-based principles with practical money management strategies. By addressing both the spiritual and practical aspects of finances, these resources aim to help believers break free from financial bondage while maintaining a biblical perspective on wealth and stewardship. This approach has significant implications for Christian communities seeking to align their financial practices with their spiritual values.</p>
