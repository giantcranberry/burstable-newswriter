<p>Woodleigh Chase, an Erickson Senior Living community in Fairfax, Va., is setting a new standard for senior living transitions through its personalized Planning and Moving Consultant services. Spearheaded by consultant Melissa Bates, the program offers comprehensive support, from space planning to connecting residents with vetted real estate agents and downsizing experts. This initiative is designed to alleviate the stress associated with moving to a senior living community, making the transition as smooth as possible for new residents.</p><p>The effectiveness of these services is exemplified by David and Jean Marble, who recently moved to Woodleigh Chase. By leveraging their Priority List membership, transferred from another Erickson community, Greenspring, the Marbles were able to select their residence in January 2023 and move in by April 2024. They benefited from exclusive events and resources, including moving and downsizing sessions, and a personal home visit from Bates to plan their new living space. The couple's experience underscores the value of early planning and the personalized support offered by Woodleigh Chase.</p><p>Central to the program's success is the Erickson Realty and Moving Services, which not only simplifies the moving process but also provides access to a network of trusted professionals. This network is carefully vetted each year to ensure high-quality service. Additionally, the Move On UsÂ® program offers up to a $2,000 credit in qualified moving expenses when using a program-approved real estate agent, further easing the financial burden of relocation.</p><p>The Marbles' story highlights the seamless transition facilitated by Woodleigh Chase's services. With the assistance of preferred professionals, they sold their former home in Gainesville, Va., in just one weekend and smoothly transitioned into their new community. The ongoing support from Bates and the community's sales director, Nahid Young, ensured a stress-free process, allowing the Marbles to quickly adapt to their new lifestyle.</p><p>Now fully settled, the Marbles are enjoying the vibrant community life at Woodleigh Chase, from diverse dining options to recreational activities like swimming and volunteering. Their experience illustrates the critical role of personalized support and early planning in maximizing the benefits of senior living communities.
