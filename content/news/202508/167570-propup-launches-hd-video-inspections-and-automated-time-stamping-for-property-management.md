<p>PropUp has launched significant upgrades to its Inspection App featuring high-definition video inspections and automated time-stamped photo capture, developed in response to client needs within 31 days. The new capabilities allow maintenance teams to document property conditions with unprecedented detail and verification, directly addressing accuracy and efficiency challenges in multi-family and single-family rental operations.</p><p>The HD video inspection feature enables unlimited video documentation for move-outs, preventative maintenance, asset tracking, and incident reports within the mobile app workflow. According to company data, this innovation reduces typical inspection times from 30 minutes to just 3 minutes while maintaining comprehensive detail. More significantly, the video capture reduces technician callbacks by over 50% by providing diagnostic-level information during initial inspections.</p><p>William Gottfried, CEO of PropUp, emphasized the customer-driven development approach. The simultaneous introduction of automated time-stamping for all in-app photos provides operators with verified documentation of inspection timing and conditions. This feature helps differentiate internally captured evidence from external uploads, creating a transparent audit trail that strengthens dispute resolution capabilities.</p><p>The combination of video and timestamped evidence addresses longstanding challenges in property management regarding documentation accuracy and resident accountability. The rapid development cycle, completed in just 31 days from concept to launch, was initiated at the request of Point Guard Management. Tim Farha, President of Point Guard Management, noted the unusual responsiveness.</p><p>These enhancements integrate with PropUp's full maintenance and facilities suite, which connects with residential property management software to track performance metrics, centralize operations, and reduce vacancy losses. The company's platform, available at <a href="https://www.gopropup.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.gopropup.com</a>, focuses on operational efficiency tools designed specifically for property managers and owner operators across the United States and Canada.</p>
