<p>A recent study by WalletHub has shed light on the states projected to have the most underprivileged children in 2025, highlighting significant disparities in child welfare across the United States. The research, which analyzed all 50 states and the District of Columbia across 25 key indicators of neediness, including poverty rates, food insecurity, and healthcare access, places New Mexico at the top of the list, followed by Alaska and Louisiana.</p><p>The findings reveal alarming statistics, such as Louisiana's child food-insecurity rate being double that of Massachusetts, the state with the lowest rate. Mississippi reports the highest rate of infant deaths, nearly triple that of New Hampshire, while West Virginia has the highest share of children in foster care, 13.8 times more than New Jersey. Texas stands out for having the highest percentage of uninsured children, a rate 7.9 times higher than in Massachusetts, which, paradoxically, has the highest share of maltreated children, 11.3 times more than New Jersey.</p><p>These disparities underscore the urgent need for comprehensive strategies to address child poverty and improve access to essential services. The study serves as a critical resource for policymakers, advocates, and communities striving to ensure a brighter future for all children.
