<p>Pharos Brands has introduced THC-infused beverage kegs statewide in Wisconsin, positioning the state at the forefront of cannabis beverage innovation. The blood orange lime flavored kegs contain microdosed hemp-derived THC beverages designed for social consumption, representing a major evolution from packaged cans to on-premise draft service.</p><p>Mary Bernuth, Co-Founder and President of Pharos Brands, stated that this development is about reshaping social rituals and building on Wisconsin's tavern culture. The launch includes strategic moves to make the beverages available nationwide, with participating taverns encouraged to share their experiences through social media channels.</p><p>Jerry Zavorka of Badger Cannabis, a subsidiary of Capitol-Husting/Allstate Liquor & Wine Company, emphasized that hemp-derived THC on tap addresses consumer shifts toward alcohol alternatives. With beer demand declining in recent years, taverns can utilize unused tap lines for THC beverages, creating additional revenue streams while offering consumers a 5mg dosage product made with all-natural ingredients.</p><p>Several Wisconsin establishments have already implemented Pharos on tap, including Orsetta in De Pere, Whitetail Inn in St. Germain, and The Phoenix Taproom & Kitchen in Eau Claire. These venues showcase Wisconsin's emergence as one of the first states to legally serve THC beverages on draft, marking a historic moment for both hospitality and cannabis industries.
