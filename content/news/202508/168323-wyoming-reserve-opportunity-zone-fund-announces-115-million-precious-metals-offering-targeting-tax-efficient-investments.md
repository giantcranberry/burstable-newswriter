<p>The Wyoming Reserve Opportunity Zone Fund Corporation announced a new offering of up to 10 million shares of common stock at $11.50 per share, targeting $115 million in total funding under Rule 506(c) of Regulation D. This follows the company's successful initial offering in March 2025, which raised approximately $26 million from accredited investors.</p><p>CEO Josh Phair cited inflation, geopolitical tensions, and economic uncertainty as drivers behind increased investor interest in precious metals. The company aims to provide an alternative asset class that potentially minimizes tax liabilities associated with physical gold and silver ownership. The core business involves generating income from purchasing and selling precious metals, along with fee-based services such as vaulting, transportation, and fulfillment for commercial and industrial clients.</p><p>The Wyoming Reserve operates from a 70,000-square-foot facility in Casper, located within a designated opportunity zone. Wyoming's status as a top sound money state and favorable tax climate—no state income tax, corporate tax, or taxes on gold and silver—enhances the investment appeal. Data from the <a href="https://www.lbma.org.uk" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">LBMA</a> indicates that gold and silver have achieved a 14.2% combined compound annual growth rate over the past five years, which the company seeks to exceed through its business model.</p><p>A key feature for investors is the "smart liquidity" repurchase policy, allowing shareholders to request repurchases of up to 1% of their shares monthly after a one-year holding period. Repurchases are taxed at long-term capital gains rates, avoiding the 28% collectibles tax on physical metals. Quarterly repurchases are also available, subject to a 5% limit on outstanding shares per quarter and regulatory compliance.</p><p>The opportunity zone location offers distinct tax advantages, including tax-free growth on gains for investments held at least 10 years. Investors can defer capital gains taxes from assets sold within the past 180 days by investing in qualified opportunity funds. Phair emphasized that these benefits, combined with the asset class and team expertise, create a compelling opportunity. The offering is available only to accredited investors, with shares subject to transfer restrictions and not listed on any securities exchange.</p>
