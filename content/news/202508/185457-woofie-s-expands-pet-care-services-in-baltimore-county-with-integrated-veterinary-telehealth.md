<p>Woofie's of North Baltimore-Owings Mills has officially launched its premier pet care services for dog, cat, and other animal owners throughout Baltimore County. The business will celebrate its grand opening with a series of community events scheduled for the week of September 7th, highlighting its mobile spa and customizable care offerings.</p><p>Operated by local residents Kelley and Rob Gludt, who bring decades of nonprofit and early-education leadership experience, the franchise emphasizes relationship-building and team management. Kelley Gludt's 20-year background as a rabbi further supports the business's community-oriented approach. The Gludt family, including their teenage son and business partner Romi, along with their Border Collie and other pets, are deeply embedded in the area they serve.</p><p>The grand opening events include participation in the Reisterstown Festival Parade on September 7th, presence at the Northwest Chamber of Commerce Farmers Market on September 10th with free nail trimming and treats from The Farmer's Dog, and involvement in Baltimore Humane Society DogFest on September 13th. At DogFest, Woofie's will offer mini grooming services, showcase its mobile spa, distribute samples, and hold a raffle for a $100 grooming gift certificate.</p><p>A key differentiator for Woofie's is its integration of 24/7 veterinary telehealth services via https://petvetconnection.com, providing pet owners with immediate access to professional advice and peace of mind. This addition complements the grooming, pet sitting, and dog walking services that define the Woofie's brand.</p><p>The North Baltimore-Owings Mills location joins existing Maryland franchises in Columbia, Annapolis, Bel Air, Bethesda, and Gaithersburg. Kelley Gludt noted that the franchise's scalable, service-oriented model and kind-hearted culture were decisive factors in their choice to invest. The business is currently expanding its team of groomers, walkers, and sitters, with applications accepted through the https://woofies.com website.</p><p>Founded in 2004 and franchising since 2018, Woofie's is the only franchise in its industry to combine mobile grooming with pet sitting and dog walking. Its focus on customizable services and customer support has led to 67 locations across 25 states. The brand is part of Authority Brands, a Columbia-based group of home service franchisors that includes 15 companies operating over 1,900 territories nationwide.</p>
