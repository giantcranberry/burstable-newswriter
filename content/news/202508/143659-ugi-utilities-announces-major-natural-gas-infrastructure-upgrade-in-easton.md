<p>UGI Utilities, Inc. has unveiled plans for a substantial infrastructure upgrade in Easton, with a natural gas main replacement project starting on August 18, 2025. This project highlights UGI's commitment to maintaining the safety and dependability of its services while modernizing the gas distribution system. It also provides an opportunity for properties along the designated routes to switch to natural gas, recognized for its cleanliness and efficiency.</p><p>The construction will concentrate on several major streets, such as South 15th Street, Northampton Street, North 7th Street, and South 12th Street. Work will occur from 7:00am to 5:00pm, Monday through Friday, potentially causing temporary disruptions like road closures, detours, and parking limitations. Intermittent natural gas service interruptions are expected, requiring UGI to access properties for inspections and equipment relighting.</p><p>Slated for completion by early December, the project's schedule may vary due to weather or other unexpected challenges. Following the main installation, final paving and restoration will take place. UGI is actively encouraging those interested in converting to natural gas to consider this opportunity during the infrastructure enhancement.
