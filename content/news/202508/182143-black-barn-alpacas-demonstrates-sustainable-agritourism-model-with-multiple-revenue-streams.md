<p>Black Barn Alpacas has emerged as Maryland's largest alpaca operation, transforming from a closed construction business into a successful agritourism destination that attracted over 20,000 visitors during its inaugural fall festival. Founders Yussy and Travis McManus transitioned to alpaca farming after recognizing the animals' sustainable qualities, including their production of hypoallergenic, antimicrobial, and thermoregulating fiber while requiring fewer resources than traditional livestock.</p><p>The farm's retail operation showcases natural fiber products transformed into sweaters, socks, gloves, hats, blankets, and other items available at https://blackbarnalpacas.com. What began as a simple farming operation quickly evolved into multiple revenue streams critical for agricultural sustainability, including educational programs that address modern challenges. Nearly 39% of teens report anxiety from social media, and half of Gen Z students feel disengaged in school, making the farm's educational tours particularly relevant.</p><p>The operation combines math, science, and sustainability into hands-on activities while providing social-emotional learning opportunities through programs like PATHSÂ® (Promoting Alternative Thinking Strategies). Seasonal events including Fall 'Ag'tivities, Easter Egg'stravaganza, and Fleece Navidad attract diverse visitors alongside summer camps, shearing demonstrations, and wellness experiences such as yoga and guided mindfulness walks.</p><p>Black Barn Alpacas has embedded itself deeply in the local community, sourcing pumpkins from young farmers, partnering with area wellness instructors, and working with local businesses. The farm is a proud member of the Carroll County Agritourism passport program, encouraging regional farm exploration. Their store features locally produced items including natural handmade bar soap and scented felted alpaca air fresheners made with fiber from their own herd.</p><p>Beyond immediate business success, the McManuses advocate for transforming American agriculture toward more sustainable, animal-friendly practices. They challenge criticisms of alpaca farming, particularly regarding shearing practices, noting that veterinarian Dr. Michelle Ing, specializing in alpaca care for 22 years, explains the medical necessity of shearing to prevent life-threatening heat stress.</p><p>The couple emphasizes that synthetic fabrics come with their own animal welfare consequences, as microplastics from synthetic textiles enter waterways and harm marine life. Alpaca farming represents one of the most sustainable forms of agriculture, requiring significantly less water, land, and energy than traditional livestock while being carbon-neutral.</p><p>The McManuses envision creating a domestic manufacturing industry for alpaca products, currently processed primarily in Peru and Bolivia. This could generate American jobs, reduce shipping emissions, and maintain high animal welfare standards. Their educational mission turns every visitor into an advocate for sustainable agriculture, demonstrating how business success, animal welfare, and environmental responsibility can work together effectively.</p>
