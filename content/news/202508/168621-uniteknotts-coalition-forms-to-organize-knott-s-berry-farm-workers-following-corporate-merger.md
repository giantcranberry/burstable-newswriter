<p>Twenty-three trade unions, in partnership with the Orange County Labor Federation, have established the UniteKnotts Coalition to organize and represent every employee at Knott's Berry Farm. This initiative emerges as the amusement park, originally a family-operated attraction, now functions under an $8 billion corporate entity following the Cedar Fair and Six Flags merger.</p><p>Frontline workers, including ride operators, food service staff, and cashiers, typically earn between $15 and $18 per hour, wages that coalition leaders argue are insufficient for meeting basic living expenses in Southern California. Chris Griswold, President of Teamsters Joint Council 42, emphasized the disparity, stating, "Knott's Berry Farm was built on community and hard workâ€”but today, it's run by a corporate giant that puts profits before people."</p><p>The coalition aims to secure fair compensation, safe working environments, and adequate staffing levels for all employees. By uniting unions that represent tens of thousands of workers across various sectors, UniteKnotts seeks to ensure comprehensive representation and advocacy. Additional details about the coalition's objectives and efforts are available at <a href="https://UniteKnotts.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://UniteKnotts.com</a>.</p><p>This organizing drive highlights broader labor movement trends in the amusement and hospitality industries, where low wages and corporate consolidation have sparked increased unionization efforts. The outcome could influence labor practices at other theme parks and large entertainment venues nationwide.</p>
