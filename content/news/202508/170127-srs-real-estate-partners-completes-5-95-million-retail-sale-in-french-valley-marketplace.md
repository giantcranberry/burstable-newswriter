<p>SRS Real Estate Partners has completed the $5.95 million sale of a newly constructed, three-tenant retail building at French Valley Marketplace in Winchester, California. The 7,226-square-foot property at 35974 Winchester Road features Panera Bread and Toro Sushi operating under long-term absolute triple-net leases, with one unit currently available for lease.</p><p>The transaction, which achieved a 5.92% cap rate, represents the latest sale in the strategic breakup of French Valley Marketplace, with only one pad remaining. SRS Capital Markets Senior Managing Principals Matthew Mousavi and Patrick Luther, along with Vice President Jack Cornell, represented the Southern California-based private developer seller. The buyer, a La Jolla-based private investor, utilized a 1031 exchange for the acquisition, and a new loan was placed on the property.</p><p>According to Mousavi, this sale marks the 11th transaction SRS has executed on behalf of the seller/developer within the center, totaling more than $55 million in value. Previous sales at the center have included major national tenants such as Grocery Outlet, EoS Fitness, Chipotle, 7-Eleven, McDonald's, and Auto Zone, demonstrating the property's appeal to established retail brands.</p><p>Cornell noted the unique structure of the deal, explaining that the Panera lease was secured before construction was fully completed. The continued demand for French Valley Marketplace reflects its prime location within the high-growth Temecula submarket, which continues to attract significant investor interest and command strong pricing. The Temecula area serves as the job center for southwest Riverside County, featuring strong industry clusters in biomedical/biotech/life science, technology, advanced manufacturing, tourism, and retail.</p><p>The region's business-friendly atmosphere, high standard of living, well-educated workforce, competitive housing prices, and strategic location between Los Angeles, San Diego, and Orange counties contribute to its attractiveness for commercial investment. The city's focus on being business-friendly in terms of costs has attracted a hub of biomedical and biotechnical advanced manufacturing companies, including Millipore Sigma, which recently expanded its operations in the area.</p><p>This transaction contributes to SRS Capital Markets' significant transaction volume, which has exceeded $1.5 billion across more than 400 transactions nationwide this year. The firm currently has over 845 properties actively on the market with a total market value surpassing $3.7 billion, positioning it as a major player in the commercial real estate sector.</p>
