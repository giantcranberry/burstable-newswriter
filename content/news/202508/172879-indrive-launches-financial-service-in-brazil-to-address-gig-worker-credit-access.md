<p>inDrive, a global mobility platform operating in 48 countries, has launched its inDrive.Money financial service in Brazil, offering digital loans specifically designed for ride-hailing drivers. The service provides quick access to cash loans of up to R$3,000 (approximately USD 548) through the inDrive app, which ranks as the world's second-most downloaded ride-hailing application.</p><p>The initiative addresses significant financial inclusion challenges faced by gig workers in Brazil, where traditional banking services often require extensive credit history that many drivers lack. According to company representatives, this gap forces many service providers to resort to informal loans with punitive interest rates, creating financial instability for those who depend on ride-hailing platforms for their livelihood.</p><p>inDrive.Money has partnered with <a href="https://emprex.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">EmpreX</a>, a Latin American fintech specializing in small business financing, to deliver the lending solution. The integration allows drivers to apply for loans directly within the inDrive app, with repayment automatically deducted from 10% to 14% of each ride's earnings over an average five-month term. This flexible repayment structure eliminates fixed daily commitments and enables drivers to manage their cash flow across multiple platforms.</p><p>Alexander Kurchin, Head of Growth at inDrive.Money, emphasized the company's mission to empower drivers with fair financial choices. The service builds on inDrive.Money's successful operations in Mexico, Colombia, and Peru, representing a proven financial tool that strengthens economic independence for service providers.</p><p>The lending solution operates through a transparent process managed by EmpreX, with regulatory compliance supported by its partnership with BMP SCD, a licensed Brazilian financial institution. Drivers can check available offers and apply for credit within the app, with EmpreX conducting full assessments based on the applicant's information and earnings history to ensure they meet required criteria.</p><p>Initial operational data shows promising results, with 86% of borrowers indicating they would take out another loan if needed and would recommend the solution to others. The service is currently available in approximately 90 Brazilian cities, including major urban centers like Manaus, Fortaleza, Salvador, Belo Horizonte, and Florianópolis, as well as mid-sized cities such as Campinas and Marabá.</p><p>Stefano Mazzaferro, Country Manager of inDrive in Brazil, highlighted the program's significance beyond mere financial inclusion. The service provides low-interest loans as a financially advantageous alternative to credit card-based solutions currently available in the market.</p><p>Silvan Roth, CEO of EmpreX, noted the transformative impact of integrating credit services directly into the ride-hailing platform. The integrated loan system provides drivers with freedom, flexibility, and the ability to maintain continuous operation without financial interruption.</p><p>The launch represents inDrive's continued commitment to combating financial injustices and expanding economic freedom for service providers in Brazil's mobility sector while contributing to the national economy through enhanced financial inclusion.</p>
