<p>Dominion Energy shares declined 2.7% on Monday as Trump administration actions targeting offshore wind projects raised concerns about the company's Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind development. The stock drop followed an administration order requiring Denmark's Ã˜rsted to halt construction on its Revolution Wind project off Rhode Island, which was scheduled to begin operations next year.</p><p>The selloff intensified late in the trading session after disclosures revealed White House plans to revoke federal approval for the $6 billion Maryland Offshore Wind project, according to a filing in federal court in Delaware. Dominion's primary exposure centers on its 2.6-gigawatt facility currently under construction off Virginia Beach, representing one of the largest offshore wind investments in the United States.</p><p>The $10.7 billion Coastal Virginia project, featuring 176 turbines designed to power 660,000 homes, remains scheduled to begin electricity production in early 2026. The company had already increased its cost estimate by 9% in March, citing higher expenses related to grid connections and onshore electrical infrastructure. Both the Virginia and Maryland projects had received clearance under the Biden administration as part of its broader renewable energy expansion agenda.</p><p>The Maryland Offshore Wind project is being developed by US Wind, a venture backed by Apollo Global Management and a unit of Italy's Toto Holding. The administration's recent policy reversals introduce fresh uncertainty for the U.S. offshore wind industry, which already faces significant cost pressures and supply-chain challenges. These regulatory shifts could have far-reaching implications for renewable energy investments and the nation's transition to cleaner power sources, potentially affecting project financing, development timelines, and investor confidence across the sector.</p>
