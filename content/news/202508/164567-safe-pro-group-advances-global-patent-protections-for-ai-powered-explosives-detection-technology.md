<p>Safe Pro Group (NASDAQ: SPAI), a frontrunner in AI-driven security solutions, has achieved a milestone in securing international patent protections for its SpotlightAI(TM) explosives detection technology. The company's recent publication notices under the Patent Cooperation Treaty in Australia, Israel, and the European region signify a pivotal advancement in its intellectual property strategy, reinforcing its dominance in the defense and humanitarian demining industries.</p><p>The efficacy of SpotlightAI(TM) is undeniable, having processed over 1.78 million drone images in Ukraine to identify more than 31,600 explosive threats. With a U.S. patent secured until 2043 and protections in 47 jurisdictions, Safe Pro is well-positioned for sustained expansion. Its inclusion in the U.S. Armyâ€™s 2026 Concept Focused Warfighter Experiment (CFWE) further attests to the technology's military utility.</p><p>The global landmine crisis underscores the urgency for innovative detection solutions. The Senate's approval of an additional $617 million in funding for small unmanned aircraft systems, encompassing Safe Pro's technology, highlights the growing demand for such advancements. This financial boost, along with the broadening of patent safeguards, is anticipated to substantially augment Safe Pro's operational capabilities and global footprint.</p><p>For further insights into Safe Pro's technological breakthroughs and their implications for worldwide security, visit <a href='https://ibn.fm/HjwrB' rel='nofollow' target='_blank'>https://ibn.fm/HjwrB</a>.
