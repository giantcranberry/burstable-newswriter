<p>Guangdong Threenh Technology Co., Ltd. (3nh), a frontrunner in the development of precision optical measurement instruments, is gearing up to unveil its state-of-the-art color measurement technologies at the Asia-Pacific Coatings Show (APCS) 2025. This significant event, taking place from September 3 to 5 at the International Trade & Exhibition Center in Bangkok, Thailand, will see ThreeNH occupying Booth 3F05. Here, the company plans to showcase its newest advancements tailored to the coatings industry's escalating requirements for precision and operational efficiency.</p><p>The coatings sector is currently placing a heightened emphasis on the precision of color control and the assurance of quality, a trend propelled by the dual demands of environmental sustainability and aesthetic excellence. ThreeNH is poised to meet these demands head-on with its extensive range of spectrophotometers, gloss meters, colorimeters, and color matching systems, all of which surpass international benchmarks. These instruments play a pivotal role in industries such as automotive paints, industrial finishes, and decorative surfaces, where slight discrepancies in color or gloss can result in substantial financial losses and product rejections.</p><p>At APCS 2025, ThreeNH will offer live demonstrations to highlight the proficiency of its instruments in capturing color in real-time, measuring gloss across diverse surface finishes, and ensuring consistency across production batches. A standout feature is the company's closed-loop color matching software, renowned for its capacity to streamline workflows and reduce waste, making it suitable for a wide array of surfaces, including those that are flat, curved, matte, or glossy.</p><p>Moreover, ThreeNH's technologies address a critical industry challenge: maintaining uniformity across various production sites and under different conditions. By providing repeatable, traceable, and precise data, these instruments significantly reduce human error and bolster reliability throughout the supply chain. This capability is particularly pertinent as the industry moves towards more sustainable practices and quicker production cycles, necessitating manufacturers to swiftly adapt without sacrificing quality.</p><p>The Asia-Pacific Coatings Show 2025 presents ThreeNH with a prime platform to connect with professionals from across the region, facilitating collaborations aimed at overcoming the industry's measurement hurdles.
