<p>Captiva Partners has completed a $26.5 million acquisition of a six-building industrial portfolio in Calabasas, California, signaling continued robust investment activity in the Los Angeles industrial real estate market. The transaction, brokered by Lee & Associates' LA North/Ventura office, involves approximately 107,000 square feet of space across 8.6 acres, comprising 47 suites ranging from 1,300 to 5,200 square feet.</p><p>The portfolio includes properties located at 23907–23947 Ventura Boulevard, 23930–23978 Craftsman Road, 5101–5111 and 5115 Douglas Fir Road, and 23961 Craftsman Road. Each building features functional layouts with rear bay loading doors and strong freeway access, positioned minutes from the US 101 Freeway for convenient access to neighboring communities.</p><p>Scott Caswell, Principal at Lee & Associates, described the property as "the largest concentration of smaller space available in the Calabasas area offering very stable tenancy and future growth opportunity." The Lee & Associates team, including Principal/Managing Director Erica Balin, represented both the seller groups—Calabasas Investment Group and Craftsman Investment Group—and the buyer in the transaction.</p><p>Brian Abers, Managing Partner of Captiva Partners, expressed enthusiasm about the acquisition, stating, "We plan to invest in strategic upgrades to the buildings and continue providing high-quality space tailored to the needs of local businesses." The purchase represents Captiva Partners' continued expansion of their industrial property portfolio across the Western United States.</p><p>The transaction underscores broader market trends in industrial real estate investment. Balin noted that the sale "speaks volumes about the current state of industrial investment—locally, regionally, and nationally. We experienced strong interest from a wide array of buyers, reflecting a clear and sustained appetite for quality small-bay, multi-tenant industrial assets." This depth and diversity of interest indicates a competitive market that remains optimistic about the future of this asset class.</p><p>The acquisition highlights the ongoing demand for well-located industrial properties in the Los Angeles area, particularly those offering smaller, flexible spaces that cater to local businesses. The strategic location and functional characteristics of the Calabasas portfolio made it particularly attractive to investors seeking stable income properties with growth potential in Southern California's competitive industrial market.</p>
