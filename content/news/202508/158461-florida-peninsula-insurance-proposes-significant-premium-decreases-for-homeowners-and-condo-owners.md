<p>Florida Peninsula Insurance Company, one of Florida's leading homeowner's insurance providers, has recently proposed a statewide average premium decrease of 8.4% for homeowners and 12% for condo owners to the Florida Office of Insurance Regulation (OIR). This proposal, if approved, is expected to offer substantial savings to a wide range of policyholders by late this year or early 2026.</p><p>The proposed rate adjustment is a direct result of the successful implementation of recent legislative reforms aimed at consumer protection. It represents the most significant rate reduction since the company's founding twenty years ago. Dulce Suarez-Resnick of Acentria Insurance noted the importance of this development, stating, "This rate decrease is one of the most substantial proposed decreases by any Florida-based insurance company," highlighting the potential benefits for thousands of Florida households.</p><p>This development comes after a challenging period characterized by inflation, rising litigation costs, and increased reinsurance expenses, which had led many insurers in Florida to hike rates in previous years. The legislative measures, including SB 2A (2022) and HB 837 (2023), have been crucial in addressing market imbalances. These reforms have successfully reduced the misuse of assignment of benefit (AOB) agreements, limited the abuse of the one-way attorney fee statute, and introduced reasonable regulations on claims handling and legal strategies.</p><p>Clint Strauch, President of Florida Peninsula Insurance, commented on the impact of these reforms, "The legislative reforms have contributed to a measurable drop in frivolous lawsuits and inflated claims, providing us the ability to pass on the savings from the law's changes to our policyholders." This rate reduction underscores the effectiveness of tackling the core issues that have contributed to rising insurance premiums in Florida.</p><p>Florida Peninsula Insurance, alongside its sister companies Edison Insurance Company and Ovation Home Insurance Exchange, remains a key player in Florida's homeowner's insurance market, dedicated to offering dependable and cost-effective coverage.
