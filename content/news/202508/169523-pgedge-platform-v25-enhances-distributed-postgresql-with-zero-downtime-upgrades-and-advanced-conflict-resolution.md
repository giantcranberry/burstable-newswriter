<p>pgEdge, Inc. has released pgEdge Platform v25, building on its industry-leading distributed PostgreSQL solution with several key enhancements that strengthen its position as an open-source alternative for multi-master database workloads. The latest iteration introduces true zero downtime capabilities for node additions and PostgreSQL version upgrades, allowing clusters to remain fully operational during these critical operations.</p><p>This feature enables rolling updates by adding new, upgraded nodes and decommissioning old ones without taking nodes offline, ensuring continuous write availability across all nodes. Platform v25 expands automatic conflict resolution to handle a broader range of scenarios commonly encountered in distributed environments. Insert-RowExists conflicts, such as two inserts with the same primary key, are now automatically converted into all-column updates, while Delete-RowMissing scenarios resolve attempted deletions of non-existent rows according to desired behavior.</p><p>Additionally, users can configure the system to check for non-null unique constraint violations and resolve them using a Last-Write-Wins approach. Performance improvements include overhauled exception handling that operates in-memory for an order-of-magnitude speed increase over previous methods and more accurate lag tracking calculated at target nodes.</p><p>The release introduces an interactive installation script that guides users through the setup process, ensuring proper configuration file creation and reducing complexity for first-time deployments. Backup and restore capabilities are enhanced through integrated <a href="https://pgbackrest.org" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">pgBackrest</a> configuration, providing a default backup method alongside a strategy guide for recommended practices.</p><p>Significant enhancements to the Active Consistency Engine (ACE) deliver faster performance, improved flexibility, and expanded automation for detecting and repairing data discrepancies across nodes, particularly in large-scale datasets. Phillip Merrick, Co-founder and CEO of pgEdge, emphasized that these features were developed in collaboration with customers and partners to improve usability while advancing distributed PostgreSQL capabilities for high availability and low latency applications.</p>
