<p>The ITS Logistics August Port Rail Ramp Index highlights growing concerns about trucker financial health across the industry as major West Coast drayage providers cease operations. Export volumes remain challenged while tariff negotiations continue, though inbound volumes to the U.S. West Coast remain strong with front-loaded goods and retail peak shipments arriving for fourth-quarter preparation.</p><p>Paul Brashier, Vice President of Global Supply Chain for ITS Logistics, noted that industry professionals should anticipate export volume surges following U.S. trade agreements with other countries as shippers work to meet pent-up demand. This expectation aligns with <a href="https://www.freightwaves.com/news" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">FreightWaves' May 2025 report</a> that the U.S.-China agreement to roll back tariffs and implement a 90-day negotiation pause would have immediate effects on global shipping markets, creating economic disruption and expected transportation rate surges.</p><p>New tariffs continue placing pressure on international trade, with the <a href="https://www.nrf.com/resources" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">National Retail Federation's Global Port Tracker report</a> confirming import cargo volume at major container ports is forecasted to end 2025 at 5.6% below 2024's volume. Preliminary data show the significant impact of current trade policies and existing tariffs on supply chains, increasing consumer prices while reducing goods availability, particularly challenging small businesses.</p><p>July retail sales excluding automobiles and gasoline increased 1.45% seasonally adjusted month-over-month and 5.89% unadjusted year-over-year as consumers increased spending in anticipation of future price hikes and potential shortages. The Port of Los Angeles handled 892,340 Twenty-Foot Equivalent Units in June 2025, marking an 8% increase from last year and making it the busiest June in the port's 117-year history.</p><p>Loaded imports reached 470,459 TEUs (10% more than 2024) while loaded exports landed at 126,144 TEUs (3% improvement from 2024), with 295,746 empty container units processed representing a 7% increase over last year. Brashier expects volumes to subside approaching September except for infrastructure and project freight, which should increase through 2025 into 2026 due to newly passed congressional legislation.</p><p>Industry professionals must pay close attention to trucking partners' financial health following recent closures of major West Coast drayage providers T.G.S. Logistics and GSC Logistics, both of which closed after nearly four decades of service citing current market conditions. These closures particularly impact the Port of Oakland supply chain community.
