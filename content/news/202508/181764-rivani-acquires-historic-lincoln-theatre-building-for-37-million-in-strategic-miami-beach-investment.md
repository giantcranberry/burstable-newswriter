<p>Robert Rivani, President of RIVANI, has acquired the historic Lincoln Theatre building at 551 Lincoln Road in Miami Beach for $37 million, a transaction that underscores significant commercial real estate momentum in the area. The property, famously anchored by <a href="https://www.hm.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">H&M</a>'s flagship Miami Beach store, spans 35,240 square feet and was secured at well below market value despite its prime location and historical designation.</p><p>The 1935 Art Deco building currently maintains 98% occupancy with premium tenants including H&M, Swatch, Chilli Beans, and Tapelia Spanish Cuisine. H&M occupies approximately 84% of the space, while Swatch recently completed a full renovation and reopened in July. The property has received nine prestigious awards, including the ULI Visionary Project of the Year Award, recognizing its architectural and commercial significance.</p><p>This acquisition follows Rivani's recent announcement that Playboy will relocate their global headquarters to the penthouse at RIVANI's flagship project at 1691 Michigan Avenue. Together, these moves signal a strategic commitment to Miami Beach's long-term development. Rivani emphasized his vision to make Lincoln Road great again, stating this is one of the most iconic properties on Lincoln Road with the potential to reignite the area as the cultural heartbeat of the city.</p><p>The transaction was brokered by <a href="https://www.jll.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">JLL</a>'s Danny Finkle and Evan Larh, occurring amid rising demand for prime retail and hospitality locations in the Lincoln Road area. Ongoing development and anticipated zoning changes are driving increased investor interest in the pedestrian promenade, which serves as a central commercial and cultural corridor for Miami Beach.</p><p>Rivani has amassed over $250 million in prime South Florida assets over recent years, with $150 million invested specifically in Miami Beach. His portfolio includes acclaimed destinations such as Amara at Paraiso, the upcoming GAIA, the fully leased Wynwood Jungle, and RIVANI's transformative 'Class X' office building. This year alone, he has completed several record-breaking deals, including the $28.2 million sale of Catch Miami Beach and a $38.25 million all-cash sale of two premier restaurant spaces.</p><p>The acquisition represents not just another property transaction but a strategic investment in the cultural and economic future of Miami Beach's most iconic thoroughfare. For business leaders and investors, this move demonstrates the continued strength of Miami's commercial real estate market and the growing appeal of historic, well-located properties with strong tenant occupancy. The transaction signals confidence in Miami Beach's long-term growth potential and may influence other investors to consider similar strategic acquisitions in culturally significant locations.</p>
