<p>HG Insights has unveiled its Revenue Growth Agentic Ecosystem, a cutting-edge AI-driven platform set to transform go-to-market (GTM) strategies in the B2B technology sector. This innovative ecosystem merges detailed market and sales intelligence with real-time agentic activation, offering a comprehensive solution for sales and RevOps leaders. The platform's launch is complemented by the strategic acquisition of MadKudu, a pioneer in agentic GTM solutions, further bolstering its capabilities.</p><p>At the core of this ecosystem is HG Insightsâ€™ Revenue Growth Intelligence (RGI) Fabric, a robust dataset encompassing firmographic, technographic, and buyer intent data. This integration facilitates the development of AI agents capable of autonomously executing GTM strategies, thereby enhancing the efficiency of connecting sellers with in-market buyers. The platform is designed to eliminate the challenges posed by data silos and fragmented tools, presenting a unified solution for strategy formulation, execution, and immediate action.</p><p>Rohini Kasturi, CEO of HG Insights, emphasizes the ecosystem's role in addressing the pressing need for GTM intelligence and agility. By amalgamating first-party data with third-party signals, the platform accelerates revenue growth. The acquisitions of MadKudu and TrustRadius have been instrumental in augmenting the platform's data sources and agentic workflows, leading to more accurate and efficient sales and marketing initiatives.</p><p>The ecosystem features several copilots, including the Market Analyzer Copilot, Sales Copilot, and RevOps AI Data Studio, each tailored to provide teams with actionable insights and AI-generated recommendations. These tools are anticipated to significantly improve the GTM process, from pinpointing market opportunities to interacting with prospective buyers.</p><p>The introduction of the Revenue Growth Agentic Ecosystem marks a pivotal shift in B2B sales and marketing, offering unmatched efficiency and effectiveness in GTM strategies. Supported by investors and powered by advanced AI technologies, HG Insights is poised to lead the evolution of revenue growth intelligence.
