Hansen previously served as Senior Director of Development and has been instrumental in driving franchise growth since joining the company in April 2021, bringing 25 years of franchising experience to her role.</p><p>Hansen has closed over 125 signed deals, strengthening Perkins and Huddle House's presence across the United States and Canada. Her notable achievements include securing the largest deal in Huddle House history—a 20-unit franchise agreement in Texas—and introducing Perkins Griddle and Go to Alberta, marking the brand's expansion into the new Canadian province.</p><p>Peter Ortiz, Chief Development Officer for Ascent Hospitality Management, emphasized Hansen's role in leading traditional and non-traditional franchise development. This advancement spotlights her contributions toward our growth and her dedication to developing exceptional brands that attract consumers and franchise partners, Ortiz said. We are incredibly proud of her accomplishments and are eager for her to explore new opportunities to expand our franchise network and strengthen our brand presence in the Family, Fast Casual, and Non-traditional dining sectors.</p><p>Prior to joining Ascent, Hansen spent two decades at REGO Restaurants, parent company of Quiznos and Taco Del Mar, where she served as Senior Director of Development and held various franchise leadership roles. Her experience also includes owning and operating a Quiznos franchise in Greenwood Village, Colorado, providing her with firsthand insight into the franchisee perspective.</p><p>Hansen highlighted the importance of her dual experience as both a franchisor and franchisee. My personal experience as a franchisee gave me a deep understanding from that perspective that I have been able to leverage for supporting entrepreneurs looking to build their legacies and be part of successful brands, she explained. Since I have joined Ascent, we have revitalized our franchising program through innovative marketing strategies, lead generation campaigns, and advanced technology systems designed to support our franchise partners in building successful and lasting businesses.</p><p>For more information about franchising opportunities, visit <a href="https://www.ascenthm.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.ascenthm.com</a>.</p>
