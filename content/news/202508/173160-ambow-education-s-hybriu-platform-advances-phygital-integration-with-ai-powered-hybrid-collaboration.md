<p>Ambow Education's HybriU platform is transforming the concept of phygital from industry buzzword to functional infrastructure through artificial intelligence integration. The platform addresses longstanding challenges in hybrid environments where remote participants often feel disconnected from in-person activities, creating unified experiences that blend physical and digital interactions seamlessly.</p><p>The system utilizes multiple cameras and AI tracking to capture rooms from various angles, ensuring remote viewers can follow movement and engagement naturally rather than watching static webcam feeds. This approach creates what the company describes as a window into the physical world, making virtual participants feel genuinely present in real-time interactions. The technology represents a significant advancement beyond traditional video conferencing platforms that have dominated the hybrid workspace since the pandemic.</p><p>HybriU incorporates augmented reality features and digital kiosk integrations that enable full participant interaction through shared workspaces and real-time overlays. The platform's capabilities allow students from different countries to collaborate on design projects using interactive whiteboards or remote teams to engage in technical workshops with AR enhancements. These features demonstrate the practical implementation of phygital interaction where digital tools enhance rather than replace human connection.</p><p>Language accessibility receives particular attention through real-time transcription and translation services that display captions in participants' preferred languages. This inclusive approach breaks down communication barriers in global educational and business settings while improving overall accessibility. The system's knowledge preservation capabilities through AI-powered recording and summarization create searchable archives of meetings and sessions, transforming transient discussions into permanent organizational assets.</p><p>While originally developed for educational environments where it enables architecture students in San Diego and Tokyo to collaborate or remote science students to follow experiments through AR technology, HybriU's applications have expanded to corporate training and hybrid conferences. Businesses are adopting the platform to upgrade from passive webinars to interactive sessions where global teams co-edit plans and brainstorm in real-time. The technology provides what Ambow describes as an omnichannel experience that rivals physical presence for remote participants.</p><p>The platform's scalability across classrooms, companies, and global teams positions it as infrastructure rather than temporary solution for modern communication needs. With ongoing development planned for expanded AR, translation, and multi-modal input capabilities, HybriU represents a practical implementation of phygital strategy that merges physical and digital environments to redefine how people connect, collaborate, and preserve knowledge across geographic boundaries.</p>
