<p>FER, the Long Island City restaurant known for authentic southwest Chinese cuisine, is expanding with a new 2,482-square-foot location inside Jackson Park at 28-10 Jackson Avenue. This marks the restaurant's third neighborhood outpost, following successful original locations on 29th Street and Crescent Street.</p><p>The expansion signals both FER's growing popularity and Long Island City's continued transformation into a major residential hub. The area's population has surged more than 75% over the past decade, creating sustained demand for new dining and retail options that cater to diverse cultural backgrounds. FER's menu, built around family recipes and hometown nostalgia, features hot and cold noodle dishes, fried rice, and handmade wontons that have developed a loyal following.</p><p>"FER was born out of our desire to serve New York City's growing communities of diverse cultural and ethnic backgrounds, connecting people with intricately made dishes," said Nigel Huang, owner and founder of FER. "Long Island City has embraced us with open arms since we opened our first location, and we look forward to introducing our comforting and delicious cuisine to even more people very soon."</p><p>Thomas Galo, EVP and Partner at RTL, represented FER in the 15-year lease negotiation. "I've now had the privilege of working with the FER team on two properties and I could not be more thrilled for their continued growth and success," Galo said. "Long Island City is a vibrant neighborhood and FER only adds to that rich community fabric."</p><p>Jackson Park, completed in 2019, comprises 1,871 apartments across three glass towers and features extensive amenities including a private park and over 120,000 square feet of indoor and outdoor facilities. The development's ground floor retail already hosts establishments like Sweetleaf Coffee Roasters, Dozo Dog, and the recently opened Serafina, positioning it as a growing commercial corridor. The new FER location sits across from Tishman Speyer's 1.2 million-square-foot creative office tower, the JACX, ensuring substantial foot traffic from both residents and office workers.</p><p>This expansion demonstrates how local businesses are growing alongside the neighborhoods they serve, particularly in rapidly developing areas like Long Island City where population growth drives demand for diverse culinary experiences and community-focused establishments. The trend highlights the importance of authentic cultural offerings in mixed-use developments that combine residential, commercial, and retail spaces.</p>
