<p>The opening of a 130,000-square-foot Lowe’s Home Improvement store at South Bridge Marketplace in Maricopa represents a pivotal moment in the area's development, showcasing the city's swift expansion and the growing need for retail and service options. Thompson Thrift, the real estate firm spearheading the project, has revealed intentions to start building a 54,000-square-foot second phase of the marketplace this year, with ALDI serving as the anchor tenant. This move is expected to further enrich the retail environment of this vibrant Arizona community.</p><p>Dan Sink, president and CFO of Thompson Thrift, highlighted the fruitful collaboration with Maricopa, noting, "Together, we’re bringing meaningful amenities and services to one of Arizona’s fastest-growing communities." This partnership not only reflects the city's business-friendly atmosphere but also its attractiveness to national retailers, establishing Maricopa as a prime location for sustained investment.</p><p>Strategically situated at the intersection of John Wayne Parkway and Honeycutt Avenue, South Bridge Marketplace benefits from its location along a busy thoroughfare, with approximately 70,000 vehicles passing by daily. With ALDI having filed for a building permit and Thompson Thrift expecting to secure permits for additional retail spaces by the fourth quarter, the marketplace is on track to broaden its tenant mix. Current occupants include Einstein Bros. Bagels, Club Pilates, Eurowax, and She Nails, with 70% of the remaining space under negotiation.</p><p>Ashlee Boyd, managing partner for Thompson Thrift Commercial, pointed to the strong demand from both national and regional retailers in Maricopa, expressing optimism about quickly leasing the rest of the space. "Our team is proud to help meet the needs of this dynamic community through thoughtful, long-term development," Boyd stated.</p><p>Thompson Thrift's dedication to Arizona's expansion is further demonstrated by its engagement in several high-profile projects across the state, including developments in Mesa, Queen Creek, Phoenix, Buckeye, San Tan Valley, Tempe, and Gilbert. With nearly four decades of experience and over $6 billion invested in local communities, Thompson Thrift remains a reliable ally in creating top-notch multifamily and commercial properties.
