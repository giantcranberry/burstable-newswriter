<p>Redwood Logistics, a fourth-party logistics provider, has expanded its collaboration with warehouse analytics company Rebus through integration with its proprietary 4PL platform, RedwoodConnect. This strategic partnership directly confronts the pervasive issue of disconnected systems in supply chain management by unifying data across multiple warehouse management systems, transportation management systems, and enterprise resource planning platforms.</p><p>The integration enables Rebus to utilize RedwoodConnect as a foundational engine for delivering cross-platform intelligence, allowing companies to harmonize real-time data from previously fragmented technological ecosystems. Ryan Uhlenkamp, Chief Executive Officer of Rebus, emphasized that combining Rebus data insights with Redwood's integration platform creates unprecedented agility for customers navigating labor constraints and operational complexity in today's challenging supply chain environment.</p><p>Eric Rempel, Chief Innovation Officer at Redwood, highlighted that many customers struggle with siloed systems that impede growth, noting that this partnership empowers shippers to integrate disconnected systems and achieve end-to-end visibility regardless of their existing technology platforms. The solution extracts and normalizes real-time data from warehouse management systems, delivering actionable insights into labor productivity and inventory accuracy while addressing persistent data gaps and visibility limitations.</p><p>A recent implementation with a $4 billion distributor managing dozens of warehouses across more than 10 different WMS platforms demonstrated the practical benefits, eliminating disconnected metrics and providing near real-time visibility and comprehensive reporting. This transformation enables faster decision-making, enhanced operational efficiency, and complete visibility across complex supply chain networks, converting fragmented data into competitive advantages particularly valuable in tight-margin operations.</p><p>The partnership significantly enhances the logistics ecosystem by enabling rapid market access through real-time data movement and connectivity within weeks, substantially minimizing time to value while optimizing revenue potential. This collaboration represents a meaningful advancement in addressing the integration challenges that have historically constrained supply chain agility and operational effectiveness, offering businesses tangible solutions to modern supply chain complexities.</p>
