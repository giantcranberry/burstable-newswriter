<p>Brera Holdings PLC has gained recognition in Italian media for the exceptional performance of its majority-owned Serie B club Juve Stabia, which achieved the highest market value increase in the league at 245% year over year. The club's valuation rose to approximately $32 million, driven by on-field success and strong social media engagement despite fielding one of Serie B's youngest squads with an average age of 24.3.</p><p>The remarkable growth provides investors exposure to the club's rising valuation through Brera's <a href="https://nnw.fm/BREA" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">NASDAQ-listed shares</a>, demonstrating the financial potential of strategic football club management. Juve Stabia, known as "The Other Team of Naples," advanced to the Serie A promotion playoffs last season under sporting director Matteo Lovisa and coach Ignazio Abate, underscoring the club's growing competitiveness within Italian football.</p><p>Brera Holdings executed an agreement to acquire a majority stake in SS Juve Stabia srl on December 31, 2024, with the acquisition of Brera's 52% majority control position concluding on June 20, 2025.
