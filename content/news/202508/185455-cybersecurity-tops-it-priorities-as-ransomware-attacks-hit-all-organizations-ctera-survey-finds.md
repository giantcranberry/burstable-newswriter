<p>Cybersecurity remains the dominant concern for IT and security leaders, with 80% identifying it as their top priority according to CTERA's 2025 State of Data and Cloud Strategy Survey Report. Cost optimization follows at 61%, while AI implementation ranks third at 57% among the 300 senior IT and security leaders surveyed from global organizations with over 2,500 employees. The comprehensive findings reveal critical challenges in balancing immediate security needs with emerging technology adoption.</p><p>The survey exposes the universal impact of ransomware attacks, with every organization reporting an incident within the past two years. Permanent data loss affected 17% of organizations, while 10% paid ransoms and 14% remained uncertain about attack resolution, indicating persistent recovery vulnerabilities despite growing security awareness. These findings underscore the ongoing threat landscape facing enterprises worldwide.</p><p>While AI ranks as the third strategic priority, deployment remains in early stages with 70% of organizations reporting partial implementation of AI-based assistants and 27% in pilot phases. The survey identifies a significant disconnect between AI ambitions and organizational readiness, with 64% of organizations facing investor pressure to implement AI for customer experience enhancement and predictive intelligence. However, only 10% are focusing on closing critical skills gaps, highlighting a major implementation challenge.</p><p>Compliance and security emerge as major hurdles for AI deployment, with 67% citing regulatory concerns as the primary challenge. Additional barriers include security risks such as data exposure or misuse (57%), data silos limiting AI access (45%), and implementation costs (44%).
