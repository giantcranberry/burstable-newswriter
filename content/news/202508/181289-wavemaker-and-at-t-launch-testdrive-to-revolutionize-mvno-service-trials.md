<p>WaveMaker, Inc. has introduced TestDrive, a white-label trial application developed in collaboration with AT&T for the MVNx ecosystem. This innovation enables mobile virtual network operators, consumer brands, and connectivity providers to offer try-before-you-buy service experiences through a fully customizable user interface that requires no coding expertise or significant technical resources.</p><p>The application allows validated consumers to provide information through minimal taps and begin service trials by activating an eSIM securely delivered to their devices. TestDrive is pre-integrated with AT&T MVNx APIs and leading digital business support system providers, enabling MVNOs to focus on branding, customer relationship management, and trial service arrangements rather than technical implementation.</p><p>Vikram Srivats, Chief Commercial Officer at WaveMaker, emphasized the strategic importance of this development for the mature U.S. MVNO market, which presents significant opportunities for existing and new players to integrate lifestyle and cultural aspects for brand-driven differentiation and growth. TestDrive serves as an ecosystem enabler for digital-first MVNOs seeking to provide branded, frictionless consumer experiences through powerful new digital channels.</p><p>William Traylor, Vice President and Head of AT&T's Emerging Business, Product and Platforms, noted that AT&T is deliberately growing a diverse ecosystem of specialists across the digital stack to tap new distribution and growth opportunities beyond their branded consumer business. The collaboration demonstrates WaveMaker's capability in delivering high-fidelity, consumer-facing mobile applications for MVNOs operating on what the company describes as America's best 5G network.</p><p>Technologically, TestDrive is built using WaveMaker's modern React Native studio and proprietary AutoCode AI/ML tooling that generates pixel-perfect user interfaces from Figma designs. The application features a built-in Hermes engine for faster load times and reduced memory usage, along with ADA compliance, encrypted communications, state management, and memoization for optimal performance across both Android and iOS platforms.</p><p>The introduction of TestDrive represents a significant advancement in how MVNOs can approach customer acquisition and service demonstration. This innovation potentially lowers barriers to entry for new market participants while enhancing the trial experience for consumers considering alternative mobile service providers, ultimately driving greater competition and innovation in the telecommunications industry.</p>
