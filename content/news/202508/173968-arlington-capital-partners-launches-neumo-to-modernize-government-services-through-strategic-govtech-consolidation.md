<p>Arlington Capital Partners has launched Neumo, a cloud-based platform designed to streamline government software and payments, by merging Avenu Insights & Analytics and Intellectual Technology Inc. with the newly acquired GovOS. The combination stitches together three established GovTech companies to deliver a unified suite spanning public administration, DMV systems, revenue compliance, justice, and integrated payments.</p><p>Neumo is led by former Avenu CEO Paul Colangelo and serves more than 4,500 public sector customers across all 50 states. The formation represents a strategic push to modernize government services through digital transformation. Colangelo emphasized that the need to modernize government represents a historic opportunity to improve citizen experiences through omnichannel, integrated software solutions.</p><p>The merger builds on Arlington's series of investments in the GovTech sector. The private equity firm acquired Avenu Insights & Analytics in October 2023, a Centreville, Virginia-based provider of revenue-management and administrative software for state and local authorities. Avenu's offerings include revenue discovery and recovery services to identify under-reported taxes, digital government solutions for online service portals, and financial systems for budgeting and payroll operations.</p><p>Earlier, Arlington had purchased Intellectual Technology in 2019, a Fort Wayne, Indiana-based DMV software and self-service hardware company offering kiosks, title and registration systems, and print-on-demand licensing solutions. The Avenu and ITI acquisitions culminated in Neumo's formation, with GovOS joining the platform after Audax's exit from GovOS via a 2023 spinout.</p><p>Arlington's ongoing capital plan supports scaling this vision, including its <a href="https://www.arlingtoncap.com/funds" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.arlingtoncap.com/funds</a> Fund VI, which closed at $3.8 billion in January 2024, representing the firm's largest fund to date. The strategic minority investment by Goldman Sachs through the Petershill program provides additional capital runway for Neumo while preserving management control.</p><p>The consolidation arrives as governments increasingly pursue digital-first agendas to improve accessibility and operational efficiency. Industry analysts note that combining three proven GovTech platforms could accelerate cross-sell opportunities and faster product modernizations for agencies at federal, state, and local levels. The move reflects broader market momentum in cloud-native government software, cybersecurity, and scalable digital services that investors are betting on to deliver durable, recurring revenue streams.</p>
