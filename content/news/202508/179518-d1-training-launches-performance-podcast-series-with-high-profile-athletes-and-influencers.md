<p>D1 Training has launched The Turf: Powered by D1, a new podcast hosted by founder and CEO Will Bartholomew featuring conversations with athletes, coaches, and influencers about training methodologies and performance excellence. The series premiered August 27 with Vanderbilt Head Football Coach Clark Lea and represents a strategic expansion of the fitness franchise's content offerings while solidifying its position in the athletic training industry.</p><p>The podcast's launch coincides with D1 Training reaching 150 open locations nationwide, positioning the company as one of the fastest-growing franchise systems in the country. Bartholomew explained that the podcast serves dual purposes: showcasing the brand's training environment and producing motivational content for audiences ranging from young athletes to seasoned professionals. Filming inside D1 facilities allows the company to demonstrate its world-class training environment while creating content that motivates listeners on their performance journeys.</p><p>The inaugural episode features a personal conversation between Bartholomew and Coach Lea, whose relationship spans decades from their high school days to their current professional connection. Lea, whose son trains at a D1 facility while Bartholomew's son plays linebacker for him at Vanderbilt, emphasized the program's broader impact on developing life lessons through athletic training. The discipline, goal setting, and deferred gratification taught through D1's methodology represent valuable skills beyond sports performance.</p><p>Upcoming episodes will feature high-profile guests including Super Bowl champion Golden Tate, Cy Young Award winner R.A. Dickey, Olympic gold medalist Shawn Johnson, and country music star Chase Rice. The diverse guest list demonstrates the podcast's appeal beyond traditional athletic audiences and aligns with D1's expansion strategy. The content is available on major platforms including <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Apple Podcasts</a>, <a href="https://spotify.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Spotify</a>, and <a href="https://youtube.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.</p><p>Bartholomew connected the podcast initiative to the company's broader franchise development goals, noting that franchise development involves building a movement beyond simply opening locations. The podcast provides another channel to spread the D1 story, celebrate athletes, and showcase the culture that distinguishes the brand. This content expansion supports D1's continued growth, with over 200 additional locations in various stages of development nationwide, reinforcing the company's position in the competitive fitness franchise market.</p>
