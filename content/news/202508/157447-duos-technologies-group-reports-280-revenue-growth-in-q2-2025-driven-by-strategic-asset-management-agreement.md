<p>Duos Technologies Group, Inc. (Nasdaq: DUOT) has unveiled its financial achievements for the second quarter of 2025, revealing a staggering 280% surge in total revenues, reaching $5.74 million. This impressive growth is primarily fueled by the company's Asset Management Agreement (AMA) with New APR Energy, which has played a critical role in enhancing its service and consulting revenue streams.</p><p>The company's financial details disclosed over $5.69 million in Services and Consulting revenue, with $4.76 million stemming from services associated with the AMA. This agreement not only signifies a substantial boost to Duos' financial health but also represents a strategic pivot towards operations with higher margins. Key operational milestones include the deployment of six gas turbine generators in Mexico and four additional units at a Hyperscaler site in Tennessee, further cementing Duos' footprint in the energy industry.</p><p>Among the quarter's operational highlights was the debut of the first production standalone Edge Data Center (EDC), alongside the commencement of installation processes at three more sites. With orders for four additional data centers, Duos is advancing towards its objective of deploying 15 EDCs by the close of 2025. The company's backlog, amounting to $40.7 million in revenue, complemented by around $18 million of contracted backlog and imminent awards, highlights the strong market demand for its offerings.</p><p>Despite the upward revenue trajectory, Duos recorded a net operating loss of $3.44 million for Q2 2025, up from the prior year's $3.22 million loss. This was largely attributed to non-cash stock-based compensation and one-time expenses linked to the AMA. Nonetheless, a notable 808% enhancement in gross margin to $1.52 million underscores the company's solid operational foundation.</p><p>Looking forward, Duos Technologies Group remains positive about its financial prospects, reaffirming its revenue projections for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2025, to be between $28 million and $30 million. This anticipated growth, a substantial leap from 2024, is driven by the company's strategic endeavors and the ongoing implementation of the AMA with New APR Energy.
