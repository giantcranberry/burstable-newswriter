<p>Whisker Labs' Ting technology, initially developed to prevent home electrical fires, has expanded into a comprehensive grid intelligence platform that now enables parametric insurance for power outages through a partnership with <a href="https://adaptiveinsurance.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Adaptive Insurance</a>. This collaboration marks the first use of real-time grid data to trigger instant insurance coverage when power fails, moving beyond traditional slow and manual claims processes.</p><p>The Ting system, deployed in over one million homes across the United States and growing at approximately 50,000 new homes monthly, leverages artificial intelligence and electromagnetic sensors to detect electrical faults both inside homes and across the utility grid. According to company data, Ting has proven effective in preventing more than 80% of home electrical fires while also identifying dangerous grid faults that can spark community-wide wildfires and outages.</p><p>Bob Marshall, Co-Founder and CEO of Whisker Labs, explained that the technology's evolution from home protection to grid-scale visibility occurred naturally as the network expanded. The system now analyzes trillions of precise measurements every second, creating what the company describes as an unprecedented view of grid behavior.</p><p>The partnership with Adaptive Insurance represents a significant advancement in how insurance companies approach power outage coverage. Instead of relying on post-event claims processing, the parametric insurance model uses Ting's hyper-local grid intelligence to detect outages in milliseconds with precision down to the neighborhood level, enabling instant, data-verified coverage for policyholders.</p><p>Beyond insurance applications, Ting's data has revealed critical insights about grid health across the United States. The system has documented wide variations in power safety, quality, and reliability that often depend on local electric utility operators. Marshall noted concerning trends regarding increased grid stress, with frequent safety problems, power quality issues, and reliability challenges likely driven by the rising demands of electrification and the growing complexity of integrating distributed solar, wind, EVs, and battery storage.</p><p>The technology has also identified specific community disparities, with some areas experiencing 10 to 30 times the frequency of surges and outages compared to averages. Notably, Ting data showed clear signs of grid stress for hours before the ignition of devastating wildfires in Maui and Los Angeles, suggesting potential for early warning systems.</p><p>Whisker Labs has expanded Ting's applications through additional partnerships, including with <a href="https://rapidsos.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">RapidSOS</a> for first responders. These integrations allow Ting's signals to help first responders act faster during electrical emergencies while enabling homeowners to proactively manage energy risk and efficiency.</p><p>Looking forward, Marshall envisions Ting Insights becoming a core pillar of grid modernization over the next decade as electrification demands increase. With the network expected to expand to tens of millions of homes, Ting aims to provide the real-time situational awareness needed to predict failures, prevent fires, validate resilience investments, and enable smarter insurance and emergency response systems.</p>
