<p>The freight and logistics industry is currently grappling with a significant uptick in identity-based fraud, as detailed in Highway's Q2 2025 Freight Fraud Index. The report highlights a 41% increase in fraudulent email attempts and a 23% rise in broker-reported identity fraud from the previous quarter, signaling a growing threat of multi-channel attacks. Michael Grace, Vice President of Customer Risk Management at Highway, points out the strategic shift in these attacks, emphasizing their coordinated nature beyond mere opportunism.</p><p>Fraudsters are increasingly exploiting identity blind spots, compromising inboxes, and impersonating legitimate carriers to divert payments and intercept rate confirmations. Highway's introduction of Secure Rate Con Delivery in May and Highway for VoIP in late 2024 represents a proactive stance against these threats, aiming to secure communications and verify user identities effectively.</p><p>The report also sheds light on a 135% increase in suspicious motor carrier ownership changes linked to cargo theft, underscoring the need for rigorous identity verification processes. Grace's advice to the industry is clear: adopting secure delivery methods, verifying contact changes, and implementing multi-factor authentication are critical steps in mitigating these risks. With half of the reported thefts occurring during Memorial Day week, the importance of vigilance and real-time identity verification cannot be overstated.</p><p>For more information on combating freight fraud, visit <a href='https://www.highway.com' rel='nofollow' target='_blank'>https://www.highway.com</a>.
