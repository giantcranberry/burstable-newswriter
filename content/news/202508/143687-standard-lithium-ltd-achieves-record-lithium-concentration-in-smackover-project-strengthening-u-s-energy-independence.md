<p>Standard Lithium Ltd. (NYSE American: SLI) has marked a significant milestone in its Smackover, Arkansas (SWA) Project, achieving a record lithium concentration of 616 mg/L from the Lester well, with an average of 582 mg/L. This achievement underscores the company's progress in securing high-grade lithium brine resources, a critical component for the burgeoning battery market. The Phase 1 fieldwork, aimed at producing 22,500 tonnes per year of battery-quality lithium carbonate, has been completed, signaling a leap forward in the company's operational capabilities.</p><p>The Arkansas Oil and Gas Commission's approval of a 2.5% royalty rate for Phase 1, a first for lithium-from-brine operations in the state, along with the unanimous approval of the Reynolds Brine Unit, reflects strong regulatory support for Standard Lithium's initiatives. The SWA Project's designation as a critical mineral production initiative under Executive Order 14241 further highlights its strategic importance to the U.S. economy and energy independence, aligning with national priorities for sustainable energy solutions.</p><p>In a strategic move to cater to the growing solid-state battery market, Standard Lithium, in collaboration with Telescope Innovations Corp., has developed a patented process to convert lithium hydroxide into battery-quality lithium sulfide. This innovation, combined with the appointment of two new vice presidents, enhances the company's strategic and operational framework, setting the stage for future growth and innovation in the lithium sector.</p><p>Financially, Standard Lithium stands on solid ground, with a strong cash position of $33.8 million and working capital of $30.6 million as of June 30, 2025, and no debt. This financial health enables the company to advance its projects without the burden of financial constraints.
