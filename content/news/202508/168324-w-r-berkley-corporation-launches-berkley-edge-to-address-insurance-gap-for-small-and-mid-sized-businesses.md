<p>W. R. Berkley Corporation has established Berkley Edge, a specialized insurance operation targeting small to mid-sized businesses with complex risk exposures. The new entity will concentrate on professional liability and casualty coverage for hard-to-place and distressed risks, operating exclusively through wholesale distribution channels.</p><p>W. Robert Berkley, Jr., president and chief executive officer of W. R. Berkley Corporation, emphasized the strategic importance of this initiative. We are deepening our commitment to the excess and surplus lines market by creating a sustainable platform tailored to small and mid-sized businesses with particularly challenging risk profiles, Berkley stated. He noted that demand for specialized insurance solutions in this segment continues to expand, positioning Berkley Edge to deliver responsive coverage with high service standards.</p><p>The corporation has appointed Jamie Secor as president of Berkley Edge, bringing 25 years of insurance industry experience to the leadership role. Secor's background includes executive positions and most recently serving as chief underwriting officer at a specialty lines property and casualty insurance company. Her extensive expertise in underwriting and developing solutions for difficult-to-insure risks aligns with Berkley Edge's mission to serve businesses that face coverage challenges in traditional markets.</p><p>Berkley Edge represents W. R. Berkley Corporation's continued expansion in the commercial insurance sector. The holding company, founded in 1967, ranks among the largest commercial lines writers in the United States and operates globally through its Insurance and Reinsurance & Monoline Excess segments. Additional information about the corporation is available at <a href="https://www.berkley.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.berkley.com</a>.</p><p>The formation of Berkley Edge addresses a significant gap in the insurance market where many small and mid-sized businesses struggle to obtain adequate coverage for their operational risks. By focusing exclusively on wholesale broker distribution, the new operation aims to provide specialized underwriting capabilities and tailored solutions for businesses that conventional insurers often decline or severely restrict.</p>
