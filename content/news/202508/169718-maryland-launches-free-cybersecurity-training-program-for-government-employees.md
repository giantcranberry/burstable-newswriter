<p>The Maryland Department of Labor has launched a comprehensive cybersecurity training initiative for state and local government employees through its Employment Advancement Right Now grant funding. The Cybersecurity Operational Methods and Education Training (COMET) program, delivered by <a href="https://bcrcyber.com/comet" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">BCR Cyber</a>, addresses the urgent need for skilled cybersecurity professionals in public sector organizations confronting increasingly sophisticated digital threats.</p><p>The program features two specialized tracks designed for different experience levels within the government workforce. The Incumbent Training track provides a 5-week foundation course covering Security Operations Fundamentals, Cyber Range Simulation, and Fundamentals of Artificial Intelligence in Security Operations Centers. This track requires participants to have at least one year of IT or cybersecurity experience and manager approval for training during business hours.</p><p>The Advanced Incumbent Training offers intensive 5-week instruction focusing on network devices, security appliances, threat basics, applications, and networks. This advanced program culminates in a CompTIA Security+ certification test voucher, providing government employees with industry-recognized credentials at no cost. Participants must possess at least two years of relevant experience to qualify for this track.</p><p>This initiative arrives during a period of heightened cybersecurity threats targeting government infrastructure nationwide. Maryland's investment in upskilling existing employees represents a strategic workforce development approach that circumvents the lengthy recruitment processes typically associated with hiring external cybersecurity talent. The program's cohort structure, with live instruction sessions scheduled from September 29 through November 3, provides structured learning while accommodating government work schedules.</p><p>The training addresses critical cybersecurity challenges facing government agencies, including ransomware attacks, data breaches, and sophisticated phishing campaigns targeting public servants. By enhancing the skills of current employees, Maryland aims to strengthen its defensive capabilities without disrupting existing operations or requiring extensive new hiring. The inclusion of AI and machine learning components in the curriculum reflects the evolving nature of cybersecurity threats and the increasing role of automated systems in both attack and defense scenarios.</p><p>Government employees completing this training will be better equipped to understand and respond to modern cyber threats that increasingly incorporate artificial intelligence techniques. The program represents a proactive measure to build internal cybersecurity expertise while maintaining operational continuity within government agencies.</p>
