<p>Upstage has raised $45 million in a Series B bridge round with backing from Korea Development Bank, Amazon, and AMD, bringing its total funding to $157 million. The investment will accelerate development of the company's next-generation Solar language model, advance document AI products, and support expansion into U.S. and APAC markets.</p><p>The funding addresses critical inefficiencies in document-intensive industries, particularly insurance where claims adjudication costs reach $25.7 billion annually. Industry analysis indicates $18 billion of these costs stem from overturned denials and unnecessary review cycles caused by manual, paper-heavy operations and outdated systems. Upstage is targeting insurance as its first major global vertical, focusing on automating resource-heavy areas like claims processing and broker submissions.</p><p>At the core of Upstage's solution is its Document Intelligence suite, which incorporates Document Parse for transforming unstructured documents into structured, LLM-ready formats and Information Extract for pulling key data points from raw text. The platform processes high-variation document packets including policies, loss runs, financial statements, invoices, and emails with over 95% accuracy, eliminating manual data entry and reducing processing time.</p><p>Unlike traditional OCR tools that extract static fields without understanding context, Upstage's technology interprets documents holistically, understanding layout, meaning, and purpose to deliver structured outputs ready for real-world workflows. The company's Solar LLM, a family of proprietary small language models trained with Amazon SageMaker, underpins this broader generative AI stack and is available through https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace.</p><p>The funding follows Upstage's strategic collaboration with Amazon Web Services as its preferred cloud provider. Under this partnership, Upstage utilizes AWS's machine learning infrastructure including SageMaker and AWS-designed silicon including Trainium and Inferentia for building and deploying foundation models. The company also offers its Universal Information Extractor through the https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/ai-agents-tools.</p><p>Upstage's models are already deployed by Fortune 500 companies including Samsung and are widely used by Korean insurance companies, demonstrating the company's ability to move from concept to production. The recent CB Insights AI 100 recognition further validates Upstage's traction in global markets. This bridge round builds on the company's $72 million Series B announced in 2024, led by Korean investors including SK Networks and Shinhan Venture Investment.</p><p>The implications of this funding extend beyond Upstage's growth, representing a significant step toward addressing systemic inefficiencies in document-intensive industries through AI-powered automation that delivers both cost reduction and operational excellence.</p>
