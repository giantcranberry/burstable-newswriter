<p>Hestia Insight Inc. has unveiled Pat-Agent, an AI-driven patent service that promises to transform the patent filing landscape for small and medium enterprises (SMEs). By potentially slashing costs by up to 80% and significantly accelerating the filing process, Pat-Agent aims to make patent protection more accessible to over 234,000 SMEs each year. This development is particularly timely, as the legal AI market is on track to reach $10.8 billion by 2030, underscoring the growing demand for cost-effective and efficient patent solutions.</p><p>The effectiveness of Pat-Agent was first proven by Hestia Insight itself, which used the service to file its own patents. The company reported an 80% reduction in costs and a dramatic decrease in processing time from two months to just ten days. Early adopters of Pat-Agent have echoed these successes, with one user leveraging the service to broaden their patent claims and strengthen their intellectual property defenses. Edward Boyle, Chief Strategy Officer at Hestia Insight and the mind behind Pat-Agent, was motivated by the outdated and expensive nature of traditional patent filing processes, which pose significant challenges for SMEs.</p><p>What sets Pat-Agent apart is its AI-powered patent intelligence capability, which can analyze thousands of related patents within minutes and provide users with detailed graphical maps of the patent landscape. Additionally, the service offers objective scoring based on USPTO patentability criteria and predicts the likelihood of examiner acceptance, making it an indispensable tool for SMEs looking to safeguard their innovations. Pat-Agent also tackles the issue of high patent rejection rates by facilitating rapid amendments to filings, a process that traditionally takes months, now achievable in days and at a much lower cost.</p><p>For further details on Hestia Insight Inc. and its regulatory filings, visit <a href='http://www.sec.gov' rel='nofollow' target='_blank'>http://www.sec.gov</a>. Pat-Agent is poised to redefine the patent filing process for SMEs, offering a more accessible and affordable pathway to protecting innovations, and signifies a major milestone in the convergence of AI and legal services.</p>
