Ryan Tomkins, Vice President at SRS Capital Markets, who represented the seller, a Denver-based private developer, emphasized the strategic location of the property within the Baseline community, near the new Center St development, as a key factor in its long-term value proposition. The buyer, a Kansas City-based private investor, engaged in a 1031 exchange, further illustrating the property's investment appeal.</p><p>KinderCare, the nation's largest private provider of child care with more than 2,400 locations across 40 states, continues to expand its footprint in high-growth areas like Broomfield.
