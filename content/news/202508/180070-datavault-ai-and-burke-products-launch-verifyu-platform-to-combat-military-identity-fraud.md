<p>Datavault AI Inc. (Nasdaq: DVLT) has partnered with Burke Products to launch the VerifyU platform, a patented solution designed to combat stolen valor and identity fraud within the U.S. military. The platform employs AI and blockchain technology to provide real-time authentication of identities, service records, and credentials, aiming to restore integrity to military valor awards and prevent fraudulent claims.</p><p>The global identity verification market is projected to exceed $50 billion by 2030, driven by increasing demand for regulatory compliance and fraud prevention. VerifyU leverages Datavault AI's patented DataScore algorithms and blockchain technology to mint experiential Valor tokens, connecting service members to benefits, discounts, and promotions offered by private sector businesses. This initiative addresses the significant economic impact of stolen valor, which the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs estimates has resulted in over $100 million in improper payments related to misrepresented service in recent years.</p><p>Roger Stone, a political consultant who has advised U.S. presidents on national security and veteran affairs, emphasized the importance of this technology, stating that it aligns with the intent of the Stolen Valor Act and could prevent errors like those that damaged the congressional candidacy of Air Force veteran RJ Majewski. Similarly, Frank Mir, a two-time UFC Heavyweight Champion and senior adviser, called VerifyU a bipartisan cause that should be supported by legislation to standardize military records.</p><p>Stolen valor not only drains resources from legitimate veterans but also erodes public trust and poses security risks. Fraudulent claims have diverted hiring quotas under the Veterans Preference Act, denying jobs to real veterans and costing economies globally up to 1% of GDP in affected sectors. VerifyU's technology, including patents like <a href="https://www.uspto.gov/patents/search" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">U.S. Patent No. 11,195,362</a> for secure data authentication, offers a proactive approach to verification, shifting from reactive fraud detection.</p><p>Nathaniel Bradley, CEO of Datavault AI, highlighted the platform's scalability and compliance with federal frameworks, noting its potential to redefine credentialing and valor awards handling. Aaron Bahkshi, CEO of Burke Products, emphasized the investor opportunity in this fast-growing sector, while Christopher Neiweem, an Iraq War veteran and founder of Arsenal Government and Public Affairs Group, advocated for bipartisan support to prevent stolen valor and maintain integrity in workforce decisions.</p><p>Datavault AI will host a live demonstration of VerifyU on November 10, 2025, in Washington, D.C., showcasing its capabilities to authenticate military records and combat identity fraud.
