<p>Vivakor, Inc. has rescheduled the record date for its special dividend of Adapti Inc. shares from August 20 to September 5, 2025, affecting shareholder eligibility for the distribution. The dividend consists of Vivakor's approximately 206,595 shares in Adapti, representing a 13.5% stake in the company. Each Vivakor shareholder will receive about 0.0079 Adapti shares per Vivakor share held, based on Vivakor's roughly 47.3 million outstanding shares, excluding those waived by insiders.</p><p>At Adapti's current share price of $2.50, the total value of the dividend amounts to approximately $0.515 million. This timing adjustment provides Vivakor with flexibility to align the distribution with evolving corporate strategies and market conditions. The energy sector company, which focuses on transportation, storage, reuse, and remediation services, views this dividend as part of its comprehensive asset management approach.</p><p>The delayed record date gains significance in light of Adapti's recent acquisition of The Ballengee Group, a Dallas-based sports management agency representing approximately 200 professional athletes. This strategic move diversifies Adapti's business interests into the sports management industry, potentially influencing its future growth trajectory and market valuation. Shareholders now have additional time to assess how this acquisition might impact Adapti's performance and, consequently, the value of their dividend shares.</p><p>For further details, investors can refer to the full press release available at <a href="https://ibn.fm/IQGky" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://ibn.fm/IQGky</a>. Additional news and updates related to Vivakor are accessible in the company's newsroom at <a href="https://ibn.fm/VIVK" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://ibn.fm/VIVK</a>. The record date reset underscores the critical role of timing in corporate actions and demonstrates Vivakor's ongoing commitment to strategic investment management.</p><p>This development highlights how corporate timing decisions can significantly impact shareholder value and market perception. The extended timeline allows for better assessment of Adapti's new sports management venture, potentially affecting how shareholders value their upcoming dividend. For business leaders and investors, this case illustrates the importance of strategic timing in corporate distributions and the need to consider subsidiary company developments when evaluating dividend decisions.</p>
