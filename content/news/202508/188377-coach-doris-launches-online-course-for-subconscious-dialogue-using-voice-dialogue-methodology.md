<p>Coach Doris has announced the upcoming launch of Conversations with Your Subconscious Mind, a six-session live online course designed to help participants establish meaningful communication with their inner selves through Voice Dialogue methodology. The course, scheduled to begin in late September 2025, represents a significant development in accessible mental wellness tools that focus on listening rather than fixing internal conflicts.</p><p>The program addresses the growing need for approaches that move beyond traditional self-improvement methods. Many individuals experience inner conflict, hesitation, or unexplained feelings that traditional approaches often attempt to suppress or fix rather than understand. This course offers an alternative framework rooted in compassion, self-awareness, and soul connection, providing participants with practical tools to identify unconscious energies and inner voices that shape their thoughts and choices.</p><p>Each live Zoom session will explore specific aspects of inner dialogue through guided methods and experiential practices. Participants will receive downloadable step-by-step guides and six-month access to session recordings, ensuring continued growth beyond the course duration. The program also includes optional private Voice Dialogue sessions with Coach Doris for personalized feedback and deeper integration of the practices.</p><p>The course incorporates a simplified version of Carl Jung's Active Imagination technique, reimagined for everyday use. This adaptation makes profound psychological concepts accessible to those without formal training in psychology or therapy. The approach is particularly relevant for individuals navigating life transitions, experiencing burnout, or seeking deeper self-understanding during periods of personal growth.</p><p>Early registration is available through the <a href="https://www.coachdoris.com/course-waitlist" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">course waitlist</a>, which provides priority updates and exclusive pre-enrollment benefits. The program is designed as a complement to existing therapeutic or coaching relationships rather than a replacement for professional mental health care.</p><p>Coach Doris brings decades of experience from her background in human resources and specialized training in Voice Dialogue methodology. The course represents a shift toward approaches that emphasize listening to inner wisdom rather than attempting to fix perceived flaws, offering participants what Coach Doris describes as an inner compass for navigating life's challenges with greater clarity and self-awareness.</p>
