<p>Royalty Management Holding Corporation (Nasdaq: RMCO) has expressed support for the recently announced partnership between ReElement Technologies Corporation and Vulcan Elements, which aims to establish one of the first cost-focused rare earth magnet supply chains in the United States. The company, through its portfolio investments and royalty holdings, is positioned to supply both mined and recycled rare earth mineral feedstock to ReElement Technologies as it expands its refining and separation processes.</p><p>Thomas Sauve, Chief Executive Officer of Royalty Management, emphasized the significance of this collaboration between ReElement Technologies, which specializes in refining and processing, and Vulcan Elements, which will utilize the refined products for rare earth magnet manufacturing. Over recent years, Royalty Management has actively pursued opportunities in the rare earth element industry, securing various feedstock sources including rare earth mines, NeoRe, SpA, and mined coal sources in eastern Kentucky. This effort builds on an existing agreement with ReElement to provide raw materials for refining operations.</p><p>Sauve noted that while Advanced Magnet Lab in Melbourne, Florida, recently manufactured the first magnet in the United States using proprietary technology—a development Royalty Management also supports—the ReElement and Vulcan partnership underscores the critical need to expand domestic magnet manufacturing capabilities. Royalty Management is engaged in active discussions with ReElement Technologies to supply additional feedstock for their oxide refining and separation operations, leveraging existing sources to facilitate this partnership.</p><p>Through its diverse portfolio of companies and royalties, Royalty Management can assist ReElement Technologies by providing source feedstock that will be refined for use by Vulcan Elements. The company is also seeking further investments and expansion within the rare earth feedstock sector to bolster the domestic supply chain.
