Spot gold prices rose by 0.1%, reaching $3,347.34 per ounce, a development that underscores the metal's role as a safe haven during times of economic uncertainty.</p><p>This uptick in gold prices is not only a reflection of investor sentiment but also highlights the broader economic indicators that influence commodity markets. The assurance that no tariffs will be imposed on bullion further supports market stability, benefiting companies within the gold sector, such as <a href='https://www.gemxx.com' rel='nofollow' target='_blank'>GEMXX Corp.
