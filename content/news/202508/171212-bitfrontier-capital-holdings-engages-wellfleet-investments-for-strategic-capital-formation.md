<p>BitFrontier Capital Holdings, Inc., operating as EVERMIND Holdings, Inc., has engaged Wellfleet Investments LLC to lead its capital formation strategy. The veteran investment banking firm, established in New York in 1998, will support the company's efforts to raise capital through a structured two-phase approach. Wellfleet Investments LLC is a registered broker-dealer with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and maintains membership with <a href="https://www.finra.org" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">FINRA</a> and SIPC, specializing in structuring and placing financings for both private and public companies.</p><p>The capital strategy will unfold in two distinct phases, with Phase I involving a seed raise of $150,000 to fund critical foundational work. These proceeds will support legal and compliance review, modernization of the company's Charter and Bylaws, governance enhancements, and the formation of EVERMIND Labs. The funds will also facilitate the finalization of the acquisition of ERApeutics, doing business as EVERMINDâ„¢ Beverage, along with PCAOB audit preparation, OTCQB uplisting readiness, and expanded investor relations efforts.</p><p>Phase II will involve a larger institutional raise ranging from $1.5 million to $2 million, contingent upon successful completion of Phase I and advancement to OTCQB status. These funds will be used to acquire additional accretive assets, transition them into value-producing operations, and further scale the company's platform. The engagement of a FINRA-registered investment banker validates the company's methodical approach to creating shareholder value through disciplined turnaround execution.</p><p>Dr. Jordan P. Balencic, CEO of BFCH, emphasized the significance of securing a registered investment banker at this stage, while Jeffrey Bega, CEO and Managing Partner of Wellfleet Investments, noted that BFCH's governance reset, audit readiness, and asset strategy align with what smart capital seeks in early-stage structured turnarounds. Additional information about Wellfleet can be found through <a href="https://brokercheck.finra.org" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">FINRA BrokerCheck</a> and the firm's website at <a href="https://www.wellfleetinvestments.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.wellfleetinvestments.com</a>.</p><p>Concurrently with these developments, BFCH has amended its Q2 report and 2024 management certification on OTC Markets to ensure filings accurately reflect current management, capitalization, and strategic direction. The company continues to execute its repositioning toward cognitive health, functional wellness, and performance-driven innovation through governance reform and compliance-focused capital formation, signaling a structured approach to corporate transformation that could serve as a model for other early-stage companies seeking institutional funding.</p>
