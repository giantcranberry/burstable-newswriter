<p>Everflow has unveiled Traffic Health, a cutting-edge tool designed to monitor domain health and IP blacklists, aiming to mitigate security threats that adversely affect affiliate marketing performance. Integrated with Google Threat Intelligence, Traffic Health equips businesses with the means to swiftly identify and rectify domain security vulnerabilities, ensuring the integrity and optimization of traffic.</p><p>Sam Darawish, CEO and Co-Founder of Everflow, underscored the importance of Traffic Health in safeguarding both revenue and reputation through early threat detection and rapid response mechanisms. The tool boasts comprehensive features such as ad-blocker list detection, SSL monitoring, and real-time alerts, all accessible via an intuitive dashboard on the Everflow platform.</p><p>The inception of Traffic Health was driven by the urgent need to tackle prevalent issues like traffic loss, diminished revenue, and eroded partner confidence. For example, the tool could have averted scenarios where a customer experienced a 10-day disruption in mobile traffic due to a domain block by Verizon USA, or where an advertiser faced extended delays in resolving ad blocker-related complications.</p><p>Arshi Bhasin, Product Manager at Everflow, pointed out the tool's role in providing a unified platform for overseeing domains, SSL certificates, and IPs, thereby enabling proactive measures to forestall potential problems. Traffic Health is a key component of Everflow's overarching strategy to bolster transparency, automation, and loss prevention within the affiliate marketing sector, complementing other innovations like Everflow Pay and Flowchart Visualization.</p>
