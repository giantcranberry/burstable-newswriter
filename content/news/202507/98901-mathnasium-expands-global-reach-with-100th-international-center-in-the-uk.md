<p>Mathnasium Learning Centers has achieved a notable milestone by opening its 100th international center in Hammersmith, United Kingdom, establishing the UK as its largest market outside the U.S. with 37 centers. This expansion underscores the increasing global demand for supplemental math education, fueled by learning gaps from the pandemic, the growth in STEM careers, and a greater recognition of math's role in future success.</p><p>Tyler Sgro, CEO of Mathnasium, highlighted the franchise's dedication to delivering effective math education that enhances children's confidence and comprehension. The Hammersmith center, operated by franchisee Dan Tregoning, is set to cater to around 20,000 students from 30 schools, with programs aimed at cultivating a deep and enduring appreciation for mathematics.</p><p>The UK's emergence as Mathnasium's largest international market outside North America reflects the franchise's effective model and its accolade as the 2024 Franchise of the Year by the British Franchise Association. With ambitions to expand into Romania, Saudi Arabia, and Australia, Mathnasium is poised to extend its global footprint, meeting the urgent need for high-quality math education across the globe.</p><p>Opened in May 2025, the Hammersmith center is a key part of Mathnasium's mission to equip students with the mathematical skills and self-assurance necessary for academic and personal achievements.
