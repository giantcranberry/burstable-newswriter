<p>Emperor Metals Inc. (CSE: AUOZ) (OTCQB: EMAUF) (FRA:9NH) has recently announced a remarkable 104% increase in the estimated gold resources at its Duquesne West Gold Project located in Quebec. This announcement is based on the initial Mineral Resource Estimate (MRE), which now reports an Inferred Mineral Resource of 26.9 million tonnes grading 1.69 g/t gold, amounting to a total of 1.460 million ounces. This significant update not only marks a pivotal achievement for Emperor Metals Inc. but also underscores the Duquesne West Gold Project's escalating potential and the efficacy of the company's exploration methodologies.</p><p>The detailed breakdown of the resource reveals that about 44% is conducive to open-pit extraction, with the remaining 56% being suitable for underground mining. The presence of high-grade intercepts, such as 22.7 meters at 35.2 g/t gold, further accentuates the deposit's quality. In light of these findings, Emperor Metals Inc. has outlined a summer drill campaign spanning 8,000 to 10,000 meters aimed at further expanding the resource. The company's ambitious goal is to surpass two million ounces by 2025, a target that seems increasingly attainable given the current trajectory.</p><p>CEO John Florek emphasized the discovery cost of $7 per ounce as a clear indicator of the company's capital efficiency, a particularly noteworthy achievement in the current climate of robust gold prices. This development not only reflects Emperor Metals Inc.'s advancements in exploration but also solidifies the Duquesne West Gold Project's status as a key asset within the gold mining sector of the Canadian Shield.
