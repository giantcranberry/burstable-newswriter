<p>Royalty Management Holding Corporation (Nasdaq: RMCO) has announced a comprehensive Bitcoin Treasury Management Strategy, signaling a significant shift in its approach to capital preservation and growth. This strategy involves the systematic investment of excess cash into Bitcoin and other digital assets, which the company views as long-term reserve assets. The initiative is based on the belief that Bitcoin can act as a hedge against inflation and currency debasement, aligning with sound monetary principles in today's uncertain economic environment.</p><p>In addition to its treasury strategy, Royalty Management is enhancing its infrastructure to support Bitcoin mining and high-performance compute (HPC) data centers. This development leverages the increasing overlap between decentralized finance and AI workloads. The company has already secured land and infrastructure in Kentucky, West Virginia, and Indiana, suitable for these operations. It is working with a national industrial site consultant to finalize competitive power pricing and to market its first package to operators.</p><p>Thomas Sauve, CEO of Royalty Management, underscored the company's dedication to Bitcoin as a fundamental digital asset with lasting value. The strategy introduces innovative royalty structures, including the option for partial compensation in Bitcoin. This approach aims to align cash flow with the performance of on-site mined BTC and to encourage long-term network growth.</p><p>With access to more than $50 million in registered securities, Royalty Management is in a strong position to opportunistically expand its Bitcoin and other digital asset holdings. The company's collaboration with a nationally recognized consultant for its eastern Kentucky site represents a crucial step towards launching its Bitcoin mining and datacenter leasing program, with plans to extend this model to additional locations.</p><p>Ben Kincaid, a Board Director at Royalty Management, pointed out Bitcoin's potential to contribute to America's economic revival, focusing on industrial development, energy innovation, and financial resilience. The company's strategic move towards Bitcoin and digital infrastructure highlights its investment in the future of American economic strength and competitiveness.</p><p>The implementation of the Bitcoin treasury program is subject to final Board approval and current market conditions, with the flexibility to modify allocations as necessary. This adaptable approach demonstrates Royalty Management's commitment to utilizing digital assets and high-performance computing for sustainable growth.</p>
