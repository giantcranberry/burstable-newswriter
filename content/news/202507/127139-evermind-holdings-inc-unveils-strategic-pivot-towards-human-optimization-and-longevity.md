<p>BitFrontier Capital Holdings, Inc. (OTC: BFCH), now transitioning to EVERMIND Holdings, Inc., has announced a strategic pivot towards human optimization, cognitive performance, and longevity infrastructure. This move, spearheaded by new CEO Dr. Jordan P. Balencic, aims to reposition the company in the rapidly growing wellness and performance enhancement sectors. The announcement comes with a detailed business plan that outlines the company's vision to become a multi-division platform, leveraging opportunities in these emerging markets.</p><p>Under Dr. Balencic's leadership, EVERMIND Holdings has already made significant strides in restructuring, including retiring over $2 million in legacy convertible debt and reducing total liabilities to under $94,000. These efforts are part of a broader strategy to strengthen the company's financial health and restore investor confidence. A notable aspect of the plan is the introduction of a fixed-price equity conversion at $0.01 per share, designed to eliminate variable-rate dilution from legacy obligations and set a clear path for future growth.</p><p>The EVERMIND Holdings platform is structured into three divisions: EVERMIND Labs, EVERMIND Technologies, and EVERMIND Manufacturing. Each division focuses on scalable opportunities in consumer-facing wellness brands, technology at the intersection of brain performance and digital health, and domestic co-manufacturing infrastructure, respectively. This diversified approach is intended to drive revenue, encourage innovation, and enhance supply chain resilience.</p><p>To support its ambitious objectives, EVERMIND Holdings is preparing a $150,000 seed round to fund immediate goals such as rebranding, regulatory filings, and the development of corporate communications strategies. The company is also considering a potential Regulation A offering later in 2025, depending on share price and regulatory qualifications. While no definitive acquisition agreements have been finalized, preliminary discussions regarding potential transactions are underway.</p><p>Investors and stakeholders interested in the detailed business plan can access it on the company's website at <a href='https://evermindholdings.com' rel='nofollow' target='_blank'>https://evermindholdings.com</a>, which also serves as a key channel for corporate communications. This strategic overhaul under new leadership signifies a pivotal step towards EVERMIND Holdings' vision of leading the human optimization and longevity sectors.</p>
