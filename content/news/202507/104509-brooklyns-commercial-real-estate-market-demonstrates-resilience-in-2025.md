<p>Brooklyn's commercial real estate market has demonstrated notable resilience in the first half of 2025, with investment sales reaching $3.25 billion across 453 transactions. This data, sourced from Ariel Property Advisors' Brooklyn 2025 Mid-Year Commercial Real Estate Trends report, indicates a modest 4% increase in transaction volume and a slight 2% decline in dollar volume compared to the same period in 2024. Sean R. Kelly, Esq., a partner at Ariel Property Advisors, emphasized the market's robustness in the face of macroeconomic challenges, pointing to development land values hitting an unprecedented high of $313 per buildable square foot (BSF). This peak is largely credited to pro-housing initiatives like City of Yes, showcasing strong confidence in Brooklyn's sustained growth.</p><p>The multifamily sector stood out as a particularly strong performer, with transaction volume rising by 10% and dollar volume increasing by 14% to surpass $2 billion. A noticeable trend among investors is the focus on smaller, free-market buildings to circumvent rent regulations, a tactic exemplified by the $127.5 million sale of 395 Leonard Street. Meanwhile, development dollar volume experienced a 5% year-over-year growth to $610 million, with Williamsburg at the forefront of sales within the borough. Contrastingly, the industrial sector faced a downturn, with a 21% reduction in transactions and a 51% fall in dollar volume. On the other hand, the retail sector enjoyed a 16% uptick in dollar volume, fueled by institutional investments in key locations.</p><p>Ariel Property Advisors' findings highlight the vibrant and varied performance of Brooklyn's real estate market across different sectors, underscoring its overall resilience amidst economic uncertainties. This resilience, coupled with strategic investments and policy support, paints a promising picture for Brooklyn's commercial real estate landscape moving forward.</p>
