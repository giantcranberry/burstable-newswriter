Available in keyed and dummy functions, the handleset is suited for single or double front doors, offering Matte Black and Satin Nickel finishes. Both options are equipped with Microban antimicrobial protection, ensuring a higher level of cleanliness by inhibiting the growth of bacteria on the surface.</p><p>At the heart of the Brentford handleset's appeal is Kwikset's SmartKey Security technology, which provides robust resistance against common burglary techniques such as bumping and picking. This feature, coupled with the convenience of homeowner re-keying, positions the Brentford as a standout option for those prioritizing security without sacrificing ease of use. The handleset has been awarded a Grade AAA certification by the Builders Hardware Manufacturers Association, a testament to its superior security, durability, and finish quality.</p><p>Amanda Archer, group manager of product marketing at Kwikset, emphasized the Brentford's design philosophy, which marries adaptability with aesthetic appeal and functional security.
