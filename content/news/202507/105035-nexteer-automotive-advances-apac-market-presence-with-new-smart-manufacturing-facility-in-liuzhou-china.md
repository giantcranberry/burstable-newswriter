<p>Nexteer Automotive has initiated the construction of a state-of-the-art smart manufacturing facility in Liuzhou, China, a move that significantly bolsters its position in the Asia-Pacific (APAC) steering market. This development is a direct response to the escalating demand from original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) worldwide for sophisticated steering and motion control technologies, such as Column-Assist Electric Power Steering systems and Modular Power Packs.</p><p>Encompassing more than 40,000 square meters, the facility is slated to become operational by the first half of 2026. It will house advanced laboratories, test tracks, and an employee center, marking a substantial upgrade from Nexteer's existing operations in Liuzhou. The expansion is not just about scaling up production but also about enhancing the in-house manufacturing of critical components and strengthening supply chain partnerships. A notable feature of this project is the inclusion of a co-location space for key suppliers, aimed at fostering immediate innovation and achieving cost efficiencies.</p><p>Jun Li, Nexteer's Global Vice President and APAC Division President, pointed out the facility's strategic importance in meeting the surging demand for steering solutions in China and the wider APAC region. The design of the facility incorporates principles of smart and green manufacturing, reflecting both local sustainability goals and Nexteer's dedication to responsible innovation.</p><p>Robin Milavec, President, Chief Technology Officer, Chief Strategy Officer, and Executive Board Director of Nexteer Automotive, reiterated the company's approach of global thinking coupled with local action to sustain its leadership in China's fiercely competitive automotive sector. The Liuzhou facility is expected to complement the APAC Technical Center in Suzhou, China, playing a crucial role in Nexteer's global manufacturing strategy.</p>
