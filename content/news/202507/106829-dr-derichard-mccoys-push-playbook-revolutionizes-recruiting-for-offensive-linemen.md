<p>The P.U.S.H. Playbook by Dr. Derichard McCoy is setting a new standard for recruiting success among offensive linemen, a group historically overlooked in the college football recruiting process. The book's P.U.S.H. Framework—Playing Time, Up-Leveling, School, and Hype—provides a strategic blueprint for athletes to navigate the complexities of securing scholarships. Dr. McCoy's personal ascent from a high school student with a 1.4 GPA to a doctoral degree holder and assistant professor at Benedict College exemplifies the transformative potential of his approach.</p><p>Further amplifying its impact, Dr. McCoy's Football I-Q platform is spearheading a research initiative at Benedict College. This project aims to harness advanced scouting techniques and AI applications to elevate the college's football program to compete with elite FBS Power 4 schools. Such innovations are poised to redefine athlete development and recruiting, especially at Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), where resources for such advancements have traditionally been limited.</p><p>The resonance of The P.U.S.H. Playbook and the Football I-Q initiative is already evident across the Southeast, with stakeholders in the athletic community praising its potential to level the playing field for under-represented student-athletes.
