<p>TruckIT, a forefront technology provider in the bulk hauling supply chain, has entered into a strategic partnership with Bolton Capital, a financial services firm with a focus on the dump truck hauling sector. This alliance is designed to tackle the pervasive cash flow challenges within the industry by enabling haulers to receive payments more swiftly, thereby facilitating operational expansion. The integration of Bolton Capital's expedited payment solutions into TruckIT's digital platform promises a streamlined process from the completion of jobs to the receipt of payments, cutting down the conventional 60â€“70 days accounts receivable period dramatically.</p><p>Accession Distribution, a hauling company located in Riverdale, GA, serves as an early beneficiary of this partnership, with reports of payments being processed within 4 to 5 hours after invoice submission. Juanita Marry, CEO of Accession Distribution, praised the partnership for its role in enhancing operational flexibility and unlocking new business avenues, attributing these benefits to the synergy between TruckIT's dispatch and ticketing visibility and Bolton Capital's optimized billing terms.</p><p>This collaboration is especially targeted at entities within the construction, waste, agricultural, and energy sectors that operate across multiple sites and are in dire need of quick access to working capital. Douglas Lindsay from Bolton Capital underscored the initiative's dual focus on not only supplying software solutions but also ensuring the direct provision of working capital to clients, thereby boosting operational efficiency and supporting business growth.</p><p>Against the backdrop of the U.S. dump truck services market's valuation at around $30 billion in 2024 and its anticipated expansion, the demand for innovative solutions such as those offered by TruckIT and Bolton Capital is increasingly critical. Malcolm Smith of the National Dump Truck Association highlighted the industry's fragmented nature and the negative repercussions of manual ticketing on cash flow and scalability.</p><p>Pace Davis, President of TruckIT, remarked that the incorporation of Bolton Capital's services into their platform significantly enhances its appeal, particularly for small to mid-sized businesses looking to scale operations without the burden of increased overhead or risk.
