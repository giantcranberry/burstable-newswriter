<p>Tropic Air Rescue, founded by aviation expert Anthony Marinello, has emerged as the first private helicopter air ambulance service in the Bahamas and Florida, introducing a subscription-based model for rapid emergency medical transport. This innovative service is designed to tackle the pressing issue of delayed emergency response in remote and island locations, where conventional fixed-wing air ambulances may require up to 36 hours to reach those in need.</p><p>The service operates using twin-engine Sikorsky S-76B helicopters, staffed with certified trauma paramedics, nurses, and critical care physicians, ensuring immediate deployment and 24/7 emergency coverage. Membership options are available for individuals, families, and marine vessels, offering subscribers peace of mind without the burden of out-of-pocket expenses during rescues. In its inaugural year, Tropic Air Rescue has successfully conducted over 35 rescues, including challenging nighttime trauma evacuations from private islands and yachts, thereby establishing a new benchmark for emergency medical services in the region.</p><p>A distinguishing feature of Tropic Air Rescue is its FAA certification and cabotage clearance, enabling the transport of Bahamian citizens between islands for emergency careâ€”a pioneering achievement in the area. The expertise of the company's leadership team, including Marinello and Medical Director Dr. Mauricio Lynn, who have extensive backgrounds in emergency response and trauma care, further enhances its credibility as an essential service for the Bahamas and Florida's coastal communities.</p><p>For more details on membership plans and services, visit <a href='https://www.tropicairrescue.com' rel='nofollow' target='_blank'>https://www.tropicairrescue.com</a>.</p>
