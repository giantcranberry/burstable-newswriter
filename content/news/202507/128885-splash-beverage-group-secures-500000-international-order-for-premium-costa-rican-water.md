<p>Splash Beverage Group, Inc. (NYSE American: SBEV) has announced a significant international order for its newly acquired premium bottled water from Costa Rica, marking a pivotal moment for the company. The order, valued at $500,000, comes from the All Day Group, a distinguished retail and convenience operator in the United Arab Emirates, underscoring the global appeal of the water's unique qualities.</p><p>The water, sourced from a volcanic aquifer in Costa Rica, is naturally alkaline and rich in minerals, attributes that have garnered attention from premium retailers and hospitality groups worldwide. This early demand, even before full-scale commercialization, highlights the product's potential in the wellness and luxury hydration markets. The All Day Group's selection of Splash's water for its upscale retail locations further validates the brand's positioning in the elite hydration space.</p><p>William Meissner, President and Chief Marketing Officer of Splash Beverage Group, expressed enthusiasm about the order, stating it confirms the company's belief in the value of the Costa Rican water source. The partnership with Utopia Holdings has been instrumental in leveraging international retail and hospitality relationships to accelerate interest in the product, particularly in markets with a focus on wellness and sustainability.</p><p>This development follows Splash's acquisition of exclusive rights to the Costa Rican water source, a transaction valued at $20 million. Independent analyses have confirmed the water's superior mineral content and purity, positioning it favorably against leading brands in the category. The initial order from the All Day Group not only provides momentum for Splash's commercial launch but also serves as a testament to the global relevance and demand for premium, health-focused beverage options.</p><p>For more information on Splash Beverage Group and its portfolio, visit <a href='https://www.SplashBeverageGroup.com' rel='nofollow' target='_blank'>https://www.SplashBeverageGroup.com</a>, <a href='https://www.copadivino.com' rel='nofollow' target='_blank'>https://www.copadivino.com</a>, <a href='https://chispotequila.com' rel='nofollow' target='_blank'>https://chispotequila.com</a>, and <a href='https://www.pulpo-loco.com' rel='nofollow' target='_blank'>https://www.pulpo-loco.com</a>.</p>
