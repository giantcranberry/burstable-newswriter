<p>The recent imposition of a 93.5% tariff on graphite imports from China by the Trump administration marks a significant escalation in trade tensions between the two economic powerhouses. Graphite, a critical component in the production of electric vehicle (EV) batteries, is predominantly sourced from China by U.S. automakers. This tariff could lead to a substantial increase in production costs for these companies, potentially slowing down the growth of the EV market in the United States.</p><p>Companies such as Mullen Automotive Inc. (NASDAQ: MULN), which are heavily invested in the EV sector, may find themselves under increased financial strain due to these tariffs. The reliance on Chinese graphite highlights a vulnerability in the U.S. EV supply chain, prompting calls for diversification of sources or investment in domestic production capabilities.

The EV industry, seen as a key player in reducing carbon emissions, faces potential setbacks if these trade barriers lead to increased costs and reduced competitiveness of electric vehicles in the market.</p>
