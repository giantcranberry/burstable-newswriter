<p>Healthcare Triangle, Inc. (Nasdaq: HCTI), a leader in digital transformation solutions for the healthcare and life sciences industries, has taken a significant step to ensure its compliance with Nasdaq Capital Market listing requirements. The company announced a 1-for-249 reverse stock split of its common stock, effective from 12:01 a.m. Eastern Time on August 1, 2025. This strategic maneuver is designed to increase the company's share price to meet the Nasdaq's minimum bid price requirement of $1.00, thereby securing its continued listing under the symbol 'HCTI'.</p><p>The decision, which garnered stockholder approval at a special meeting on February 26, 2025, will see every 249 shares of the company's outstanding common stock consolidated into one share.

Importantly, the reverse stock split will not affect the par value or the total number of authorized shares. In cases where fractional shares would result, stockholders will receive a rounded-up share at the participant level, ensuring fairness in the adjustment process.</p><p>Stockholders recorded as of August 1, 2025, will be notified of their revised share ownership by VStock Transfer, LLC, the company's transfer agent.
