<p>Deepwatch, a prominent player in the Managed Detection and Response (MDR) sector, has been selected to join Google Cloud's Managed Security Services Provider Initiative. This strategic partnership merges Deepwatch's Precision MDR with Google's Security Operations platform, offering organizations around-the-clock managed detection and response services. The collaboration is designed to deliver end-to-end visibility, AI-powered automation, and expert human analysis across diverse environments, enabling faster threat detection and response, minimizing false positives, and enhancing overall security.</p><p>The initiative comes at a time when organizations grapple with the complexities of unified visibility and precision protection, exacerbated by the surge in remote work, cloud computing, and IoT proliferation. These challenges are further intensified by a shortage of Security Operations Center (SOC) talent and the strain of maintaining continuous security operations, which often leads to analyst fatigue and sluggish threat response. John DiLullo, CEO of Deepwatch, underscored the company's commitment to bolstering customers' security resilience by optimizing the monitoring of their existing security investments, thereby alleviating alert fatigue.</p><p>This partnership is poised to offer three pivotal benefits: comprehensive threat protection through the synergy of Deepwatch's operational expertise and Google's cloud-native security tools; enhanced efficiency via AI-driven automation for threat detection and reduction of false positives; and scalable expert analysis, utilizing Deepwatch's security professionals for in-depth contextual analysis and actionable recommendations. Jonas Kelley, Head of MSSP Partnerships for Google Cloud Security, pointed out the collaboration's potential to equip organizations with the necessary visibility and intelligence to combat sophisticated threats effectively.</p><p>Distinct in the managed security services landscape, this solution provides cloud-native scalability and speed, advanced threat intelligence, and a flexible, technology-agnostic approach. It assures organizations complete transparency into every detection and decision, readiness for compliance, and cost-efficient operations, including high-speed search capabilities across extensive data sets. For leaders in enterprise security, this partnership offers a pathway to achieving tangible security improvements, aligning security strategies with business goals, and preserving trust amidst an ever-changing threat environment.</p>
