<p>New Pacific Metals Corp. (NYSE American: NEWP) (TSX: NUAG) is positioning itself as a key player in the global silver market through the development of its two flagship projects in Bolivia, Silver Sand and Carangas. These projects stand out as some of the world's premier undeveloped open-pit silver assets, with the combined capacity to produce close to 19 million ounces of silver each year. The Silver Sand project, according to a June 2024 preliminary feasibility study, is projected to deliver 12 million ounces of silver annually over a 13-year mine life. The Carangas project, as detailed in a September 2024 preliminary economic assessment, aims to contribute an additional 6.6 million ounces of silver per year from its upper silver-lead-zinc zone for 16 years.</p><p>This strategic development by New Pacific Metals Corp. arrives at a pivotal moment for the global silver market, which is currently experiencing a significant supply shortfall. The company's efforts to advance these projects through the permitting process in Bolivia—a country celebrated for its abundant geological resources—highlight the potential of these initiatives to alleviate pressure on the silver supply chain. With both the Silver Sand and Carangas projects progressing towards production, New Pacific Metals Corp. is on the verge of establishing itself among the elite primary silver producers worldwide. This move not only promises to meet the escalating demand for silver but also offers a sustainable approach to mining in a resource-rich region.</p><p>For further insights into how New Pacific Metals Corp.'s projects could reshape the silver market, visit <a href='https://ibn.fm/5XArY' rel='nofollow' target='_blank'>https://ibn.fm/5XArY</a>.</p>
