<p>16 Handles, a renowned name in the self-serve frozen yogurt and soft serve industry, is making its way to Cobble Hill, Brooklyn, with a new location opening on July 26, 2025. Situated at 300 Court St., this establishment is poised to become a hub for dessert aficionados, featuring an impressive selection of 16 soft serve flavors and more than 50 premium toppings. The venture is spearheaded by franchisees Eric Farber and Dylan Vas, who are leveraging their friendship and shared enthusiasm for frozen yogurt to address the scarcity of family-oriented dessert venues in Brooklyn.</p><p>The Cobble Hill outlet, encompassing over 1,000 square feet and offering both indoor and outdoor seating, is expected to create employment opportunities for 15 local residents. Farber and Vas, with their backgrounds in finance and consulting, view this opening as the initial phase of a broader strategy to extend 16 Handles' footprint across Brooklyn and Queens, focusing on communities that prioritize both quality desserts and a sense of togetherness.</p><p>To commemorate the launch, 16 Handles will organize a Grand Opening event, providing free frozen yogurt to the first 100 customers and half-price offerings thereafter. The shop's design will feature contemporary aesthetics with lounge-style seating and extended operating hours, aiming to accommodate a diverse clientele ranging from families to groups of friends and couples. The menu will cater to various dietary needs and preferences, including vegan, nonfat, and no sugar added options, alongside traditional ice cream flavors.</p><p>This new opening not only enriches Cobble Hill's dessert scene but also embodies the entrepreneurial journey of its owners, who are shifting from corporate roles to small business ownership. Their narrative, coupled with the shop's emphasis on fostering community connections through shared dessert experiences, underscores the vital role local businesses play in creating inclusive spaces that bring people together.</p>
