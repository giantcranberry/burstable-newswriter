<p>Fusion Fuel Green PLC (Nasdaq: HTOO) has marked a significant milestone in its corporate turnaround by achieving Nasdaq compliance and making strategic acquisitions to enhance its market position. The company's execution of a 1-for-35 reverse stock split on July 14 was pivotal in meeting Nasdaq's listing requirements, a step that underscores its commitment to financial stability and operational growth following the insolvency of its Portuguese subsidiary in 2024.</p><p>In an aggressive expansion strategy, Fusion Fuel acquired a controlling interest in Quality Industrial Corp. and its subsidiary, Al Shola Al Modea Gas Distribution LLC ('Al Shola Gas'), setting a revenue target of $20 million by 2025. Al Shola Gas has already demonstrated strong performance, securing $7.4 million in new contracts since November and adding over 1,800 residential and two commercial service agreements, which contribute $0.9 million in recurring annual revenue. These achievements highlight Fusion Fuel's increasing influence in the energy sector.</p><p>To further solidify its financial standing, Fusion Fuel raised $2.58 million through convertible notes and established a $25 million equity line, providing the necessary capital to fuel its growth ambitions. The company's strategic moves include the planned acquisition of a UK-based fuel distributor for approximately Â£50 million and a partnership between its subsidiary Bright Hydrogen Solutions Ltd. ('BrightHy Solutions') and Sungrow Hydrogen Sci. & Tech. Co. Ltd. to deploy electrolyzer systems in Iberia. These initiatives reflect Fusion Fuel's dedication to expanding its global reach and advancing its technological capabilities.</p><p>CEO John-Paul Backwell has expressed optimism about the company's trajectory, emphasizing that Fusion Fuel has effectively resolved past challenges, infused new capital, and generated momentum through its Al Shola and BrightHy subsidiaries. With these strategic efforts, Fusion Fuel Green PLC is not only aiming for long-term shareholder value but also striving to establish itself as a leader in the burgeoning green hydrogen and energy solutions industry.</p>
