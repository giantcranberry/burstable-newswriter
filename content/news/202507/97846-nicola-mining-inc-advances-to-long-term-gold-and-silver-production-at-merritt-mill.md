<p>Nicola Mining Inc. has officially commenced long-term gold and silver concentrate production at its Merritt Mill in British Columbia, a significant step beyond its initial trial processing phase. This advancement was made possible by a substantial 3,100-tonne high-grade ore shipment from Talisker Resources Ltd., which is actively developing its Mustang Project. The Merritt Mill has undergone recent upgrades, including the integration of automation, gravity separation, and water recirculation systems, aimed at boosting operational efficiency and minimizing environmental impact.</p><p>Further expanding its operational scope, Nicola Mining has forged a partnership with Blue Lagoon Resources and is gearing up to process bulk samples from the Dominion Creek Gold Project. With a 75% economic stake in this venture, Nicola Mining is reinforcing its foothold in the mining sector. Peter Espig, CEO of Nicola Mining, emphasized the strategic value of the company's M-68 Mine Permit and the provincial government's support for responsibly conducted mining activities.</p><p>The shift to sustained production at the Merritt Mill underscores Nicola Mining's adeptness at harnessing cutting-edge milling technologies and cultivating strategic alliances to bolster both the local and national economy. The company's dedication to sustainable and efficient mining practices is clearly reflected in its technological upgrades and collaborative efforts, setting a benchmark for the industry.</p>
