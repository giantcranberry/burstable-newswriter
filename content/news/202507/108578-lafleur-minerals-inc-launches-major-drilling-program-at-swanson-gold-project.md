<p>LaFleur Minerals Inc. has initiated a fully funded 5,000-metre diamond drilling program at its Swanson Gold Project, following the acquisition of all necessary permits. This move highlights the company's dedication to progressing its gold exploration efforts in Québec, with the drilling program serving as a crucial phase in evaluating the project's viability and advancing towards production.</p><p>Alongside the drilling initiative, LaFleur has finalized an independent assessment of its Beacon Gold Mill, which confirmed the facility's optimal condition. The restart cost is estimated at C$4.1 million, significantly lower than the over C$71.5 million replacement value, underscoring the mill's strategic importance to LaFleur. This asset uniquely positions the company as a junior miner with both a prospective gold project and a fully permitted mill in a key mining area.</p><p>The company has also increased its Swanson land holdings to more than 18,300 hectares, further establishing its footprint in the region. This expansion, together with the Beacon Gold Mill's strategic benefits, boosts LaFleur's capacity to generate sustained value for its stakeholders. The Swanson Gold Project's accessibility via road and rail enhances its development prospects, providing direct connections to adjacent gold mills.</p><p>For additional details on LaFleur Minerals Inc. and its initiatives, visit <a href='https://ibn.fm/Y5cBl' rel='nofollow' target='_blank'>https://ibn.fm/Y5cBl</a>.</p>
