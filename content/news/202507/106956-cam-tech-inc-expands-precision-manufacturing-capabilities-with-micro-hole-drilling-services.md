<p>CAM Tech, Inc., a leader in wire EDM services since 1996, has recently expanded its service offerings to include micro hole drilling, a move that significantly enhances its manufacturing capabilities for clients in Waukesha, Wisconsin, and the broader Midwest region. This new service is designed to create starter holes in hard metals, a critical step in the production of precise openings required for various high-tech industries including aerospace, medical, electronics, and filtration.</p><p>The micro hole drilling process utilizes a rotating electrode to initiate openings in conductive materials, which are then refined using wire EDM to achieve micron-level accuracy and intricate shapes. This technique is especially advantageous for materials like titanium and carbide, as it minimizes mechanical stress and heat distortion, preserving the integrity of the parts being manufactured.</p><p>With the addition of two micro hole drilling stations to its existing fleet of 13 high-speed wire EDM machines, CAM Tech is now better equipped to handle both prototype development and full-scale production runs. The company's recent facility expansion by 6,000 square feet further bolsters its production capacity, enabling it to meet the demands of urgent projects through 24/7 operations.</p><p>The significance of micro holes in modern manufacturing cannot be overstated. They are essential components in a wide range of applications, from cooling systems in aerospace turbine blades to the precise openings required in medical devices and electronics, where exact tolerances are critical. The EDM process, which employs controlled electric sparks to remove metal, ensures that these components meet the highest standards of precision, with hole diameters as small as fractions of a millimeter.</p><p>CAM Tech's integration of micro hole drilling into its service portfolio underscores its commitment to providing cutting-edge manufacturing solutions. By combining its extensive expertise with state-of-the-art equipment, the company is poised to play a pivotal role in the advancement of precision manufacturing, offering unparalleled support to manufacturers in need of high-precision components for both prototypes and large-scale production contracts.</p>
