<p>Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-8th) has set a new benchmark for fundraising within Maryland's congressional delegation, securing over $2.5 million in the first half of the year, as per Federal Election Commission reports. This amount not only surpasses the $609,303 raised by Rep. Andy Harris (R-1st), the delegation's second-highest fundraiser, but also ranks Raskin as the 20th top fundraiser nationwide among House incumbents and challengers. With a robust $5.9 million in cash reserves as of June 30, Raskin's financial standing significantly outstrips that of his colleagues, including Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), who reported $2.2 million.</p><p>The significance of Raskin's fundraising extends beyond the sheer volume, marked by its geographic diversity with contributions from 44 states, though predominantly from Maryland. This widespread support reflects Raskin's elevated national stature, further amplified by his outspoken critiques of former President Donald Trump. The formidable financial resources Raskin has amassed afford him a distinct edge as the next election cycle looms, indicative of both his campaign's robust financial health and the broad-based endorsement of his political agenda.</p>
