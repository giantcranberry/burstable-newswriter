<p>Vivakor, Inc. (NASDAQ: VIVK), a prominent name in energy transportation, storage, reuse, and remediation services, has designated August 20, 2025, as the record date for its special dividend distribution of Adapti, Inc. (OTCID: ADTI) shares. This initiative is a testament to Vivakor's dedication to augmenting shareholder value through its stake in Adapti, renowned for its AdaptAI software platform designed for influencer-driven marketing.</p><p>Shareholders of Vivakor common stock as of the record date are set to receive about 0.0079 shares of Adapti common stock for each Vivakor share they hold, with exceptions for shares owned by executives who have opted out of participation. Given Adapti's current share price of $3.50, the dividend's total value is estimated at approximately $0.75 million. This distribution not only offers immediate value to Vivakor's shareholders but also signifies the company's belief in Adapti's future growth and its standing in the market.</p><p>The strategic importance of this move is further amplified by Adapti's recent acquisition of The Ballengee Group, a Dallas-based sports management agency with a roster of around 200 professional athletes. This acquisition is poised to expand Adapti's influence in the sports sector through influencer-driven marketing strategies, thereby promising enhanced value for Vivakor and its investors.
