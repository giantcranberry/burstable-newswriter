<p>Universal Parking has recently secured parking management contracts for two major mixed-use developments in Florida, signaling a strategic expansion within the state. These contracts encompass the management of parking operations at The Central in Downtown St. Petersburg and Wynwood Plaza in Miami, both of which play a crucial role in promoting community engagement and bolstering local economies.</p><p>The Central, a development adding 540 new parking spaces to St. Petersburg's EDGE District, represents a collaborative effort between Universal Parking and Ellison Development to meet the area's increasing parking demands. This garage, equipped with EV charging stations and offering 24/7 access, is a key element of the project's initial phase, which also includes a hotel, office tower, and affordable housing. This project is anticipated to greatly enhance the district's accessibility and economic dynamism.</p><p>In Miami, the parking garage at Wynwood Plaza, featuring 645 spaces, is an essential part of a 1 million square foot mixed-use campus aimed at fostering creativity and sustainability. In partnership with Evolution Parking and Guest Services, Universal Parking is poised to provide a parking experience that reflects the innovative ethos of Wynwood Place, offering benefits to tenants, residents, and visitors.</p><p>Tim Walsh, President and CEO of Universal Parking, highlighted the company's dedication to improving the parking experience and contributing to the enduring success of these developments. Through the integration of technology and customer-centric approaches, Universal Parking seeks to enable smoother access to these lively communities, encouraging more individuals to live, work, and discover these areas.</p>
