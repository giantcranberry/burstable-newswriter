<p>ESGold Corp. (CSE: ESAU) (OTCQB: ESAUF) has officially named Gordon Robb as its Chief Executive Officer, a move that signals the company's readiness to advance the Montauban Project into gold and silver production. Robb's background in global capital markets and mining finance, notably his recent position with Scottie Resources, equips him with the expertise necessary to guide ESGold through its critical transition from exploration to production.</p><p>The Montauban Project, situated 80 kilometers west of Quebec City, is currently in the final phases of construction and concentrate testing. An updated Preliminary Economic Assessment (PEA) is also in preparation, alongside an Ambient Noise Tomography survey aimed at uncovering the project's full potential. These developments reflect ESGold's strategic focus on achieving near-term cash flow without losing sight of long-term exploration opportunities.</p><p>Under Robb's leadership, with Paul Mastantuono continuing as Chairman and assuming the role of COO, ESGold is poised to reinforce its commitment to responsible mining practices. The Montauban Project not only offers immediate production prospects but also extensive exploration opportunities, aligning with the company's objectives of sustainable resource recovery and value creation.
