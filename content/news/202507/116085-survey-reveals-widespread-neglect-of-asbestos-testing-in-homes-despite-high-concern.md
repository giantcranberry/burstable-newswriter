<p>A recent national survey commissioned by Asbestos Claims.Law has brought to light a concerning disparity between the awareness of asbestos risks in homes and the实际行动 to test for this hazardous material. With an overwhelming 91% of homeowners admitting they have never tested their homes for asbestos, the survey underscores a modern real estate risk potentially affecting millions. The findings reveal that 35% of prospective homebuyers would reconsider a purchase upon discovering asbestos, indicating the material's significant impact on real estate transactions.</p><p>Further emphasizing the public's stance on asbestos safety, 82% of U.S. adults advocate for mandatory asbestos testing before any sale or renovation. Despite this strong public opinion, testing remains infrequent, even after events likely to disturb asbestos, such as natural disasters or home renovations. Alarmingly, only 8% of respondents reported testing their homes after a wildfire, flood, or similar event, and a mere 4% conducted tests before demolition.</p><p>The survey also sheds light on generational differences in asbestos awareness and concern. Millennials and Gen Z exhibit the highest levels of concern regarding asbestos exposure, while Gen Xers are most likely to withdraw from a home purchase if asbestos is detected. A notable lack of awareness persists about common asbestos hiding spots in homes, with insulation, textured 'popcorn' ceilings, and roofing materials being the most recognized sources.</p><p>The current absence of federal mandates for asbestos testing in real estate transactions or renovations creates a legal grey area, leaving critical health decisions in the hands of individuals who may not fully grasp the risks involved. Justinian C. Lane, an expert in asbestos safety and legal matters, stresses the urgent need for the real estate, construction, and inspection sectors to bridge this gap in public health oversight.</p>
