<p>Royalty Management Holding Corporation (Nasdaq: RMCO) has recently announced a significant discovery at its T.R. Mining & Equipment portfolio in Jamaica, where rare earth elements (REEs) have been identified alongside previously known deposits of titanium, vanadium, and iron ore. This finding, within a special exclusive prospecting lease encompassing 213 million tons of raw feedstock, highlights the site's potential as a cost-effective source of minerals vital for contemporary technology applications.</p><p>The initial evaluation by T.R. Mining had already pointed to substantial quantities of iron ore, titanium, and vanadium. However, the latest analysis of black sand samples has uncovered the presence of valuable REEs, essential for the production of rare earth magnets. These magnets are pivotal in a myriad of applications, ranging from electric vehicles and wind turbines to defense systems and consumer electronics, underscoring the strategic importance of this discovery.</p><p>Thomas Sauve, CEO of Royalty Management, highlighted the project's capability to provide some of the most competitively priced titanium, magnetite, and vanadium feedstock in the industry. With the mining permit process currently in progress, the company intends to utilize local Jamaican workforce for the separation and concentration of these minerals. Holding a 10% royalty on sales from the site, Royalty Management is focused on optimizing the resource's value for both the company and Jamaica.</p><p>This revelation not only broadens the spectrum of monetizable minerals at the T.R. Mining site but also establishes Royalty Management as a crucial contributor to the critical minerals supply chain. The company is dedicated to conducting further tests to accurately determine the concentrations and distribution of these elements, ensuring a thorough permit application. This advancement marks a strategic leap forward in harnessing Jamaica's mineral wealth, promising substantial employment opportunities and economic growth for the region.</p><p>For more information on Royalty Management Holding Corporation and its projects, visit <a href='https://www.royaltymanagement.com' rel='nofollow' target='_blank'>https://www.royaltymanagement.com</a>.</p>
