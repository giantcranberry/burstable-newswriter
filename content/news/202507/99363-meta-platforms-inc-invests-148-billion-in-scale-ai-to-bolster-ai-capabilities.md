<p>Meta Platforms Inc. has announced a substantial $14.8 billion investment to acquire a 49% stake in Scale AI, a leading provider of data-labeling services crucial for training artificial intelligence models. This strategic partnership will see Scale AI's CEO, Alexandr Wang, transition to Meta to helm a newly established 'superintelligence' lab, working in concert with a specialized research team under the direction of Mark Zuckerberg. This move represents a significant pivot for Meta, particularly in light of the underwhelming performance of its Llama 4 AI model and setbacks in the rollout of its 'Behemoth' flagship AI project.</p><p>The investment is not without its potential obstacles, as U.S. antitrust regulators are poised to scrutinize the deal under the provisions of the Clayton Act, a reflection of previous regulatory challenges Meta faced with its acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp. Nonetheless, the prospect of Scale AI's revenue potentially doubling to exceed $2 billion by 2025, coupled with the allure of early returns for investors, presents a compelling case for the partnership's viability.</p><p>On the financial front, Meta's stock witnessed a marginal decrease, closing at $700.45, down by $1.95 (â€“0.28%) on June 11, 2025, with trading activity amounting to around 4.8 million shares. This investment underscores Meta's unwavering dedication to advancing its AI technology and infrastructure, even as it contends with the dual pressures of regulatory compliance and the high expectations of the market.</p>
