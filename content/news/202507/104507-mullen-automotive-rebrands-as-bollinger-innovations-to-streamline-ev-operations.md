<p>Mullen Automotive Inc. (NASDAQ: MULN), a notable name in the electric vehicle (EV) manufacturing landscape, has unveiled plans to rebrand as Bollinger Innovations, with a scheduled change of its NASDAQ ticker symbol by August 15, 2025. This strategic rebranding involves the consolidation of its operations under the Bollinger brand, a move that includes relocating commercial vehicle functions to Oak Park, Michigan, and merging sales, marketing, and service divisions to achieve operational efficiency and cost reduction.</p><p>In a bid to bolster fiscal health and accelerate the development of its Class 1, 3, and 4 commercial EVs, Mullen Automotive has implemented significant cost-cutting measures since January. These include the elimination of 155 positions and a reduction in annual operating expenses by at least $35 million. The company's product lineup, featuring the Mullen ONE and THREE, along with the Bollinger B4—a vehicle distinguished by its 7,325-lb payload capacity and 185-mile range—is at the heart of its strategy to capture substantial sales orders in the current fiscal quarter.</p><p>The transition to Bollinger Innovations marks a pivotal step for Mullen Automotive as it seeks to fortify its stance in the fiercely competitive EV market. By aligning its operations and identity with the Bollinger brand, the company is poised to enhance its product offerings and solidify its market presence, particularly in the commercial EV segment. This move not only reflects Mullen Automotive's dedication to innovation and sustainability but also aligns with the broader industry shift towards environmentally friendly transportation solutions, underscoring the growing importance of EVs in achieving global sustainability goals.</p>
