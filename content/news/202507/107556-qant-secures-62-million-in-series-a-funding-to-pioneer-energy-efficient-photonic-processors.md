<p>Q.ANT, a Stuttgart-based innovator in photonic processing, has successfully raised €62 million in a Series A funding round, one of Europe's largest in deep tech, to commercialize its energy-efficient photonic processors. This development underscores a pivotal shift towards sustainable computing solutions, addressing growing concerns over data center energy consumption.</p><p>The company's photonic processors, which utilize light instead of electricity, have demonstrated potential for up to 30 times greater energy efficiency and 50 times the performance of traditional computing methods. Built on Thin-Film Lithium Niobate, Q.ANT's technology is designed to integrate seamlessly into existing data center infrastructures, presenting a sustainable alternative to conventional CMOS processors.</p><p>Dr. Michael Förtsch, Q.ANT's founder and CEO, articulated the company's ambition to redefine computing. The funding round, co-led by Cherry Ventures, UVC Partners, and imec.xpand, among others, will facilitate Q.ANT's expansion into the US and the development of next-generation processors. The addition of semiconductor experts Hermann Hauser and Hermann Eul to Q.ANT's advisory board further cements its standing in the global tech arena.</p><p>Christian Meermann of Cherry Ventures lauded Q.ANT's potential to revolutionize the data center semiconductor market, pointing to its early commercial success and innovative computing approach. Andreas Unseld from UVC Partners also commended Q.ANT's dedication to sustainable AI infrastructure, highlighting the investment's alignment with environmental sustainability objectives.</p><p>Q.ANT's Photonic Native Processing Server, now accessible for early access, signifies a major advancement in computing technology. With aspirations to be a foundational element of global AI systems by 2030, Q.ANT is leading the charge towards a new era of high-performance, energy-efficient computing.</p>
