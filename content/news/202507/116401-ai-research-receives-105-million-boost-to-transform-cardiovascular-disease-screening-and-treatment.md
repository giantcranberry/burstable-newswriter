<p>The American Heart Association has allocated $10.5 million to two pioneering research teams from Kaiser Permanente Division of Research and the University of Michigan, aiming to harness artificial intelligence (AI) for groundbreaking advancements in cardiovascular disease screening and treatment. This funding initiative targets the leading cause of death in the U.S., with potential worldwide benefits, by exploring innovative AI applications in healthcare.</p><p>Dr. David Ouyang's team at Kaiser Permanente is set to revolutionize echocardiogram diagnostics through AI, focusing on the early detection of kidney and liver diseases, which are known to increase cardiovascular risks. Their approach involves a comprehensive clinical trial across four healthcare systems, designed to perfect a method for alerting physicians to these critical health indicators promptly.</p><p>Parallelly, the University of Michigan, led by Dr. Cindy Hsu, is developing an AI-powered algorithm combined with wearable sensor technology to enhance CPR delivery during cardiac arrests. This innovative solution aims to provide real-time blood pressure monitoring, allowing emergency responders to adjust their techniques dynamically, thereby improving survival rates significantly.</p><p>These research endeavors highlight the American Heart Association's dedication to fostering cutting-edge solutions in cardiovascular health. By integrating AI into diagnostic and treatment protocols, the association is addressing the escalating challenge of cardiovascular, kidney, and liver diseases, setting a precedent for the use of technology in combating critical health issues globally.</p>
