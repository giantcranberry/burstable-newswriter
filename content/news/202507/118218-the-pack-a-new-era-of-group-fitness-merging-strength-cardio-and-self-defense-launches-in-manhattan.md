<p>Noah Neiman and Andy Stenzler, the innovative duo behind Rumble Boxing, are launching The Pack in Manhattan's Flatiron/Chelsea area, a groundbreaking group fitness studio that integrates strength training, high-intensity cardio, and street defense techniques. Slated for an early August 2025 opening at 49 W 23rd Street, The Pack offers a unique 50-minute workout designed to enhance functional strength, cardiovascular health, and self-defense confidence in a dynamic, community-driven environment.</p><p>The Pack's methodology is built on three foundational elements: TECHNOGYM equipment for strength and core training, Rogue Assault Bikes for endurance conditioning, and BOBs (Body Opponent Bags) for street defense and striking. This comprehensive approach not only prepares individuals for physical challenges but also equips them with skills for real-life situations, aligning with the studio's philosophy of embracing discomfort and cultivating a supportive community.</p><p>With a distinctive branding approach featuring a Cerberus-inspired logo and collaborations with Grammy-award-winning producers for a custom soundtrack, The Pack is set to deliver an unparalleled fitness experience. Neiman and Stenzler's ambition transcends physical training, aiming to establish an inclusive space that diverges from the conventional, transactional vibe of boutique fitness studios.</p><p>The introduction of The Pack marks another milestone in Neiman and Stenzler's journey of redefining the fitness industry, following their achievements with Rumble Boxing. The studio's proximity to Rumble's inaugural location highlights their dedication to influencing New York City's fitness landscape significantly. Early enrollment for classes and memberships will commence on July 15, providing an opportunity for fitness enthusiasts to be part of this innovative fitness movement.</p>
