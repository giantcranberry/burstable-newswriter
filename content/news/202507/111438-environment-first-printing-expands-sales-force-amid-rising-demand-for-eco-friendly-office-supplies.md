<p>Environment First Printing (EFP), a leader in bio-based toner products, has significantly expanded its sales team, reporting a 250% increase in outside sales representatives over the past two months. This growth underscores a rising demand for environmentally friendly office supplies and highlights EFP's successful sales strategy that appeals to individuals looking for additional income opportunities.</p><p>CEO Matthew Airey credits the expansion to heightened consumer awareness of environmental issues, the appeal of domestically produced goods, and the company's attractive commission structure, which offers up to 50% of gross profit. This approach has drawn a diverse group of sales representatives, including retirees and stay-at-home parents, to join EFP's ranks.</p><p>EFP's bio-based toner products stand out not only for their environmental benefits but also for their cost-effectiveness. These products are 30% cheaper than those offered by major retailers, providing significant savings to consumers. Additionally, each EFP toner cartridge saves approximately 3 liters of petroleum compared to traditional options, further emphasizing the company's commitment to sustainability.</p><p>With the launch of its new website, <a href='https://www.environmentfirstprinting.com' rel='nofollow' target='_blank'>https://www.environmentfirstprinting.com</a>, EFP is set to enhance its mission of reducing reliance on foreign oil and promoting renewable resources in the printing industry. This expansion and the company's innovative approach reflect a broader shift towards sustainability in office supplies, offering both ecological and economic advantages.</p>
