<p>Mullen Automotive Inc. (NASDAQ: MULN), through its subsidiary Bollinger Motors, has pinpointed August as a pivotal month for fleet operators aiming to benefit from substantial incentives for commercial electric vehicles (EVs). The New York Truck Voucher Incentive Program (NYTVIP), which is expected to be replenished, offers up to $144,000 in point-of-sale vouchers. These incentives, when combined with the federal 45W tax credit that provides up to $40,000 for Class 4 vehicles, offer significant upfront savings for businesses transitioning to electric fleets.</p><p>The federal credits are slated to expire after September 30, 2025, a deadline that Bollinger Motors is emphasizing to encourage prompt action from interested parties. The Bollinger B4, an all-electric Class 4 chassis cab, stands out as a prime candidate for these programs. Engineered with a focus on performance, safety, and adaptability for urban fleet operations, the B4 is central to Mullen Automotive's strategy to penetrate the commercial EV market.</p><p>This development is part of Mullen Automotive's broader efforts to expand its commercial dealer network and secure necessary certifications and approvals, thereby increasing the attractiveness and availability of its EV offerings.
