<p>Bernie’s Book Bank has partnered with Newcastle Systems to transform its book distribution process through the use of mobile-powered cart technology. This innovative approach is set to improve operational efficiency by streamlining the sorting, inventory management, and packing of books, thereby accelerating the delivery of books to children in need. Tommy Lacher, Director of Information Technology & Supply Chain at Bernie’s Book Bank, praised the technology for its ability to cut down inventory time and enable a single individual to accomplish tasks that once required multiple people.</p><p>Newcastle Systems' mobile-powered carts are at the heart of this transformation, designed to deliver power and data directly to the point of task. This minimizes unnecessary movement and significantly enhances productivity. Kevin Ledversis, VP of Sales at Newcastle Systems, highlighted the synergy between the company's goal to empower workers and Bernie’s Book Bank's mission to promote literacy among children. This partnership not only raises the bar for nonprofit logistics but also highlights the critical role of human-centered solutions in achieving operational excellence.</p><p>Currently, Bernie’s Book Bank serves 315,000 children in the Chicagoland area, with ambitions to extend its impact further. Founder Brian Floriani shared the organization's broader vision of fostering community and creating lasting connections through the gift of book ownership. The collaboration with Newcastle Systems marks a significant milestone in this journey, promising to bring the joy and educational benefits of reading to an even greater number of children.</p>
