<p>A recent report by EverDriven, titled 'The Future of Modern Student Transportation and Safety Report,' sheds light on a significant shift in how school districts across the United States are approaching student transportation. With 98% of districts actively modernizing their systems, the focus is squarely on enhancing safety, equity, and access for all students, especially those in vulnerable situations such as homelessness, foster care, or requiring specialized accommodations.</p><p>The findings reveal that 95% of districts expect their transportation budgets to increase by an average of 26% over the next five years, with two-thirds having already secured the necessary funding. Nearly half of the districts are in the process of implementing modern solutions, and an additional 47% plan to follow suit within the same timeframe. Technology is at the heart of these modernization efforts, with 68% of districts acknowledging its significant or critical role in their strategies. Key technological priorities include real-time GPS tracking, AI-assisted routing, and driver monitoring systems.</p><p>Equity concerns are driving much of this change, with 88% of districts reporting disparities in transportation access among different student groups. Operational challenges, such as high maintenance costs and inefficient routes, further underscore the need for modernization. In response, districts are turning to technology-enabled solutions like onboard camera systems, collision avoidance technology, and communication apps to improve safety and foster better family engagement.</p><p>Alternative transportation models are also becoming more prevalent, with 37% of districts already utilizing them to serve students who fall outside standard bus routes. Looking ahead, investments are expected to focus on collision avoidance systems, safety training programs, and AI-powered logistics. Mitch Bowling, CEO of EverDriven, remarked on the transformation underway in student transportation, emphasizing the move towards systems that are more inclusive and reliable.</p><p>This report, based on insights from over 500 U.S.-based district leaders, including Superintendents and Transportation Directors, underscores the critical importance of modernizing student transportation. The goal is clear: to ensure every child has a dignified and safe path to education, leveraging technology and innovative models to overcome existing barriers.</p>
