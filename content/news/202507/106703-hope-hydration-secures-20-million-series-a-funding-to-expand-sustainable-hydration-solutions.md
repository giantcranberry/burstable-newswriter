<p>HOPE Hydration, a company at the forefront of combating single-use plastic waste through sustainable hydration solutions, has successfully closed a $20 million Series A funding round. This significant financial boost, led by Pentair plc with contributions from Burnt Island Ventures, is poised to propel the company's mission forward. The funding will facilitate HOPE Hydration's expansion into new markets, enhance its manufacturing capabilities, spur product innovation, and forge stronger strategic partnerships to maximize its global footprint.</p><p>Founded by Jorge Richardson, Cristina Gnecco, and Dave Tigue, HOPE Hydration is built on the belief that access to clean water is a fundamental human right. The company's HydroStations, which utilize Everpure filtration technology from Pentair Water Solutions, are revolutionizing public hydration. These stations provide free, high-quality, chilled drinking water in various public spaces, including cities, stadiums, airports, and commercial areas. Beyond hydration, the HydroStations are equipped with proprietary IoT technology for real-time monitoring of refill counts and environmental savings, alongside digital advertising displays that allow for cost-free installations at venues.</p><p>Since launching in 2023, HOPE Hydration has made remarkable strides, enabling over 2 million refills in collaboration with major events, Fortune 500 brands, and public spaces. With the new funding, the company has set an ambitious target of reaching 10 million refills by the end of the year. This goal underscores HOPE Hydration's commitment to making clean water accessible worldwide while addressing the pressing issue of plastic pollution.</p><p>Adrian Chiu, EVP and President of Pentair Water Solutions, highlighted the synergy between Pentair's mission to enhance water quality sustainably and HOPE Hydration's objectives. This partnership not only leverages Pentair's advanced filtration technology and expertise but also amplifies the impact of HOPE's innovative solutions. HOPE Hydration's approach to public hydration—melding technology, environmental responsibility, and community engagement—offers a sustainable alternative to single-use plastics, setting a new standard for how businesses can contribute to environmental conservation and public health.</p>
