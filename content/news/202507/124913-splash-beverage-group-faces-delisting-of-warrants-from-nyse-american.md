<p>Splash Beverage Group, Inc. (NYSE American: SBEV) has been informed by NYSE Regulation that its warrants, trading under the symbol SBEV-WT, are subject to delisting proceedings effective immediately. This action, rooted in Section 1001 of the NYSE American Company Guide, stems from the warrants' low trading price, rendering them unsuitable for continued listing. The company has the option to appeal by July 30, 2025, but has indicated it will not pursue this route.</p><p>Importantly, the delisting does not affect the status of Splash Beverage Group's common stock, which continues to be listed on the NYSE American under the ticker SBEV. The company's operational activities and its obligations to file reports with the SEC remain unchanged. Following delisting, there is a possibility for the warrants to be traded on an over-the-counter market, such as the OTC Pink tier, provided a market maker applies and FINRA grants approval, though this outcome is not assured.</p><p>This scenario sheds light on the broader challenges companies encounter in adhering to exchange listing standards and the potential repercussions for investors holding warrants or similar securities. It serves as a reminder of the critical need for investors to stay informed about the performance of their securities and the regulatory landscape to navigate such developments effectively.</p>
