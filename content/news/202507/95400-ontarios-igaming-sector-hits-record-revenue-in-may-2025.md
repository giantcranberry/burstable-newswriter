The GGR reached an all-time high of CA$338.0 million, showcasing a 2.9% increase from the previous record and a significant 40.3% rise compared to May of the previous year. This remarkable growth was paralleled by total player wagering exceeding CA$8 billion for the first time, a 28.9% increase year-on-year, underscoring the sector's expanding appeal and vitality.</p><p>Online casinos were the primary drivers of this surge, generating CA$259.8 million in revenue and accounting for 77% of the total iGaming revenue. Sports betting also demonstrated strong performance, contributing CA$71.8 million, while online poker experienced an 18.9% increase in revenue. Interestingly, despite a slight decline in active player accounts, the average revenue per active player account rose by 10.0%, indicating that engaged players are spending more, a trend that could signal a maturing market with higher value customers.</p><p>With 50 licensed operators and 86 websites, Ontario's iGaming market stands as a competitive and flourishing sector.
