<p>The Northern Virginia housing market in June 2025 showcased a notable upswing, with home sales climbing by 13.6% and the total transaction volume by 15.2% compared to the previous year, as reported by the Northern Virginia Association of Realtors. This surge was largely attributed to a 52.7% increase in active listings, which enriched the market with more options for buyers and fostered a more balanced environment.</p><p>Despite the heightened inventory, the median sold price experienced a marginal decline of 1.3%, settling at $770,000. Additionally, the average time homes spent on the market extended to 20 days, marking a 42.9% increase from June 2024. These indicators point towards a market in the midst of adjusting to evolving conditions, thereby granting buyers enhanced flexibility and prompting sellers to refine their approaches.</p><p>Ryan McLaughlin, CEO of NVAR, characterized the current market dynamics as a 'healthy recalibration,' emphasizing the advantage it offers buyers in terms of having more time to deliberate on their purchases. Veronica Seva-Gonzalez, a board member at NVAR, also highlighted the broader selection now available to buyers, facilitating a more considered home-buying process.</p><p>Looking ahead, NVAR expects the market to maintain its steady momentum, particularly if more homeowners opt to list their properties. The enduring appeal of Northern Virginia, bolstered by its economic stability, esteemed educational institutions, and high quality of life, continues to draw buyers, underpinning the region's housing market resilience.</p>
