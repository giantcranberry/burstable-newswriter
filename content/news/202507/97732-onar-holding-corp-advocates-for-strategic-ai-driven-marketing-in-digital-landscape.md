<p>In the digital marketing sector, ONAR Holding Corp. (ONAR) is setting a new precedent by prioritizing strategic planning over the previously celebrated 'move fast and break things' approach. The company utilizes its proprietary AI platform, Cortex, to enhance performance media, SEO, and specialized marketing efforts, marking a significant shift towards data-driven strategies. This approach is supported by a 2024 McKinsey report, highlighting that sustainable growth in the digital age requires strategic consistency and the integration of AI into marketing operations.</p><p>The traditional mindset of rapid execution without regard for long-term strategy is being reconsidered across the industry. ONAR's methodology, which combines data, technology, and creativity in a measurable framework, aligns with the broader movement towards more deliberate and AI-enhanced marketing strategies. The McKinsey study further reveals that businesses fully integrating AI into their marketing strategies are experiencing revenue growth rates two to three times higher than those that do not, underscoring the competitive advantage offered by AI.</p><p>For those interested in exploring ONAR's innovative strategies further, visit <a href='https://ibn.fm/ONAR' rel='nofollow' target='_blank'>https://ibn.fm/ONAR</a>.
