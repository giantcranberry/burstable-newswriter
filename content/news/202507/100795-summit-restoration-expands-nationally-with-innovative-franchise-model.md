<p>Summit Restoration, a Florida-based property restoration company known for its rapid growth and success in restoring over 2,000 homes and commercial properties, is taking a significant step towards national expansion. The company, founded in 2023 by CEO Raymond Tahhan, is introducing a franchising model designed to replicate its success across the United States. This initiative not only represents a pivotal moment for Summit Restoration but also offers a unique opportunity for entrepreneurs to enter the property restoration industry with a proven business model and cutting-edge technology.</p><p>The franchise program is built around comprehensive training in sales, operations, and claim management, coupled with access to proprietary AI-driven technology. This technology is aimed at streamlining the claims process and enhancing operational efficiency, setting Summit Restoration apart from competitors. The company's approach to franchising emphasizes personalized support and mentorship from its leadership team, a strategy that reflects Tahhan's commitment to empowering franchisees with the tools and knowledge needed for success.</p><p>Tahhan's vision for the franchise program is deeply rooted in his own experiences and challenges in building Summit Restoration. 'We're not some out-of-touch corporation. We remember what it's like to grind for every job, to juggle leads and invoices, to build trust one homeowner at a time,' Tahhan stated. This philosophy is central to the franchise model, which aims to provide real opportunities for individuals to build their own businesses under the Summit brand.</p><p>The initial phase of the franchising initiative will focus on the Southeast, Gulf Coast, and select Western states, with the first round of franchisees expected to be pre-qualified by the fourth quarter of 2025. This strategic expansion not only highlights Summit Restoration's ambition to become a national leader in the property restoration industry but also underscores the potential for innovative franchising models to transform traditional business sectors.
