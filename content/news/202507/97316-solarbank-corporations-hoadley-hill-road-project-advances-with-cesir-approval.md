<p>SolarBank Corporation's 7.2 MW Hoadley Hill Road ground-mount solar project in upstate New York has achieved a significant milestone with the successful completion of the Coordinated Electric System Interconnection Review (CESIR). This approval is a crucial step in the project's development, which aims to power around 850 homes through New York's grid, supported by the state's VDER compensation mechanism and potential NYSERDA NY-Sun incentives of up to US$0.395/W DC.</p><p>As a community solar initiative, the Hoadley Hill Road project enables residents and businesses to receive bill credits without the necessity for on-site solar installations. This model not only broadens access to renewable energy but also supports New York's goal of installing 6 GW of solar capacity by 2025. With over 100 MW of projects already built and a development pipeline exceeding 1 GW, SolarBank is now concentrating on expediting permitting and financing to begin construction.</p><p>The progress of the Hoadley Hill Road project highlights the increasing significance of community solar projects in meeting renewable energy objectives and lowering carbon emissions. By utilizing state incentives and regulatory structures, SolarBank is playing a pivotal role in fostering a sustainable energy future while delivering real advantages to local communities.
