<p>A recent WalletHub study has pinpointed Louisiana, Oklahoma, and New Mexico as the states with the highest proportions of at-risk youth in 2025, highlighting the significant challenges faced by young Americans not engaged in work or education. The comprehensive analysis compared all 50 states and the District of Columbia across 15 critical indicators, including disconnected youth rates, labor force participation, and youth poverty levels.</p><p>The findings reveal stark disparities among states, with Louisiana, Mississippi, and Nevada reporting the highest shares of disconnected youthâ€”2.9 times greater than New Hampshire, the state with the lowest share. New Mexico leads in the percentage of youth without a high school diploma, a rate double that of Hawaii, the state with the lowest share. Alabama records the highest proportion of overweight or obese youth, 1.5 times higher than Colorado, while Vermont has the highest rate of youth drug use, 2.5 times that of Utah. Notably, the District of Columbia's homeless youth rate is 34 times higher than Mississippi's.</p><p>This study not only maps the geographical disparities in youth challenges but also underscores the urgent need for targeted interventions to address these issues. The detailed findings and expert insights are available for further exploration <a href="here" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>, offering a valuable resource for policymakers and community leaders aiming to mitigate these disparities.</p>
