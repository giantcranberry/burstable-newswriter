<p>Veris Residential, Inc. (NYSE: VRE) has taken a significant step forward in its financial strategy by amending its $500 million credit facility. This amendment is a pivotal part of the company's 2025 corporate plan, focusing on reducing leverage and selling non-strategic assets. The revised facility comprises a $300 million Revolving Credit Facility and a $200 million delayed-draw Term Loan, featuring a leverage-based pricing grid and reducing the required secured properties in the collateral pool from five to two. These changes are anticipated to lower the company's corporate borrowing costs by an initial 55 basis points, with the possibility of additional savings.</p><p>Mahbod Nia, Chief Executive Officer of Veris Residential, emphasized the amendment's role in providing the company with a more favorable cost of capital and greater financial flexibility. This move is integral to Veris Residential's strategy to maximize stakeholder value through balance sheet optimization and the execution of up to $500 million in non-strategic asset sales. The recent $85 million sale of Signature Place, with $80 million of the proceeds allocated to reducing the Term Loan to $120 million, exemplifies the company's commitment to this strategy. These actions are crucial for achieving the company's goals of reducing Net Debt to EBITDA to below 10.0x by the end of 2025 and further to below 9.0x by the end of 2026.</p><p>The amendment was supported by a consortium of financial institutions, including JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and The Bank of New York Mellon as Joint Lead Arrangers and Joint Bookrunners, alongside Bank of America, N.A., Capital One, National Association, Goldman Sachs Bank USA, Royal Bank of Canada, Eastern Bank, and Associated Bank. This collective support highlights the financial community's confidence in Veris Residential's strategic direction and its potential to reshape its financial landscape.</p>
