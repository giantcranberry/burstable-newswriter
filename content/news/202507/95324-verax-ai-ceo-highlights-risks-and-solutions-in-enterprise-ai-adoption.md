<p>As artificial intelligence (AI) technologies become increasingly integral to enterprise operations, Leo Feinberg, Co-founder and CEO of Verax AI, has pinpointed two major risks that companies face: the misalignment between AI tools and specific company needs, and the substantial risk of data leakage into third-party AI tools. Feinberg argues that traditional security measures, such as employee training and pop-up warnings, are no longer sufficient to mitigate these risks. Instead, he advocates for the adoption of automated enforcement mechanisms to prevent data leakage effectively.</p><p>In response to these challenges, Feinberg has introduced Verax Protect, a innovative solution designed to automatically enforce corporate AI policies across all employee devices. This ensures the safe and secure use of popular AI tools like ChatGPT and Claude, particularly for regulated companies that must adhere to strict security, privacy, and compliance standards. Verax Protect distinguishes itself in the nascent AI security market by specifically addressing the needs of these highly regulated industries.</p><p>Looking forward, Feinberg anticipates that the cybersecurity industry will undergo significant evolution to counteract the increasing risks associated with AI. He envisions AI itself playing a crucial role in boosting workplace productivity, even as it introduces new vulnerabilities. Verax AI is committed to staying at the forefront of this evolution, with plans to expand Verax Protect to encompass new use cases. The goal is to develop a comprehensive solution that secures all employee interactions with third-party AI tools, thereby safeguarding sensitive corporate data in an increasingly AI-driven world.</p>
