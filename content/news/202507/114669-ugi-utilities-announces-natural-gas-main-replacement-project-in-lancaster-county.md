<p>UGI Utilities, Inc. has announced a significant infrastructure upgrade with the commencement of a natural gas main replacement project along Manheim Pike in Lancaster County, starting July 28, 2025. This project reflects UGI's ongoing commitment to providing safe and reliable natural gas service to its customers. The initiative is expected to be completed by mid-September, offering an opportunity for certain residences and businesses along the route to transition to natural gas, potentially reducing energy costs and environmental impact.</p><p>The construction will primarily affect Manheim Pike between Abraso Street and Dexter Avenue, as well as Dexter Avenue between Manheim Avenue and Manheim Pike. Initially, work will be conducted from 6:00pm to 6:00am, Monday through Friday, shifting to daytime hours (7:00am to 3:00pm) starting August 18. Residents and commuters should anticipate road closures, detours, traffic delays, and parking restrictions during these periods. Additionally, temporary interruptions in natural gas service are expected, requiring UGI to access properties for equipment inspection and relighting.</p><p>External factors such as adverse weather conditions and unforeseen working challenges may impact the project's timeline. Following the completion of the underground work, final paving and restoration activities are planned for a later date. This project not only underscores UGI's dedication to infrastructure improvement but also highlights the growing shift towards natural gas as a cleaner energy source.
