<p>Brera Holdings PLC (NASDAQ: BREA), an Ireland-based international holding company, has marked its presence in Italy's Serie B League by becoming the second multi-club ownership (MCO) entity alongside the City Football Group. This achievement not only elevates Brera's status within the league's top ownership echelons but also highlights the significant 245% surge in the market value of its owned club, SS Juve Stabia, to US$32 million during the 2024-25 season. The club's impressive performance, including a semifinal appearance in the Serie A promotion playoffs, has been a key driver behind this valuation growth, presenting Nasdaq investors with a compelling opportunity to partake in its upward trajectory.</p><p>The strategic integration of Brera Holdings into Serie B's elite ownership group was a focal point during the league's owners' meetings in Rome, as emphasized by Executive Chairman Daniel J. McClory. Known affectionately as 'The Second Team of Naples,' Juve Stabia's advancements extend beyond its financial valuation, encompassing enhanced potential for securing sponsorships and achieving capital appreciation. This progression underscores Brera Holdings' commitment to leveraging football as a vehicle for social impact, through the cultivation of a worldwide portfolio of emerging sports clubs. Such endeavors not only broaden the scope for tournament accolades and sponsorships but also pave the way for professional sports-related consulting services, further solidifying Brera's position in the global sports industry.</p>
