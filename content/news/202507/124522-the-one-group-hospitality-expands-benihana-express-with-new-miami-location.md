<p>The ONE Group Hospitality has unveiled its second Benihana Express location in Miami, situated within the Bayside Marketplace shopping center. This move signifies a strategic expansion of the company's fast-casual dining concept, following the successful debut of a similar outlet in the Brickell area earlier this year. The Benihana Express format is designed to make the renowned Benihana dining experience more accessible to a wider audience, offering quicker service without compromising on quality.</p><p>Emanuel 'Manny' Hilario, CEO of The ONE Group, highlighted the role of Benihana Express and franchising in the company's growth strategy. The collaboration with franchisee Erick Passo is part of a broader multi-unit development agreement, which includes plans for further expansion in Miami and other regions. The new 770-square-foot restaurant boasts a contemporary, minimalist design infused with Japanese aesthetics, serving a menu that features hibachi burritos, entrees, yakisoba bowls, and classic appetizers.</p><p>Passo shared his excitement about the second location, emphasizing the chance to provide high-quality food and efficient service under the esteemed Benihana brand.
