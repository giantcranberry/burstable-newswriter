<p>The Union Bank Co. has entered into a strategic partnership with Savage and Associates, an affiliate of Osaic, to significantly expand investment services across northwest and central Ohio. This collaboration represents a major development in the region's financial services sector, with approximately $127 million in assets under administration transitioning from LPL to Osaic. The partnership aims to provide Union Bank's clients, including retail customers, small-business owners, and the agricultural community, with access to a broader range of investment solutions and personalized financial advice.</p><p>Brian D. Young, president and CEO of The Union Bank Co., highlighted the partnership's potential to enhance service offerings and client satisfaction. The alliance leverages the Savage and Associates advisor network, known for its client-first approach, to deliver community-based financial guidance. Both Union Bank, with its 14 branches in rural communities, and Savage and Associates, supported by Osaic's resources, share a commitment to values-driven service and deepening market reach.</p><p>J.R. Toland, president and CEO of Savage and Associates, noted the alignment of values between the two organizations as a key factor in the collaboration. Kristen Kimmell, executive vice president of business development at Osaic, emphasized the partnership as a reflection of Osaic's dedication to supporting independent advisors through strategic collaborations. This initiative not only strengthens Osaic's leadership in wealth management strategies but also underscores the importance of regional market expansion.
