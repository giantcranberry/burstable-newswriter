<p>Safe Pro Group Inc. (NASDAQ: SPAI), a leader in AI-powered drone imagery solutions for defense and security, has been awarded a Buy rating and an $8 price target by Litchfield Hills Research. Analyst Theodore R. O’Neill spotlighted the company's patented mine detection technology, which has demonstrated significant effectiveness in Ukraine, offering a modern alternative to conventional demining techniques. The SpotlightAI(TM) platform, known for its ability to identify threats in less than 0.2 seconds, has already analyzed over 1.6 million drone images, proving its operational efficiency and scalability.</p><p>The company's broad portfolio, encompassing Safe Pro AI, Airborne Response, and Safe-Pro USA, serves a diverse clientele ranging from Florida Power & Light to humanitarian groups in Ukraine. The enactment of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which earmarks $33 billion for AI and drone technologies, positions SPAI favorably to capitalize on enhanced federal support. With revenue projections of $12.5 million by 2026 and expectations to reach breakeven by the end of the year, Safe Pro Group's growth trajectory appears robust.</p><p>O’Neill's $8 price target is grounded in a discounted earnings model, taking into account the company's anticipated revenue expansion, bolstered by substantial insider ownership and a distinctive technological edge. Safe Pro Group's AI ecosystem, featuring its SPOTD and SpotlightAI platforms, provides scalable image processing solutions across multiple applications, cementing its status as a pivotal entity in the autonomous surveillance and threat detection sector.
