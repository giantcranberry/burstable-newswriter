<p>South Fork Instruments has reached a significant milestone with its Exner turbidity and solids concentration sensors, which have been awarded both 3A Sanitary Standards and European Hygienic Engineering & Design Group (EHEDG) certifications. These accolades underscore the sensors' compliance with stringent hygienic design criteria, essential for the food and beverage sectors where accuracy and safety cannot be compromised.</p><p>John Daly, Technical Director at South Fork Instruments, emphasized the dual benefit of these certifications: enabling real-time monitoring of processes while maintaining the highest sanitary standards. The Exner sensors are engineered with features like electropolished 316L stainless steel, a surface finish under 0.8 Î¼m Ra to deter bacterial growth, complete drainability to eliminate contamination risks, and durability against common cleaning agents.</p><p>The implications of these certifications are vast, with applications spanning brewing wort clarification, dairy processing quality assurance, and sterile pharmaceutical production. By integrating these sensors, manufacturers can now conduct continuous turbidity monitoring, ensuring product integrity without breaching Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP) guidelines. This development marks a pivotal step forward in the instrumentation available for sanitary process monitoring, offering industries a tool that marries precision with safety.</p>
