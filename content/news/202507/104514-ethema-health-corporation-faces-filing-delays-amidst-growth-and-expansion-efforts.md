<p>Ethema Health Corporation has recently communicated to its shareholders regarding delays in the submission of its 2024 10-K filing and the subsequent first quarter results. The delay is attributed to ongoing audit-related processes, with the company expecting to file its first quarter review by the end of the month. This step is pivotal for Ethema as it prepares for its listing on the OTC-ID market, contingent upon the filing of its first quarter financials on form 10-Q. This move is a significant milestone in the company's strategy to enhance its market presence.</p><p>In terms of financial outlook, Ethema has provided revenue guidance, estimating approximately $3.5 million for the first quarter of 2025, with $2.1 million originating from its newly acquired operations in Kentucky. The company projects second quarter revenues to reach $4.4 million, subject to audit review, and anticipates $5.5 million for the quarter ending September 30, 2025. Ethema's goal is to achieve quarterly revenues of $6.3 million to reach optimum efficiency, showcasing a clear path toward growth through both acquisitions and organic expansion.</p><p>In Florida, Ethema's commitment to quality care and regulatory compliance has been reaffirmed through its re-certification by the Joint Commission, with facilities operating at 93% occupancy. Concurrently, in Kentucky, the company is advancing in certification and listing with Managed Care Organizations, which is expected to enhance its service offerings and capacity. With 347 licensed beds and a current census of around 230 customers, Ethema is well-positioned for further growth in the region.</p><p>Shawn Leon, CEO of Ethema, emphasized the seamless integration of Kentucky operations and the successful Joint Commission audit in Florida as significant accomplishments. These developments underscore Ethema's strategic focus on asset optimization and increasing patient numbers to boost profitability, indicating a strong future for the company's expansion and operational efficiency.</p>
