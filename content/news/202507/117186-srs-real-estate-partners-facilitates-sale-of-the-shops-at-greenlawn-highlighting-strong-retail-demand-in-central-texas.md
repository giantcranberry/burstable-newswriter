<p>The recent sale of The Shops at Greenlawn, a 22,970-square-foot retail center in Round Rock, Texas, by SRS Real Estate Partners, highlights the robust demand for retail properties in areas experiencing strong demographic growth. The property, situated at 3200 Greenlawn Boulevard, was acquired by an out-of-state, global real estate investor, with the transaction managed by SRS Capital Markets team members Cathy Nabours, Kyle Shaffer, and Sam Nichols.</p><p>With a 92% occupancy rate and nine tenants, The Shops at Greenlawn received multiple offers, showcasing the high investor interest in retail assets within the Austin Metropolitan Statistical Area and surrounding Central Texas communities. Nabours attributes this demand to the rapid construction of new housing subdivisions, which is outpacing the development of new retail spaces, making properties like The Shops at Greenlawn particularly attractive to investors.</p><p>Shaffer explained that the acquisition fits the buyer's strategy of investing in unanchored, high-quality essential service retail centers. The property's proximity to Dell Computers' headquarters and its location opposite a H-E-B Grocery center, combined with the forthcoming development of The District—a 65-acre mixed-use project—further increases its desirability.</p><p>This sale represents the third multi-tenant shopping center sold by the SRS team in the last three months, contributing to the firm's year-to-date deal volume exceeding $1.2 billion across more than 350 transactions nationwide. SRS Real Estate Partners remains a dominant player in the commercial real estate industry, with over 845 properties currently listed, valued at more than $3.7 billion.</p>
