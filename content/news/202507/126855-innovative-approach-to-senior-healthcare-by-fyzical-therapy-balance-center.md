<p>Melissa Sarhan, an Advanced Practice Registered Nurse with over twenty years of experience, is leading a transformative approach to senior healthcare at her FYZICAL Therapy & Balance Center in Glendale. By focusing on preventative care, Sarhan is addressing a significant gap in traditional healthcare models that typically intervene only after injuries have occurred. Her center specializes in evidence-based fall prevention and functional wellness programs, designed to empower older adults to preserve their independence.</p><p>Sarhan's transition from a Nurse Practitioner in internal medicine and post-acute care to the founder of FYZICAL was driven by her firsthand observations of patients experiencing preventable declines due to unaddressed balance or vestibular issues. Her leadership, informed by extensive clinical experience, emphasizes collaboration, clarity, and compassion, cultivating a team environment that values both professional expertise and human connection.</p><p>Looking to the future, Sarhan aspires for FYZICAL to emerge as a regional leader in balance and fall prevention care. Plans include expanding the team and enhancing collaborations with medical providers. What sets the center apart is its commitment to addressing the underlying causes of health issues, not just the symptoms, through detailed testing and the use of specialized equipment. Sarhan advocates for the importance of taking action, even in the face of uncertainty, a principle she applied when overcoming the challenges of establishing the center.</p><p>The ultimate goal of Sarhan's work is to make a profound difference in the lives of her patients by restoring their physical capabilities, freedom, and optimism. The center's success is illustrated by stories such as that of a stroke survivor who finally found the effective therapy they had been searching for years, highlighting FYZICAL's dedication to helping individuals not just recover, but truly reclaim their lives.</p>
