<p>Zeekr Intelligent Technology Holding Limited, a prominent player in the premium new energy vehicle market, has finalized a merger agreement with Geely Automobile Holdings Limited. This strategic move will result in Zeekr operating as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Geely, highlighting the accelerating consolidation trends within the electric vehicle (EV) sector. The agreement provides Zeekr shareholders with the choice between cash compensation or newly issued shares in Geely, with the cash option offering a notable premium over recent market prices.</p><p>The merger, anticipated to conclude in the fourth quarter of 2025, awaits approval from shareholders and the fulfillment of standard closing conditions.
