<p>The home services sector is demonstrating resilience and growth, a trend underscored by homeowners increasingly choosing to upgrade their existing properties rather than sell. Paul Flick, founder and CEO of Premium Service Brands (PSB), points to this shift as a key driver behind the robust performance of home service franchises. With a network of over 1,000 locations across the U.S. and Canada, PSB's franchises, including 360Â° Painting, ProLift Garage Doors, and Maid Right, are well-positioned to meet the demand for reliable and trusted home improvement services.</p><p>Flick attributes the sector's strength to its recession-resistant nature, noting that homeowners prioritize maintaining their largest investment over discretionary spending. This prioritization is evident in the consistent demand for PSB's wide range of services, from cosmetic updates to more significant home improvements. Although pre-listing home improvements play a minor role in their business, PSB's multi-brand ownership model enables franchisees to efficiently address diverse consumer needs, thereby building trust and encouraging repeat business.</p><p>For those considering entering the franchise market, Flick underscores the necessity of commitment, adequate capital, and strict adherence to PSB's proven operational system. Looking forward, Flick is optimistic about the continued expansion of the home services industry. This optimism is fueled by the ongoing housing shortage and homeowners' focus on safeguarding their equity through quality home maintenance and upgrades, signaling a promising future for the sector.</p>
