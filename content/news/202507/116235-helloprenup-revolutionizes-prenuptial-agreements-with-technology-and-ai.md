<p>HelloPrenup, founded by Julia Rodgers, a seasoned family law attorney, is changing the landscape of prenuptial agreements through technology. The platform offers an accessible and affordable solution for couples, guiding them through a comprehensive questionnaire that covers sensitive topics like property division and pet custody. This innovative approach not only facilitates open dialogue between partners but also aligns them on financial expectations and long-term goals, thereby strengthening their relationship.</p><p>Rodgers' inspiration for HelloPrenup stemmed from her firsthand experience in family law and the high divorce rates in the U.S. Recognizing a significant gap in legal and financial preparedness among couples, she launched the platform to democratize access to prenuptial agreements. Despite the challenges of self-funding and launching during the pandemic, HelloPrenup has achieved remarkable success, capturing 20% of the U.S. prenup market and operating in 48 states. The platform has protected over $25 billion in assets, a testament to its impact and reliability.</p><p>The appearance of HelloPrenup on Shark Tank in 2021 marked a turning point, attracting investments from Kevin O'Leary and Nirav Tolia. This endorsement has further accelerated the platform's growth and visibility. Rodgers challenges the common misconception that prenups are only for the wealthy, advocating for them as tools for love that encourage important conversations about money, marriage, and future planning. HelloPrenup caters to a wide range of clients, from individuals with significant debt to high-net-worth individuals, and has received acclaim from experts in family law and legal tech.</p><p>A recent strategic investment from The LegalTech Fund is set to propel HelloPrenup into new territories, including expansion into all 50 states and international markets. The funding will also support the development of new legal and relationship tech products, alongside enhancements to its AI-driven tools. Furthermore, HelloPrenup is launching a public service initiative in collaboration with Suffolk University Law School to improve access to affordable legal services, addressing a critical need in the legal system. This initiative underscores the platform's commitment to making legal preparedness accessible to all, reinforcing its mission to transform the way couples approach marriage and financial planning.</p>
