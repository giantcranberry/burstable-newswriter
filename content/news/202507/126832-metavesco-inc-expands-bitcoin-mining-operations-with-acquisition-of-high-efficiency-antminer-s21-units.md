<p>Metavesco, Inc. (OTC: MVCO) has taken a significant step forward in its Bitcoin mining operations by acquiring Bitmain Antminer S21+ 235TH units. This acquisition is expected to increase the company's total hashrate by approximately 3,000 TH/s, representing an 11.5% improvement in its fleet-wide capacity. The S21+ models are renowned for their efficiency, currently generating new Bitcoin at a cost of $55,000 per coin, which is substantially lower than the market price of around $120,000.</p><p>Ryan Schadel, President and CEO of Metavesco, highlighted the strategic importance of this expansion. 'Every new miner is a brick in the fortress weâ€™re building,' Schadel remarked. This move not only enhances Metavesco's mining capabilities but also elevates its standing within the institutional mining sector, providing access to larger and more lucrative mining pools.</p><p>This expansion is a key component of Metavesco's dual-asset digital treasury strategy, which also includes a recent investment in Ethereum. Schadel referred to Bitcoin as the company's 'digital gold' and Ethereum as 'the infrastructure layer of global finance.' This strategy underscores Metavesco's commitment to acquiring high-conviction digital assets to fortify its balance sheet while minimizing shareholder dilution.</p><p>For further details on Metavesco's strategic initiatives and operational updates, interested parties can visit <a href='https://www.metavesco.com' rel='nofollow' target='_blank'>https://www.metavesco.com</a>.
