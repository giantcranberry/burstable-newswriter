<p>The HR Research Institute's latest study, 'HR.com's State of Seasonal, Hourly and Volume Hiring 2025', sheds light on the transformative power of artificial intelligence (AI) and strategic hiring metrics in high-volume recruitment. Organizations leading in high-volume hiring are four times more likely to find AI tools effective and three times more likely to connect hiring metrics directly to on-the-job performance. This revelation underscores the growing importance of technology and data-driven strategies in recruitment processes.</p><p>Key metrics such as quality of hire, conversion rate, time to hire, and retention rate have been identified as crucial for long-term success in high-volume hiring. The study points out that technology, particularly applicant tracking systems and AI tools like chatbots and SMS automation, plays a pivotal role in modern recruiting efforts. Additionally, virtual job previews and employee referral tracking tools are highlighted for their contribution to scaling operations while enhancing the candidate experience.</p><p>Despite the advancements in recruitment technology, the study acknowledges ongoing challenges such as high turnover rates, mismatches between candidates and job requirements, and the inefficiencies of manual application processing. Debbie McGrath, CEO of HR.com, emphasizes the necessity of integrating the right data and tools with a strategic approach to navigate these obstacles effectively.</p><p>The findings suggest that a focus on performance-linked metrics and the adoption of cutting-edge technology can significantly improve both the quality and efficiency of hiring processes. For professionals seeking to explore these insights further, the study's webcast presentation, 'Hiring at Scale in 2025: New Insights into Seasonal, Hourly and Volume Recruiting', offers an in-depth look at the future of high-volume hiring.</p>
