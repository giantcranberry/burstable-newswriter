<p>DocsHunt is set to redefine the landscape of business documentation with its AI-powered workspace, offering entrepreneurs and professionals a groundbreaking solution to create business plans and strategy documents in a fraction of the traditional time. The platform's ability to condense a 150-hour process into just 5 minutes addresses the significant inefficiencies and frustrations associated with conventional document creation methods. Supporting various formats including DOCX and HWP, DocsHunt is launching in Korea on August 1, with plans for a global expansion by September 1.</p><p>At the heart of DocsHunt's innovation is its 'Core Plan' system, where users can input their business ideas and data. The platform's AI engine then generates fully formatted documents, eliminating the tedious task of repetitive copying and pasting across different document formats. This feature not only saves time but also enhances productivity, allowing users to concentrate on strategic aspects of their business. The platform's effectiveness is already evident, with over 10,000 users and more than $90,000 in revenue generated without the need for external funding.</p><p>DocsHunt's potential for scalability and its appeal to the business community are further underscored by its collaborations with Shinhan Card and support from Microsoft. These partnerships highlight the platform's recognition by major industry players and its capacity to meet the diverse needs of the global market. CEO Kim Sung-woo articulates the platform's mission to liberate users from the technical limitations of traditional tools, enabling them to focus on growth and strategy. With a range of pricing options, including a free Starter Plan, DocsHunt is accessible to a wide audience, promising to make a lasting impact on how business documentation is approached worldwide.</p>
