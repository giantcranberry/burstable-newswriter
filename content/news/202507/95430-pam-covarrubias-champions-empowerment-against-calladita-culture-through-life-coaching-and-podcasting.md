<p>Pam Covarrubias has made a significant shift from her corporate career to embrace roles as a life coach, speaker, and podcaster, with a focus on empowering first-generation women and femmes in the US. Her work confronts the 'Calladita Culture', a societal expectation that encourages silence and submission, particularly within Latino communities. Through her podcast, Cafe con Pam, and her coaching practice, Covarrubias uses trauma-informed techniques to help individuals heal from the impacts of silence, worth, power, commitment, and identity issues.</p><p>Her methodology is deeply personal, incorporating inner child work and subconscious exploration to foster alignment between mind, body, and soul. This approach aims not only for business success but for personal fulfillment, reflecting Covarrubias's own journey from the corporate world to entrepreneurship. Her transition was inspired by the realization that her true passion lay in coaching, leveraging her design and marketing background to create a practice rooted in authenticity and self-discovery.</p><p>One of the standout successes of Covarrubias's coaching is her assistance to a friend in transitioning from a W2 employee to a self-employed business owner, resulting in an income increase from $80K to $600K within a year. This achievement underscores the transformative potential of aligning one's business with their authentic self, a cornerstone of Covarrubias's philosophy.</p><p>By tackling 'Calladita Culture', Covarrubias is not only aiding individual women in reclaiming their voices and energy but is also challenging the societal norms that confine women's roles and behaviors. Her efforts highlight the critical need for deconditioning from societal expectations to live authentically and unapologetically, marking a significant step forward in the discourse on gender roles and personal empowerment.</p>
