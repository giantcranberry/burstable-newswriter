<p>Metavesco, Inc. (OTC: MVCO) has taken a significant step towards integrating cryptocurrency into its financial strategy by announcing the launch of Phase 1 of its Bitcoin Treasury Strategy. This initiative follows the securing of a $750,000 five-year term loan, which the company plans to use to retain all Bitcoin generated by its mining operations starting July 1, 2025. The funds will also support operating expenses and the expansion of Epic Labor, Metavesco's staffing business.</p><p>Ryan Schadel, President & CEO of Metavesco, highlighted the strategic importance of this financing, noting it marks a shift from the company's previous position as forced sellers to becoming long-term holders of Bitcoin. The treasury strategy unfolds in three phases: initially holding self-mined Bitcoin, then making systematic market purchases funded by capital from the staffing business, and ultimately allocating 10-15% of the company's total assets into Bitcoin by 2026.</p><p>The loan, which carries an annual percentage rate (APR) of 13% and is payable monthly over a 60-month term, is unsecured and non-convertible. This financial maneuver is a clear indication of Metavesco's ambition to diversify its portfolio and invest in the cryptocurrency market, reflecting a growing corporate trend towards recognizing Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class.</p><p>Metavesco's strategy not only demonstrates its commitment to leveraging innovative financial instruments but also positions the company to potentially capitalize on the long-term value appreciation of Bitcoin. This move is indicative of the broader acceptance of cryptocurrency within corporate treasury strategies, underscoring the evolving landscape of business finance and investment.</p>
