<p>Rocio Frej Vitalle, founder and CEO of SkyTL, has introduced a groundbreaking approach to disaster response by integrating advanced modeling with real-time data from satellites, drones, sensors, and ground responders. This integration provides dynamic, actionable intelligence to decision-makers during crises, significantly enhancing the effectiveness of emergency responses.</p><p>The inception of SkyTL stemmed from Frej Vitalle's master's program at the University of South Florida, where she recognized the potential to combine emerging technologies into a unified system. SkyTL's platform stands out by not only predicting risks but also continuously updating these assessments based on live data, making it an indispensable tool in disaster management.</p><p>The practical benefits of SkyTL's technology were demonstrated during the Thompson Fire in 2024, where its WindTL tool accurately predicted fire behavior overlooked by traditional models. This capability allowed fire crews to take preemptive actions, averting a potential catastrophe. In Contra Costa County, WindTL has played a key role in proactive risk mitigation and community education, receiving accolades from local emergency services.</p><p>SkyTL's strength lies in its ability to amalgamate and standardize data from various sources into a cohesive framework. This ensures that decision-makers, irrespective of their technical background, can efficiently manage evacuations, vegetation, and emergency resources. The platform's effectiveness has garnered support from NASA, NOAA, and the U.S. Air Force, providing SkyTL with the credibility and resources necessary for expansion and technological refinement.</p><p>Frej Vitalle's vision extends to a future where disaster response is proactive, data-driven, and accessible to communities of all sizes. By making advanced fire science available to small towns and rural areas, SkyTL aims to democratize disaster management tools, thereby saving lives and minimizing economic losses. This initiative represents a significant leap forward in how societies prepare for and respond to emergencies, setting a new standard for disaster management worldwide.</p>
