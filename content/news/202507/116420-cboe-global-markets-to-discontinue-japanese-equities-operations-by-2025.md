<p>Cboe Global Markets has announced its decision to discontinue its Japanese equities operations, which includes the Cboe Japan proprietary trading system and Cboe BIDS Japan block trading platform, with operations set to suspend on August 29, 2025. This strategic move is aimed at reallocating resources towards sectors with higher potential returns for shareholders, in response to changing business conditions that have rendered the Japanese equities business financially unsustainable.</p><p>Craig Donohue, CEO of Cboe Global Markets, highlighted the company's continued dedication to Japan through its global derivatives and data services, which are designed to cater to the needs of Japanese investors seeking international market access. The cessation of these operations is anticipated to yield adjusted expense savings of $2 million to $4 million in 2025, with annual savings expected to rise to $10 million to $12 million thereafter. Despite these changes, the impact on Cboe's revenue growth and operating expenses is projected to be minimal.</p><p>Additional information regarding the wind-down process will be shared during Cboe's second-quarter 2025 earnings call scheduled for August 1, 2025. Stakeholders interested in the details can access the live audio webcast and presentation through the Investor Relations section of Cboe's website at <a href='https://ir.cboe.com' rel='nofollow' target='_blank'>https://ir.cboe.com</a> under Events.</p>
