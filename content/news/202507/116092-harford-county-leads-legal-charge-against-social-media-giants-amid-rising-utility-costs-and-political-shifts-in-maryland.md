<p>Harford County's Board of Education is stepping into the national spotlight as one of the first to trial in a series of lawsuits targeting social media companies. These legal actions accuse the platforms of causing harm to children and seek substantial compensatory damages. This case is a critical part of a broader multi-district litigation, with Harford Schools chosen as one of six bellwether cases to evaluate the validity of these claims. The outcome could set a precedent for how social media companies are held accountable for their impact on youth.</p><p>Meanwhile, Maryland residents are preparing for an increase in electricity bills, with rates expected to rise between 1.5% and 5% starting in the summer of 2026. This adjustment follows a key electricity auction that reached its maximum price, affecting consumers across a 13-state region. The situation has sparked concerns over affordability and the need for sustainable energy solutions.</p><p>In a related development, Baltimore Gas and Electric has come under scrutiny for adjusting customer bills to cover the cost of a $17.5 million contract for a specially outfitted Ford F-150. This decision has drawn criticism from regulators and consumer watchdogs, who question the necessity and transparency of such expenditures.</p><p>Political landscapes are also shifting in Maryland, with U.S. Rep. Johnny Olszewski Jr. advocating for equal pay for WNBA players, and Erica Berge launching her Maryland House of Delegates campaign at a demolition derby. Anne Arundel County sees pharmacist Tom Wieland entering the race for County Council with a focus on traffic mitigation, while the Harford Sheriff's race gains a new contender in Jay Landsman Jr., adding complexity to the upcoming primary election.</p><p>Housing policy is another area of active debate, as Montgomery County moves to allow multi-unit homes on certain single-family lots to address housing shortages. This decision, made during a tense council meeting, reflects the ongoing challenges of balancing development with community needs.</p><p>These developments underscore the dynamic interplay of legal, economic, and political factors shaping Maryland's future, from the courtroom to the council chamber.</p>
