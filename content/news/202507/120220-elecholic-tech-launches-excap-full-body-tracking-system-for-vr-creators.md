<p>Elecholic Tech has made its EXCAP full-body tracking system available for retail, marking a significant advancement in making professional-grade motion capture technology accessible to virtual reality creators globally. Initially launched on Kickstarter in January 2025, the EXCAP system surpassed its funding goal, raising over $30,000 from more than 100 backers, with all units delivered by early June.</p><p>The EXCAP system utilizes Proprietary Optical-Inertial Fusion technology, a innovative approach that integrates vision data and magnetometer readings to correct IMU drift in real time. This ensures high accuracy without the necessity for base stations, setting a new standard for motion capture technology. The system includes eight wireless trackers, each weighing a mere 25 grams, designed for easy attachment to any strap. With a battery life of 50 hours, the trackers support up to two days of continuous use on a single USB-C charge, featuring customizable RGB lighting and a built-in haptic module for an immersive experience.</p><p>Compatibility with SteamVR and OpenXR, along with one-step auto-calibration, makes the EXCAP system versatile for use in popular virtual environments such as VRChat. Priced at $359, the complete set is available for purchase directly from <a href='https://shop.elecholic.tech' rel='nofollow' target='_blank'>shop.elecholic.tech</a>, including free worldwide shipping. This development is poised to democratize high-quality motion capture technology, enabling creators and developers to push the boundaries of virtual reality experiences.</p>
