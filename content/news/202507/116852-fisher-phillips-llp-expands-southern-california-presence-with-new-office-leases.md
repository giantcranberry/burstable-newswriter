<p>Fisher Phillips LLP, a leading international labor and employment law firm, has recently expanded its footprint in Southern California with new office leases in downtown Los Angeles and Woodland Hills. The firm has secured a 35,744-square-foot lease at 515 South Flower Street in Los Angeles and a 13,624-square-foot lease at 21600 Oxnard Street in Woodland Hills. These strategic moves underscore the firm's commitment to the region and its growing demand for specialized legal services.</p><p>Todd Scherwin, Regional Managing Partner at Fisher Phillips, highlighted the importance of these expansions, noting they demonstrate the firm's longstanding presence in Southern California and its focus on client service and talent acquisition. With a team of over 675 attorneys spread across 45 offices in the U.S., Mexico, and Japan, Fisher Phillips is well-positioned to address a wide range of workplace legal challenges, from wage and hour disputes to employment discrimination and workplace safety issues.</p><p>The leasing transactions were managed by JLL's Jim Schoolfield and Kevin Bender, who pointed out the strategic value of the chosen locations for Fisher Phillips' growth. Despite a broader downturn in office leasing activity in Los Angeles, the firm's expansion reflects a selective trend among successful businesses to invest in premium office spaces that support client engagement and employee satisfaction. This development not only reinforces Fisher Phillips' market position but also signals confidence in the resilience and potential of Southern California's legal services sector.</p>
