<p>Goliath Resources Limited has announced a significant high-grade gold discovery at the Bonanza Zone on its Golddigger Property, situated in British Columbia's Golden Triangle. The discovery, highlighted by drill hole GD-24-280 which returned 8.31 g/t Au over 23 meters, including higher-grade intervals, represents the third distinct mineralized rock package identified at Surebet. With visible gold found in 60 out of 64 holes drilled in 2024, the potential for further expansion of the Surebet Discovery is considerable. A 60,000-meter drill program is currently in progress to explore this potential further.</p><p>McEwen Mining Inc., which holds a strategic equity interest in Goliath Resources, is positioned to benefit from this discovery. The ongoing exploration efforts are not only focused on expanding the known mineralization both laterally and at depth but also on targeting a deep-seated magmatic gold source, known as the 'Motherlode'. This development underscores the increasing discovery potential of the Golddigger Property and its importance for stakeholders, including McEwen Mining.</p><p>For more information on the discovery and its implications, visit <a href='https://ibn.fm/YocsI' rel='nofollow' target='_blank'>https://ibn.fm/YocsI</a>.</p>
