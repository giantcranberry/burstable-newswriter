<p>SBC Medical Group Holdings Inc. has marked a significant achievement by being added to the Russell 3000 Index, a development that not only boosts its visibility among investors but also highlights its escalating importance in the global economy. Effective from June 30, 2025, this inclusion automatically positions SBC Medical Group within either the Russell 1000 or Russell 2000 Index, in addition to relevant growth and value style indexes. Given that the Russell indexes, overseen by FTSE Russell, play a crucial role in investment strategies with around $18.1 trillion in assets benchmarked against them globally, this milestone underscores the company's robust performance and the surging demand for cosmetic surgery services worldwide.</p><p>The company's financial health is evident from its reported 5% year-over-year increase in earnings per share to $0.21 and a rise in EBITDA margins to 52% for the first quarter of 2025. Operating 251 clinics globally and boasting a strong customer retention rate, SBC Medical Group is effectively leveraging the expanding aesthetic medical market. This strategic positioning is further bolstered by the appointment of Shinya Inoue as the new Chief Marketing Officer. Inoue's vast experience in brand strategy and digital marketing, garnered from previous roles at Pioneer Corporation, P&G Japan, Eli Lilly Japan, Adobe, and KDDI, is anticipated to propel the company's global expansion and enhance its brand value.</p><p>These strategic initiatives by SBC Medical Group, including its index inclusion and the strengthening of its leadership team, reflect its dedication to fostering growth and innovation in the competitive cosmetic surgery industry. As the company continues to broaden its global presence, these developments are expected to draw more investors and solidify its standing in the market.</p>
