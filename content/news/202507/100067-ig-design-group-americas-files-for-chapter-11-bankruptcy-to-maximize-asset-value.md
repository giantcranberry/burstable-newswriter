<p>IG Design Group Americas, Inc. and its domestic subsidiaries have initiated a voluntary chapter 11 bankruptcy filing in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas. This strategic decision is designed to oversee a marketing and sale process under section 363 of the Bankruptcy Code, with the objective of maximizing the value of the company's assets. The initiative includes engaging potential buyers for specific business segments while discontinuing its domestically manufactured woven ribbon products operations.</p><p>The filing is a response to a prolonged period of operational challenges, further complicated by the liquidation of a key customer and the anticipated effects of new trade tariffs set to take effect in 2025. These developments have adversely influenced DGA's revenue streams, operational expenses, and customer demand. Sue Buchta, Chief Executive Officer of DGA, has reiterated the company's dedication to reducing the repercussions for its employees, customers, and partners throughout this transitional phase.</p><p>To support its strategy during the chapter 11 proceedings, DGA has arranged for approximately $53 million in debtor-in-possession financing from an affiliate of Hilco Capital Group, subject to court approval. The company has also submitted standard 'first day' motions to maintain employee wages and benefits, among other necessary measures. It's important to note that DGA's non-U.S. affiliates are not part of the chapter 11 filings and will continue their normal operations.</p><p>For further information on the court-supervised process, details can be found at <a href='https://cases.ra.kroll.com/DGA' rel='nofollow' target='_blank'>https://cases.ra.kroll.com/DGA</a>. DGA is receiving guidance from Latham & Watkins LLP as legal counsel, Huron Consulting Group LLC as financial advisor and investment banker, and C Street Advisory Group as strategic communications advisor.</p>
