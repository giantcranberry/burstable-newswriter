<p>Lantern Pharma (NASDAQ: LTRN) has introduced a groundbreaking AI-powered module within its RADR(R) platform, aimed at enhancing the prediction of combination therapies' efficacy involving DNA-damaging agents (DDAs) and DNA damage response inhibitors (DDRis). This development is backed by a comprehensive analysis of 221 clinical trials, providing a biomarker-guided strategy for cancer treatment design. The innovation is poised to reduce oncology drug development time and costs by up to one-third, representing a notable leap forward in the field.</p><p>The efficacy of Lantern Pharma's new module was showcased in the design of a Phase 1B/2 trial for triple-negative breast cancer, combining LP-184 and olaparib, which has received FDA clearance. The company is now looking to license and commercialize this technology across various oncology indications, aiming to extend its benefits to a wider range of cancer treatments. The RADR(R) platform, which harnesses over 200 billion oncology-focused data points and more than 200 advanced machine learning algorithms, has already proven its worth by accelerating Lantern Pharma's drug pipeline development. Programs have moved from initial AI insights to clinical trials in just 2-3 years, with an approximate cost of $2.5 million per program.</p><p>This advancement underscores the transformative potential of AI in streamlining and reducing the cost of drug development, especially in the intricate domain of oncology. Lantern Pharma's innovative approach sets a new benchmark for the efficient and cost-effective development of targeted cancer therapies, offering hope for faster and more affordable treatment options for patients worldwide.</p>
