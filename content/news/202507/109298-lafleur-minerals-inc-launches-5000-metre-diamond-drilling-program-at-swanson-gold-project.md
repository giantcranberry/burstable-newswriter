<p>LaFleur Minerals Inc. has initiated a fully funded 5,000-metre diamond drilling program at its Swanson Gold Project in Québec, marking a pivotal step in the company's gold exploration and development strategy. This program, now underway following the acquisition of necessary permits, is designed to evaluate the project's viability and progress towards production, showcasing LaFleur's dedication to advancing its mining interests.</p><p>Alongside the drilling initiative, LaFleur Minerals has disclosed the results of an independent valuation of its Beacon Gold Mill, which underscores the facility's excellent condition and strategic importance. With an estimated restart cost of C$4.1 million against a replacement value surpassing C$71.5 million, the mill represents a significant asset, positioning LaFleur as a junior miner with both a promising gold project and a fully permitted mill in a prime mining location.</p><p>The company has further expanded its Swanson land package to over 18,300 hectares, reinforcing its foothold in the Abitibi Gold Belt. This expansion, combined with the Beacon Gold Mill's advantages, bolsters LaFleur's capacity to generate enduring value for its stakeholders. The Swanson Gold Project's accessibility via road and rail enhances its development prospects, making it a cornerstone of LaFleur's portfolio.</p><p>For additional details on LaFleur Minerals Inc. and its endeavors, visit <a href='https://ibn.fm/I2NF7' rel='nofollow' target='_blank'>https://ibn.fm/I2NF7</a>.</p>
