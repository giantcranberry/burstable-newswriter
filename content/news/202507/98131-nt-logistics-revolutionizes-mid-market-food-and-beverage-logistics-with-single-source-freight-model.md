<p>NT Logistics, a Texas-based third-party logistics provider, is setting a new standard for mid-market food and beverage companies with its single-source freight model. This model combines execution, analytics, and strategic insight to provide a transparent overview of logistics spend and performance, empowering companies to make swift, informed decisions. Lynn Gravley, President and CEO of NT Logistics, emphasizes the company's dedication to transparency and efficiency, which enables customers to identify cost drivers and implement cost-reduction strategies effectively.</p><p>The cornerstone of NT Logistics' strategy is its proprietary platform, NTelligence, which offers real-time dashboards and detailed insights into logistics operations. This technology has proven instrumental in achieving measurable improvements, such as a 6% reduction in deliveries and a 1% increase in weight per pallet for one client, through careful network redesign and optimization. NTelligence's ability to track costs down to the smallest detail supports informed decision-making on accessorials, route density, and pallet utilization, while also ensuring service reliability.</p><p>Recognizing the unique challenges of the food and beverage industry, particularly the importance of product freshness and shelf life, NT Logistics prioritizes minimizing transit times and quickly resolving exceptions. This approach has yielded substantial savings for clients, including a refrigerated food brand that realized six-figure savings by optimizing inbound logistics. Gravley articulates the company's customer-first philosophy, highlighting a commitment to building smarter networks and reducing costs, even at the expense of revenue, to ensure long-term customer success.
