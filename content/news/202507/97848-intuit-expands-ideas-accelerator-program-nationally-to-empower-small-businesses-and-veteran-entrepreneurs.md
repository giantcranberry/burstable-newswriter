<p>Intuit Inc., renowned for its financial technology solutions such as TurboTax and QuickBooks, has announced the national expansion of its IDEAS accelerator program. This initiative, in collaboration with the National Urban League, is set to accept applications from small business owners in nine U.S. cities and a special nationwide cohort for veterans and military spouse entrepreneurs. The program's expansion follows its successful pilot in Los Angeles, Atlanta, and Philadelphia, where participants saw an average revenue increase of 23% and saved 16.5 hours monthly through the use of Intuit's AI-driven products and coaching from the National Urban League and Zella Life.</p><p>David Graham, Intuit's Senior Vice President of Customer Success, remarked on the program's effectiveness in elevating small businesses to new levels. The expanded program aims to assist an additional 250 entrepreneurs in cities including Charlotte, Chicago, and New York City, alongside a dedicated group for military veterans and their spouses. Marc H. Morial of the National Urban League pointed out the program's significance in tackling common small business hurdles like funding and capital access, combining Intuit's technological prowess with the League's extensive experience in small business support.</p><p>Participants of the IDEAS program will enjoy free access to Intuit's suite of financial tools, including TurboTax and QuickBooks, alongside business coaching, technology grants for hardware, and a cash grant upon completing the 12-month program. Emilio Daniel Vasquez, founder of Coffee Cart Boys and a program alumnus, credits the initiative with transforming his business approach and overcoming personal challenges to achieve growth. Applications for the IDEAS program are open until July 21, 2025, inviting entrepreneurs from the selected cities and veteran or military spouse entrepreneurs across the country to apply.</p>
