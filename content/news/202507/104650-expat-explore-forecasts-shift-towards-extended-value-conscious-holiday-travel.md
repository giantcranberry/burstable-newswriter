<p>Expat Explore, a leading group tour operator, has identified a significant shift in holiday travel trends for the 2025-26 season, with travelers increasingly opting for extended experiences and value-conscious planning. The company highlights a surge in shoulder season travel, with a notable preference for destinations offering summer weather during the traditional winter break. This trend reflects a broader desire among travelers for longer, more meaningful trips that combine warmth with cultural richness.</p><p>Carl Cronje, co-founder of Expat Explore, underscores the move towards smarter travel choices, with destinations such as South Africa and Morocco gaining popularity for their ability to offer escape from the winter chill. The company has curated specific tours like the <a href='https://www.expatexplore.com' rel='nofollow' target='_blank'>South Africa Escape Tour</a>, <a href='https://www.expatexplore.com' rel='nofollow' target='_blank'>Highlights of Morocco Tour</a>, and the <a href='https://www.expatexplore.com' rel='nofollow' target='_blank'>Cape Town and Garden Route Tour</a> to meet this demand, focusing on sunshine and cultural immersion.</p><p>Jakes Maritz, another co-founder, notes the rising trend of gifting travel experiences, which requires careful consideration of seasonal preferences and opportunities for cultural engagement. Expat Explore's holiday offerings, including traditional Christmas tours across Europe and the UK, are designed to provide hassle-free, meaningful exploration. This approach is further supported by their 20th Anniversary Birthday Sale, aiming to make these experiences more accessible to a wider audience.</p><p>The implications of these trends are significant for the travel industry, indicating a shift towards more thoughtful, experience-driven travel. For business and technology leaders, understanding these preferences can inform strategies in tourism marketing, customer experience, and digital platforms that cater to the evolving demands of modern travelers.</p>
