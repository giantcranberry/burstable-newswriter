<p>SolarBank Corporation has achieved a significant milestone with the completion of the Coordinated Electric System Interconnection Review (CESIR) for its 7.2-megawatt Hoadley Hill Road solar project in upstate New York. This development is a crucial step towards the project's interconnection with the local grid, facilitating the advancement of renewable energy sources in the region.</p><p>The Hoadley Hill project, envisioned as a community solar initiative, is set to generate enough electricity to power approximately 850 homes. It offers local residents the chance to subscribe and receive credits on their utility bills, thereby enhancing the accessibility and affordability of renewable energy. The project is poised to benefit from New York's Value of Distributed Energy Resources (VDER) compensation system, with an anticipated year-one compensation rate of US$0.0971 per kWh.</p><p>With the CESIR process now complete, SolarBank is moving forward with the final stages of permitting and financing for the Hoadley Hill solar project. This initiative not only supports New York's renewable energy objectives but also highlights the increasing role of community solar projects in the shift towards sustainable energy solutions.
