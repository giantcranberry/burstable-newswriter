<p>The US Budget Act, recently passed and known as President Donald Trump's Big Beautiful Bill, has officially ended federal tax incentives for electric vehicle (EV) buyers, a decision that accelerates the original timeline set to phase out these credits by 2025. This move highlights the administration's continued efforts to reverse climate action-related policies from the Biden era, with the cessation of incentives taking effect on September 30th. The implications of this policy change are significant for the EV market and companies such as Massimo Group (NASDAQ: MAMO), which may now face the challenge of reassessing their strategies in response to the evolving policy environment.</p><p>The removal of EV tax credits marks a critical shift that could alter consumer behavior and hinder the automotive industry's transition towards more sustainable alternatives. The absence of financial incentives may reduce the attractiveness of electric vehicles for certain buyers, potentially decelerating the rate of EV adoption across the United States. This policy reversal is especially notable as it diverges sharply from previous initiatives designed to promote the adoption of environmentally friendly transportation solutions.
