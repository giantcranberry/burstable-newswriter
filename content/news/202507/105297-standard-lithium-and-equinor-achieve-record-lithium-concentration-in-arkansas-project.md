<p>Standard Lithium Ltd. (NYSE American: SLI), in partnership with Equinor through their joint venture Smackover Lithium, has reported a groundbreaking achievement at their South West Arkansas (SWA) Project. Sampling from the Lester well uncovered the highest lithium concentration to date at 616 mg/L, with an average of 582 mg/L across three samples, marking the conclusion of Phase 1 sub-surface exploration activities.</p><p>The joint venture is now progressing with its Front-End Engineering Design (FEED) study, aiming for a Definitive Feasibility Study by the third quarter of 2025. A Final Investment Decision is anticipated by the end of that year. This development is a pivotal step towards the sustainable, commercial-scale production of lithium, leveraging a scalable and fully integrated direct lithium extraction (DLE) and purification process.</p><p>The SWA Project is situated in the Smackover Formation, a globally recognized lithium-brine asset. The collaboration between Standard Lithium and Equinor underscores the potential for greenfield lithium-brine projects in Arkansas and Texas, addressing the escalating demand for lithium in sectors such as electric vehicles and renewable energy storage solutions.</p>
