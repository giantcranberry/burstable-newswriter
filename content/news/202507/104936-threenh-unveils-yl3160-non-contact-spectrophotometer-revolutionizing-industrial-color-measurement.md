<p>The industrial sector's relentless pursuit of automation and quality control has been significantly advanced with the introduction of the YL3160 Non-Contact Spectrophotometer by ThreeNH. This state-of-the-art device is engineered to overcome the challenges posed by traditional contact-based color measurement methods, such as the risk of sample contamination and damage, by utilizing a non-contact, omnidirectional sensor. This innovation ensures real-time color consistency and reliability, marking a pivotal development in industrial production processes.</p><p>Designed for seamless integration with industrial production lines and robotic systems, the YL3160 facilitates automated, non-invasive color monitoring. Its advanced features include a 256-Pixel Dual-Array CMOS Image Sensor for capturing high-precision spectral data, a UV and Full-Spectrum LED Light Source that ensures broad color rendition, and an IP66 protective rating, making it durable enough to withstand harsh industrial environments. With the capability to perform over one million measurements in 24 hours, the YL3160 redefines the benchmarks for speed and accuracy in color measurement technology.</p><p>The non-contact measurement approach offers substantial benefits, notably in preserving sample integrity and preventing cross-contamination. This makes the YL3160 particularly suitable for industries with stringent hygiene requirements, such as cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, and food processing. Furthermore, its versatility allows for precise color measurement across a diverse range of materials, including solids, liquids, powders, and surfaces with irregular geometries.</p><p>An executive from ThreeNH emphasized the device's role in meeting contemporary industrial needs, stating, 'Our vision was to create a measurement solution that leads the way.' The launch of the YL3160 is a significant milestone in the evolution of automated quality control, aiding manufacturers in their journey towards Industry 4.0 by reducing human error and boosting production efficiency.</p><p>Globally available as of July 2025, the YL3160 can be procured through ThreeNH's <a href='https://www.threenh.com' rel='nofollow' target='_blank'>official website</a> or via authorized distributors. ThreeNH is committed to providing extensive support for the YL3160, including a standard 1-year warranty, options for extended services, and customization to cater to specific industrial requirements.</p>
