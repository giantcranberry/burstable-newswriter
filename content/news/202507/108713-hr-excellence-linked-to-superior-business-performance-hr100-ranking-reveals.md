<p>The latest HR100 ranking by HRO Today has brought to light the undeniable connection between human resources excellence and business success. Companies that have secured positions in the top 25 of the ranking boast a median EBITDA per employee of $152,000, starkly contrasting with the $99,626 reported by those in the bottom 25. This 41.6% disparity underscores the financial impact of superior HR strategies.</p><p>Moreover, the average two-year revenue growth for the highest-ranked companies was recorded at 12.0%, compared to a modest 9.0% for those at the lower end of the ranking. This 28.6% difference not only highlights the role of strategic HR practices in driving business growth but also sets a benchmark for organizations aiming to enhance their performance. The significance of these findings is amplified when considering that Fortune 500 companies saw a 6% revenue increase from 2024 to 2025, a rate that is only half of what the top HR100 performers achieved.</p><p>The HR100 ranking's methodology is thorough, analyzing nearly 1,000 companies based on data from 55 benchmarking and ranking programs. This approach ensures a comprehensive evaluation that balances external recognition with internal HR achievements.
