<p>Farmer Focus, a Harrisonburg, Va.-based company, has recently closed a $7 million funding round, marking a significant milestone in its mission to revolutionize the poultry industry through humane farming practices. This investment is part of a broader financial strategy that includes previous funding of $27.8 million and a $3.6 million grant from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, aimed at expanding the company's innovative farming model.</p><p>The company's approach is distinctive in its emphasis on farmer empowerment and sustainability. By allowing farmers to own their flocks, Farmer Focus ensures fair compensation and reduces the competitive pressures typical in traditional farming contracts. This model not only supports small family farmers but also tackles pressing issues such as farmer debt and environmental sustainability. CEO Stephen Shepard has pointed out the rapid decline of small family farms, highlighting the critical role of Farmer Focus in revitalizing this essential sector.</p><p>With its products now available in over 4,000 stores across the East Coast and Midwest, including major retailers like Publix and Kroger, Farmer Focus is making significant inroads into the market. The company's achievements have not gone unnoticed, earning it a place on Fast Company's 2022 World Changing Ideas list and several industry awards. Furthermore, with a waitlist of over 100 farmers eager to adopt its model, Farmer Focus is at the forefront of transforming the poultry industry into a more sustainable and humane enterprise.</p><p>The implications of Farmer Focus's growth extend beyond the immediate benefits to farmers and the environment. This development signals a growing consumer demand for ethically produced food and a shift in industry standards towards more sustainable and humane practices. For business and technology leaders, Farmer Focus's success story offers valuable insights into the potential of innovative business models to address complex societal and environmental challenges.</p>
