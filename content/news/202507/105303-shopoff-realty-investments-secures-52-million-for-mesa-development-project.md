<p>Shopoff Realty Investments has announced a major financial milestone with the securing of $52 million in financing from Peachtree Group for The Block at Elliot project in Mesa, Arizona. This development encompasses around 270 acres of undeveloped land, with the financing aimed at advancing the project to its next phase, covering essential costs such as grading, offsite street, and utility improvements.</p><p>William A. Shopoff, President and CEO of Shopoff Realty Investments, emphasized the significance of this financing achievement, especially in the context of the current financial climate and market uncertainties. The refinancing arrangement with Peachtree Group is seen as a crucial enabler for the project's progression, reflecting confidence in the project's potential and the broader real estate market's resilience.</p><p>Since its acquisition in 2022, Shopoff has made notable progress with The Block at Elliot, including the successful annexation of the project into Mesa and obtaining city approval for a mass grading plan. The firm is currently working closely with Mesa officials to finalize the development plan and product mix, with grading operations anticipated to commence in late 2025.</p><p>The financing deal was facilitated by Mark Strauss and Rob Quarton of Walker & Dunlop, who played instrumental roles in navigating the complexities of the deal's capital stack. Strauss expressed pride in their contribution to the loan's successful closing and looked forward to the project's continued advancement, underscoring the collaborative effort behind this significant real estate development.</p>
