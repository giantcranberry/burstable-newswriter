<p>Image Protect, Inc. (OTC: IMTL) has recently shared an update on its strategic direction and revenue goals, spotlighting its InterceptCS™ Cold Sore Prevention System. This product, developed under its subsidiary Global Wellness Products, has received Class II Medical Device approval from Health Canada, positioning it as a pioneering solution in the wellness technology sector. The global cold sore market, valued at over $3.5 billion, offers a fertile ground for InterceptCS™, with the U.S. and Canadian markets alone accounting for $1.2 billion and $150 million, respectively.</p><p>The company's strategy to tap into this lucrative market involves a multi-channel sales approach, including direct-to-consumer ecommerce and partnerships with major online retailers like Amazon, Walmart.com, and eBay. Targeting key international markets such as the UK, Australia, and the EU, Image Protect aims to achieve up to $100 million in annual revenue within five years. Central to this revenue model are the sales of the InterceptCS™ device and the recurring purchases of thermal activators, with each user potentially contributing around $200 annually.</p><p>To drive brand awareness and customer acquisition, Global Wellness Products is deploying an extensive marketing campaign. This initiative includes social media advertising, search engine marketing, and collaborations with influencers, all designed to highlight the product's unique focus on prevention rather than symptom treatment. CEO Frank Casella underscored the product's market differentiation and ongoing enhancements aimed at increasing consumer value and profitability.</p><p>Despite the optimistic outlook, Image Protect acknowledges the inherent risks and uncertainties in forward-looking statements, noting that actual results may differ. The company is dedicated to establishing InterceptCS™ as a leading brand in personal wellness, supported by regulatory approvals and a strong ecommerce framework.</p>
