<p>UGI Utilities, Inc. has revealed plans for a significant infrastructure upgrade in Quakertown, with a natural gas main replacement project scheduled to commence on August 1, 2025. This initiative is part of UGI's ongoing commitment to maintaining the safety and reliability of its natural gas distribution network. The project, focusing on Rich Hill Road between Whaland Road and Masi Drive, is expected to wrap up by mid-September, though the timeline could be influenced by weather and other operational factors.</p><p>Residents and businesses in the affected area should prepare for potential disruptions, including road closures, detours, and parking limitations, as construction will take place on weekdays from 7:00am to 5:00pm. UGI has also warned of possible temporary interruptions to natural gas service, which will require property access for necessary inspections and relighting procedures. Following the underground work, final paving and restoration efforts will be undertaken to minimize long-term impacts on the community.</p><p>An added benefit of this project is the opportunity for eligible properties along the route to convert to natural gas service. UGI is encouraging interested parties to inquire about the conversion process, which could offer long-term energy savings and environmental benefits.
