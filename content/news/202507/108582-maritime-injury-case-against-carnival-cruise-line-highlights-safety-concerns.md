<p>The Brais Law Firm has initiated legal proceedings on behalf of Hannah Smith, a 22-year-old summa cum laude graduate from Miles College, who suffered severe injuries during a shore excursion in Nassau, Bahamas. The incident, which took place on May 12, 2025, involved Smith being drawn into the propellers of a catamaran during Carnival Cruise Line's 'Pearl Island Beach Escape with Lunch,' resulting in multiple emergency surgeries and the amputation of her right leg at the hip.</p><p>Specializing in maritime personal injury cases, the Brais Law Firm is preparing to file a lawsuit against Carnival Corporation, Pearl Investment Management Group, Ltd., and Sun Cay Ltd. The lawsuit will allege direct negligence by Carnival for not ensuring the safety of the excursion and vicarious liability for the actions of the excursion operators. These operators are accused of violating industry safety standards by allowing passengers to disembark while the vessel's engines were active.</p><p>Carnival Cruise Line is anticipated to contest liability, claiming the excursion operators were independent contractors and that it had no control or awareness of unsafe practices. The Brais Law Firm plans to counter these defenses by emphasizing Carnival's involvement in marketing and selling the excursion, which they argue creates apparent agency under maritime law.</p><p>This legal battle brings to light the paramount importance of adhering to safety standards in maritime excursions and the potential legal consequences for cruise lines and their partners when these standards are neglected.
