These offerings are specifically crafted to boost partners' growth, allowing them to offer significant value to their clients efficiently. A key aspect of the program is its exclusivity to partners, ensuring MSPs and MSSPs can broaden their market presence without encountering channel conflicts.</p><p>David Primor, Ph.D., Co-founder and CEO of Cynomi, emphasized the program's role as a catalyst for partner growth. 'ELEVATE is engineered to not only expand our partners' cybersecurity services but also to distinguish their offerings and create new revenue opportunities quickly and confidently,' Primor explained.
