<p>OvareGroup has announced a significant restructuring by consolidating its agency brands under the new banner of TogetherWith, moving away from the traditional holding-company model. This consolidation brings together the specialized expertise of agencies such as AdCucina, &Well, and PowerScoppechio into a single entity, with creative hubs strategically located in Louisville, Miami, and Buenos Aires. Santiago Puiggari, a founding partner of TogetherWith, emphasized the transition from a strategic partnership to a unified team, highlighting a shared vision for the future of creativity in the advertising industry.</p><p>The new model introduced by TogetherWith is designed to thrive on the creative tension generated by diverse markets and perspectives. Heidi Singleton, the Chief Creative Officer, pointed out that the contrast between cities, languages, and viewpoints is a fertile ground for generating the best ideas. This innovative approach has already shown promising results, benefiting a prestigious roster of clients including KFC, GE Appliances, and Dell, among others.</p><p>TogetherWith is not stopping at consolidation; the agency has ambitious plans to expand its Louisville team through new hires and is set to unveil a comprehensive brand identity in the near future.
