<p>Metavesco, Inc. (OTC: MVCO) has recently upgraded its Bitcoin mining operations by integrating Bitmain Antminer S21+ units, increasing its hashing capacity to approximately 26 petahash per second (PH/s). This 30% enhancement over its previous setup enables the company to produce Bitcoin at an all-in mining cost of around $55,000 per Bitcoin, significantly below the current spot price of approximately $118,000.</p><p>Ryan Schadel, President & CEO of Metavesco, emphasized the strategic importance of this upgrade, noting the company's ability to 'print future balance-sheet strength at half the market cost with these new miners.' This approach allows Metavesco to accumulate Bitcoin without diluting shareholder value, addressing a common industry challenge and showcasing the company's operational efficiency.</p><p>The upgrade not only increases Metavesco's daily Bitcoin production to approximately 0.0124 BTC, enabling the addition of roughly 1 BTC every 80 days but also strengthens its position in the competitive Bitcoin mining sector. This development is timely, as over 250 public and private organizations now recognize Bitcoin as a viable corporate reserve asset, highlighting the growing integration of cryptocurrency into mainstream financial strategies.</p><p>Metavesco's strategic move reflects a wider trend of companies adopting cryptocurrency to bolster financial resilience and growth. By optimizing its mining operations, Metavesco not only gains a competitive advantage but also contributes to the broader acceptance and utility of Bitcoin in corporate treasury management.</p>
