<p>UGI Utilities has unveiled plans for significant system upgrades in Bethlehem, set to commence on July 9, as part of its commitment to maintaining safe and reliable service. The project focuses on the replacement of a gas main, impacting West Graham Place, Vine Street, and Rink Street, with construction hours from 7am to 5pm, Monday through Friday, targeting completion by early August, subject to weather-related delays.</p><p>The initiative will necessitate parking restrictions and may lead to temporary interruptions in natural gas service. UGI emphasizes the importance of property access for inspecting and relighting equipment during this period. Additionally, the company sees this as a pivotal moment for homes and businesses along the affected routes to consider transitioning to natural gas, highlighting the advantages of such a move.</p><p>While UGI encourages those interested in converting to natural gas to reach out, the primary objective remains the swift and efficient execution of the upgrades to reduce community disruption.
