<p>In light of recent federal funding cuts to public media, Nail Communications has introduced a campaign designed to celebrate and bolster regional public radio. This initiative involves the distribution of free NPAH bumper stickers, aiming to shed light on the pivotal role local public media plays in providing journalism, storytelling, and entertainment to communities nationwide.</p><p>Alec Beckett, Creative Partner at Nail Communications, highlighted the significance of public media as a foundational element of the journalism ecosystem, which is currently encountering significant challenges. The bumper stickers, obtainable at <a href='https://www.NPAH.org' rel='nofollow' target='_blank'>www.NPAH.org</a>, act as a symbol of the distinct value that local public media institutions offer to their communities, differentiating them from the generalized view of public media as a single entity.</p><p>This campaign also showcases a sense of regional pride in New England, where public radio is fondly known as 'NPAH'. It reinforces the core objective of public media to 'Tell the truth and tell it well,' a principle previously emphasized in Nail Communications' collaboration with WBUR. This movement not only raises awareness but also fosters community support for public media at a time when it is most needed.</p>
