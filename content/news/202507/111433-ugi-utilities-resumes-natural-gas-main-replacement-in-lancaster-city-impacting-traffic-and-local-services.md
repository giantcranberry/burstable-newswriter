<p>UGI Utilities, Inc. has announced the resumption of a significant natural gas main replacement project in Lancaster City, with work set to begin on July 21, 2025. This project, which includes areas around Penn Medicine Lancaster General Hospital, is a critical part of UGI's commitment to providing safe and reliable service to its customers. The initiative is expected to wrap up by the end of September, offering some homes and businesses along the route the opportunity to convert to natural gas, thereby modernizing the local energy infrastructure.</p><p>The construction will notably impact traffic on North Duke Street between East Clay Street and East Chestnut Street, and East Frederick Street between North Christian Street and North Duke Street. Operating hours are scheduled from Monday to Friday, 7am to 5pm, during which road closures, detours, and parking restrictions may cause delays for drivers and disruptions for local residents and business owners. Additionally, UGI will temporarily suspend natural gas service in the affected areas, requiring property access for equipment inspection and relighting purposes.</p><p>The project's completion is dependent on weather and working conditions, with final paving and restoration activities planned after the underground work is finished. UGI is also using this opportunity to encourage interested parties to consider converting to natural gas, emphasizing the project's focus on both infrastructure improvement and enhancing customer service.
