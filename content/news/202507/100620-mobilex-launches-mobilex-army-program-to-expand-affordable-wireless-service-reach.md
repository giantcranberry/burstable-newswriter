<p>MobileX has unveiled the MobileX Army program, a strategic initiative aimed at broadening the adoption of its cost-effective wireless service through customer referrals. This program offers participants a 10% commission on the monthly plan cost of each new customer they recruit, with extra incentives for those who switch from other carriers to MobileX's Unlimited or customized plans featuring at least 3GB of data alongside unlimited talk and text.</p><p>Peter Adderton, the founder and CEO of MobileX, highlighted the significance of word-of-marketing in today's digital age and how the MobileX Army program capitalizes on this by financially rewarding users for their referral efforts. Ambassadors can join the program via the MobileX app or website, where they are provided with a unique QR code to share with potential recruits. Commissions are activated once the new customer pays for the service, with earnings distributed monthly through direct deposit or PayPal.</p><p>This initiative is a cornerstone of MobileX's ambition to disrupt the conventional wireless service industry by offering plans tailored to individual usage patterns, powered by AI. The MobileX Army program not only enables users to earn additional income but also plays a pivotal role in driving the uptake of more affordable and adaptable wireless solutions, marking a significant step forward in the evolution of mobile service offerings.</p>
