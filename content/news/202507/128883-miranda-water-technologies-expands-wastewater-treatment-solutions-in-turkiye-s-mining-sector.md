<p>Miranda Water Technologies, a subsidiary of Rainmaker Worldwide Inc., has successfully installed a second Miracell® Essential wastewater treatment system at Gubretas Mining in Turkiye, following the first system's deployment in 2022. This development highlights the increasing need for efficient and sustainable wastewater management solutions in the mining sector, particularly in remote and challenging environments.</p><p>The Miracell® Essential system is specifically designed to support over 500 day workers, featuring scalable, rapidly deployable solutions that excel in the harsh conditions of mining operations. Its containerized Rotating Biological Contactor (RBC) technology stands out for its low power consumption, minimal operational requirements, and quick mobilization capabilities. These attributes are essential for mining operations that prioritize environmental compliance, operational efficiency, and cost-effectiveness.</p><p>With a track record of over 1,200 installations in more than 40 countries, Miranda's Miracell® systems have proven their reliability and effectiveness in demanding industrial settings. The decision by Gubretas Mining to install a second system at the same location is a testament to the product's performance and Miranda Water Technologies' dedication to providing scalable, high-performance wastewater treatment solutions.</p><p>Michael O’Connor, Chairman and CEO of Rainmaker Worldwide Inc., commented on the project's significance, noting, 'The continued trust from our client and the consistent performance of the original system made the decision to move forward with a second installation clear.' This initiative is in line with Rainmaker's broader strategy to offer modular infrastructure solutions that address the challenges of rapid development, environmental compliance, and decentralized service delivery in various industrial sectors.</p><p>For further details on Miranda Water Technologies and their innovative wastewater treatment solutions, visit <a href='https://www.mirandawater.com' rel='nofollow' target='_blank'>https://www.mirandawater.com</a>.
