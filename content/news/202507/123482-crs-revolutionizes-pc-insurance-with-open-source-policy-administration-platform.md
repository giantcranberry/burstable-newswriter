<p>Combined Ratio Solutions (CRS), a Hartford-based InsurTech firm, is transforming the property and casualty (P&C) insurance industry with its innovative, open-source policy administration platform, CRS OSPolicy. Founded in 2018 by industry veterans Michael Jones and Luke Magnan, CRS addresses the sector's reliance on outdated, costly systems by offering a solution that insurers can own, modify, and deploy on their preferred infrastructure, effectively eliminating vendor lock-in.</p><p>Michael Jones, leveraging over two decades of insurance experience, has steered CRS towards prioritizing long-term value and intellectual property ownership over traditional licensing models. This approach has distinguished CRS in a conservative industry, particularly among tier-2 and tier-3 insurers, by equipping them with the technological capabilities to rival larger competitors. CRS's global presence, with offices in Uruguay, Argentina, Serbia, and Georgia, enables it to harness diverse talent for continuous innovation.</p><p>CRS's journey from a bootstrapped startup to a profitable entity, even amidst challenges like the COVID-19 pandemic and geopolitical uncertainties, underscores its resilient business model and effective cross-cultural operations. Although CRS does not directly develop AI technologies, its platform lays the groundwork for insurers to adopt advanced digital solutions, positioning CRS as a pivotal player in the insurance sector's digital transformation.</p><p>The emergence of CRS and its open-source platform, CRS OSPolicy, exemplifies the potential of challenging conventional industry practices and democratizing technology access in insurance.
