<p>The recent investment by Cybernetix Ventures into Corsha represents a significant advancement in the security of machine-to-machine (M2M) communications, particularly in the fields of robotics and industrial autonomous systems. Corsha, the first Machine Identity Provider (mIDP) focused on securing M2M communications, is now better positioned to protect machine connections in these vital sectors. This move addresses a critical gap in cybersecurity: the safeguarding of machines and operational technology (OT) as industrial systems grow more autonomous and interconnected.</p><p>With support from Cybernetix Ventures, Corsha aims to fast-track the implementation of its patented machine identity platform. This technology ensures that every machine connection is continuously verified and authorized, marking a significant leap in securing manufacturing APIs and protocols. It also establishes continuous verification as a cornerstone of zero-trust security models for cloud, edge, and hybrid environments. This investment is particularly timely, given the rapid transformation of the industrial sector through robotics, automation, and physical AI, which demands a robust identity infrastructure designed specifically for machines.</p><p>Anusha Iyer, CEO and Founder of Corsha, highlighted the transformative role of robotics and automation in industrial operations and the necessity for a machine-specific identity infrastructure. The collaboration with Cybernetix Ventures is set to utilize the venture capital firm's resources and network to expand Corsha's platform, thereby securing the next generation of connected, autonomous systems. Mark Martin, General Partner at Cybernetix Ventures, noted the ongoing threats to robotics and industrial systems and praised Corsha's approach to M2M authentication as a fundamental trust layer for interconnected systems.</p><p>Corsha's platform provides strong, cryptographic identities for every system, dynamic authentication and authorization at each connection, and automated lifecycle management for millions of machine identities, among other capabilities. This investment is part of Corsha's $18 million Series A-1 funding round, which also includes contributions from Sinewave, Razorâ€™s Edge Ventures, Ten Eleven Ventures, and Booz Allen Ventures.
