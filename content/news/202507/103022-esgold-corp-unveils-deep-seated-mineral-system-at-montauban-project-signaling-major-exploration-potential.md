<p>ESGold Corp. (CSE: ESAU) (OTCQB: ESAUF) has recently disclosed findings from its Ambient Noise Tomography (ANT) survey at the Montauban Gold-Silver Project in Quebec, uncovering a mineral system that extends to depths of 1,200 meters. This depth significantly surpasses the areas previously mined, suggesting the presence of a district-scale Volcanogenic Massive Sulphide (VMS) system. Such systems are known for their multiple stacked mineralized lenses, akin to those found in some of the world's most substantial deposits.</p><p>The company is currently integrating the ANT survey data with historical drill results and VTEM data to develop a new 3D geological model for the Montauban project. This model is expected to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the mineral system's extent and potential, guiding future exploration and mining efforts. With all necessary permits already in place and tailings reprocessing underway, ESGold is well-positioned to leverage both immediate production opportunities and the project's long-term exploration prospects.</p><p>This discovery not only highlights the Montauban project's viability as a potential multi-generational mining asset but also its capacity to deliver substantial value to stakeholders and contribute positively to the local economy. The implications of such a find are significant, offering insights into the untapped potential of Quebec's mining sector and reinforcing the importance of advanced exploration technologies in uncovering deep-seated mineral resources.</p><p>For further details on the press release, visit <a href='https://ibn.fm/t4OUz' rel='nofollow' target='_blank'>https://ibn.fm/t4OUz</a>.</p>
