<p>Medsien has recently unveiled its Advanced Primary Care Management (APCM) program, a groundbreaking initiative designed to support healthcare organizations in adapting to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) new care model. This program marks a significant shift in how chronic care is delivered, focusing on a monthly per-patient payment model that diverges from traditional time-based reimbursement systems.</p><p>The APCM program, set to be implemented by CMS in 2025, introduces billing codes G0556, G0557, and G0558. These codes enable providers to classify patients by risk and receive bundled payments for a wide array of services, including Chronic Care Management (CCM), Transitional Care Management (TCM), and Primary Care Management (PCM), alongside virtual visits, telehealth check-ins, and remote evaluations. This approach prioritizes care readiness and continuity, allowing practices to dedicate more resources to patient care rather than administrative duties.</p><p>Distinguishing itself from other solutions, Medsien's APCM program offers a swift and scalable implementation process, capable of making practices operational in just five days. The program boasts several advantages, such as turnkey implementation that eliminates the need for additional staff, seamless Electronic Health Record (EHR) integration for automated documentation, and AI-driven workflows to optimize program operations and compliance. Additionally, it provides a full-service delivery model that encompasses everything from patient identification to personalized outreach, all managed by Medsien's team of dedicated care partners to ensure exceptional service quality.</p><p>Hamed Ahmadi, Co-Founder and CEO of Medsien, emphasized the program's potential to revolutionize healthcare by fostering a relationship-based, proactive care approach. The APCM solution aims to alleviate operational pressures, guarantee compliance, and assist healthcare organizations in effectively navigating the complexities of value-based care.</p><p>This initiative is a testament to Medsien's commitment to advancing healthcare delivery through intelligent systems and a patient-centered design philosophy.
