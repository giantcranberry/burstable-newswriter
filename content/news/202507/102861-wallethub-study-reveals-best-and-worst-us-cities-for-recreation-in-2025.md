<p>A recent WalletHub study has pinpointed Las Vegas, NV, as the top city for recreation in the U.S. in 2025, with Jersey City, NJ, ranking last. This comprehensive analysis, released during National Parks and Recreation Month, sheds light on the critical role of recreational accessibility in fostering health care savings and economic benefits. By evaluating the 100 largest U.S. cities against 47 indicators, including park quality, entertainment facilities, and weather, the study uncovers significant disparities in recreational resources.</p><p>Among the findings, San Francisco and Boston emerged as leaders in walkable park access, offering residents 3.1 times more accessibility than Indianapolis. Las Vegas distinguishes itself with the highest number of playgrounds per capita, surpassing Gilbert, Arizona, by 24.4 times. Buffalo, New York, demonstrates a strong commitment to park investment, spending 11.5 times more per capita than Chula Vista, California. Additionally, San Francisco leads in bike rental facilities per capita, outnumbering Fresno, California, by 39.5 times.</p><p>These rankings not only reflect the varying levels of investment in recreational infrastructure across the country but also underscore the potential implications for public health and urban planning. Cities with higher recreational accessibility may experience lower health care costs and enhanced quality of life, suggesting a need for increased focus on recreational resources in urban development strategies.</p>
