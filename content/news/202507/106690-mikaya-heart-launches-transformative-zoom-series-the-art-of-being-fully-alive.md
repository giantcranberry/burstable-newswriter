<p>Spiritual mentor and shamanic guide Mikaya Heart has introduced a monthly Zoom series titled "The Art of Being Fully Alive," aimed at facilitating deep emotional healing and energetic recalibration. This innovative series, structured in four parts, provides a sacred space for participants to engage in guided sessions and experiential exercises, promoting transformation and self-remembrance. Heart's methodology focuses on the alignment with one's truth to live a life filled with love and light, transcending mere survival to achieve full-spectrum living.</p><p>The series, with a cap of 10 participants per session to ensure personalized attention, includes practices for energy alignment, liberation from obsolete belief systems, and the exploration of personal sovereignty. Each session culminates with a guided visualization led by Heart, designed to integrate healing and activate higher states of consciousness. Priced at $300 for the complete series, with individual sessions available at $85, the program also offers scholarships to ensure accessibility. Heart's philosophy centers on the belief that unimpeded energy flow within the body empowers individuals to connect with their authentic power and manifest from a stance of trust and alignment.</p><p>The community has lauded the course for its profound impact on personal transformation and growth. With enrollment now open for upcoming sessions, potential participants are advised to register promptly due to the limited availability of spots. This series represents a significant step forward in the realm of personal development and spiritual growth, offering tools and insights for those seeking to enhance their emotional and energetic well-being.</p>
