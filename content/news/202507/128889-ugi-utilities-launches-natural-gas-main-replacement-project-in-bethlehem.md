<p>UGI Utilities, Inc. has initiated a natural gas main replacement project in Bethlehem, starting August 4, with completion targeted by the end of October. This project highlights UGI's ongoing commitment to upgrading infrastructure to ensure the safety and reliability of natural gas services for its customers. The work will focus on Mechanic Street, between Hill Street and Steel Avenue, and is expected to impact local traffic patterns and parking availability during construction hours from 7:00am to 5:00pm, Monday through Friday.</p><p>Residents and businesses in the affected area may experience temporary interruptions to their natural gas service as UGI conducts necessary inspections and equipment relighting. The company has also noted that weather conditions could extend the project timeline, with final paving and restoration activities scheduled after the completion of underground work. Despite these inconveniences, the project presents a unique opportunity for some properties along the construction route to convert to natural gas, a cleaner and potentially more cost-effective energy source. Interested parties are encouraged to visit <a href='https://www.ugi.com' rel='nofollow' target='_blank'>www.ugi.com</a> for more information on the conversion process.</p><p>UGI Utilities, Inc., which serves more than 760,000 customers, is dedicated to infrastructure improvements that address the increasing demand for natural gas and electric services. The Bethlehem project exemplifies the company's efforts to modernize its infrastructure and provide high-quality service to the communities it serves.
