<p>Starting July 1, 2025, Florida will enforce a new law that mandates builders to provide a one-year, transferable warranty for newly constructed residential homes, including modular, manufactured, or factory-built units. This warranty, as detailed in Florida Statute §553.837, is designed to cover construction defects in equipment, materials, or workmanship that result in material violations of the Florida Building Code. Builders are obligated to rectify these defects at their own expense, though they have the option to offer an express written warranty that meets or exceeds the statutory requirements.</p><p>The warranty period commences from the date of the original conveyance of title to the initial owner or the date of initial occupancy, whichever occurs first. Notably, the warranty does not cover appliances or equipment under a manufacturer’s warranty, normal wear and tear, settling within accepted trade practices, defects caused by the owner, and damages from natural disasters or acts of God. Additionally, builders are required to restore any work damaged while repairing covered defects.</p><p>This legislative move is aimed at enhancing consumer protection in the housing market, ensuring that new homeowners have a recourse for construction defects. For builders, this means a need to review and possibly revise their warranty practices. They may also need to consider contractual agreements with subcontractors to manage potential indemnity or remediation responsibilities effectively. The law represents a significant shift in the residential construction industry in Florida, with potential ripple effects on how builders operate and how consumers are protected in the housing market.</p>
