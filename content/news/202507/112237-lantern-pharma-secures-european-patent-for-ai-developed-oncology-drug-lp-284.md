<p>Lantern Pharma (NASDAQ: LTRN) has reached a significant milestone with the European Patent Office issuing a notice of allowance for a composition of matter patent for LP-284, its clinical-stage drug candidate targeting relapsed or refractory non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. This patent, set to grant exclusivity through 2039, enhances the drug's global commercialization strategy by complementing existing intellectual property protections in the U.S. and Japan.</p><p>LP-284, developed using Lantern Pharma's RADR(R) AI platform, is currently in Phase 1 clinical trials. The drug has also received Orphan Drug Designations for Mantle Cell Lymphoma (MCL) and High-Grade B-Cell Lymphoma (HGBL), highlighting its potential to meet critical unmet needs in these areas. With a global target market estimated at $4 billion, LP-284 stands as a significant opportunity for Lantern Pharma, bolstered by its rapid development timeline and cost efficiency, making it an attractive candidate for strategic partnerships.</p><p>The RADR(R) platform utilizes over 200 billion oncology-focused data points and more than 200 advanced machine learning algorithms, enabling Lantern Pharma to fast-track its oncology drug pipeline development. This innovative approach has significantly reduced the time and cost of bringing new therapies from initial AI insights to first-in-human clinical trials, averaging 2-3 years and approximately $2.5 million per program.</p><p>This patent approval not only fortifies Lantern Pharma's intellectual property portfolio but also underscores the increasing impact of AI in revolutionizing oncology drug development. By leveraging AI, Lantern Pharma is leading the charge in tackling the complex challenges of cancer treatment, offering new hope to patients with limited therapeutic options.</p>
