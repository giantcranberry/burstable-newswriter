<p>KR New Materials Co., LTD (KR WPC) has launched AluCore™ Decking, a product designed to transform outdoor construction with its unique blend of aesthetic appeal and structural durability. This decking solution integrates a reinforced aluminum core with wood plastic composite, promising to elevate the standards for outdoor building materials.</p><p>The technical advantages of AluCore™ Decking include an extended joist span of 60–80 cm without requiring extra substructure support, minimal thermal expansion to avoid warping, and superior load-bearing capacity for high-traffic zones. These attributes position it as an ideal choice for commercial platforms, poolside areas, and public spaces demanding both durability and visual appeal.</p><p>KR WPC, a pioneer in composite decking, prioritizes sustainability and quality in its manufacturing. The company's process involves wood fiber, high-density polyethylene (HDPE), and cutting-edge chemical additives, processed through custom molds using high-temperature technology. This approach yields eco-friendly products that are fire, water, and UV resistant, guaranteeing performance and longevity for more than two decades.</p><p>With 36 continuous production lines, proprietary mold designs featuring over 340 types, and certifications like CE and FCS, KR WPC demonstrates its dedication to innovation and excellence.
