<p>Rising Phoenix Royalties has successfully closed a strategic divestiture in Weld County, Colorado, within the DJ Basin, marking a significant milestone in its operational strategy. This move highlights the firm's adeptness at responding to drilling and development signals, a cornerstone of its business model. The asset in question, located under PDC Energy-operated acreage now owned by Chevron, was acquired after the identification of five drilled but uncompleted wells that had remained inactive for over 18 months. The firm's quick action to negotiate the acquisition upon detecting a frack crew's presence on site underscores its proactive approach.</p><p>Jace Graham, CEO and Founder of Rising Phoenix Royalties, highlighted the deal as a testament to the firm's methodology: spotting opportunities, confirming field activity, and acting swiftly to secure assets. The transaction saw a portion of the position allocated to the Maroon Bells Fund, with the rest sold to institutional buyers, demonstrating the firm's versatile capital deployment and return strategy. The RP Royalties platform played a pivotal role in facilitating this transaction, known for its expertise in basin-specific execution and rejuvenating underdeveloped mineral assets with imminent potential.</p><p>Adam Lapucha, VP of Engineering, pointed to the team's extensive basin knowledge and precise timing as key factors in the deal's success. This achievement is part of Rising Phoenix Royalties' continued success in the DJ Basin, where it leverages a combination of local insights, technical underwriting, and a robust network of field brokers to pinpoint high-quality mineral assets before they attract wider market attention. The firm remains committed to pursuing both producing and undeveloped assets across the DJ, Permian, and Mid-Con basins, aligning operator signals with its internal risk assessment models.</p>
