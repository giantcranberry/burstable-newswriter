This project, integral to UGI's broader infrastructure enhancement efforts, also opens the door for select homes and businesses along the project's path to transition to natural gas. With an expected completion date by the end of September, the undertaking will impact traffic and parking on several key streets, including North Charlotte Street, West Grant Street, West Strawberry Street, West Filbert Street, East Filbert Street, and New Dorwart Street.</p><p>Construction is scheduled from Monday to Friday, 7:00am to 5:00pm, potentially leading to road closures, detours, and delays.
