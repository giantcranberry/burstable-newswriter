<p>Nicola Mining Inc. (TSX.V: NIM) (OTCQB: HUSIF) has commenced the processing of high-grade gold-silver ore from Talisker Resources Inc. at its Merritt Mill facility, marking a significant milestone in its operations. This initiative is timely, as the global appetite for gold and silver reaches unprecedented levels, fueled by investors and central banks in search of stability during economic uncertainties. The company plans to process 60,000 tonnes of ore each year, with an ambitious target of producing 21,000 ounces of gold-equivalent at full capacity.</p><p>The current surge in the value of precious metals is not without precedent. Central banks have been aggressively increasing their gold reserves, purchasing over 1,000 tonnes in 2024 alone. This figure represents a doubling of the decade's average, pushing global reserves to nearly 36,000 tonnes, a peak not seen since the Bretton Woods era. Gold prices have mirrored this demand, breaking records by exceeding US$3,500 per ounce in April 2025. Nicola Mining's strategic decision to enhance its production capabilities is a direct response to these market dynamics, underscoring the critical role of minerals like gold and silver in the global economy.</p><p>For more insights into Nicola Mining's operational advancements and the broader context of the escalating demand for precious metals, visit <a href='https://ibn.fm/Vs8Tt' rel='nofollow' target='_blank'>https://ibn.fm/Vs8Tt</a> and <a href='https://ibn.fm/Kk8mC' rel='nofollow' target='_blank'>https://ibn.fm/Kk8mC</a>.</p>
