<p>PowerBank Corporation, a leader in the clean energy sector, has announced a strategic partnership with Intellistake Technologies Corp., aiming to explore the intersection of digital assets, energy, and tokenized finance. This collaboration is centered around the creation of a Bitcoin-based Digital Asset Treasury Program, with Intellistake offering custody and treasury management services. Furthermore, the partnership will delve into the potential for tokenizing PowerBankâ€™s clean energy assets or shares, presenting an innovative financing alternative.</p><p>Dr. Richard Lu, CEO of PowerBank, highlighted the partnership's objective to merge traditional energy infrastructure with the digital economy.

This partnership not only underscores the transformative potential of combining clean energy with digital assets but also positions both companies at the forefront of this emerging market.</p><p>The collaboration between PowerBank and Intellistake signifies a critical evolution in the energy sector, facilitating a bridge between renewable energy projects and the digital asset space.
