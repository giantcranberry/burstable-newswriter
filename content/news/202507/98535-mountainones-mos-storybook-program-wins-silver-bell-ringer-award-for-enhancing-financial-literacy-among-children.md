<p>MountainOne has recently been recognized with a Silver Bell Ringer Award at the 57th Annual PR Club Bell Ringer Awards for its Mo's Storybook Program. This initiative, designed to promote financial literacy and personal development among children, has made a significant impact through its engaging approach. The program centers around an original illustrated book, 'How to Climb a Mountain,' featuring Mo the MountainOne Spokesgoat, and has successfully reached over 2,000 children in the Berkshires and South Shore areas through live readings and book distributions.</p><p>The success of the initial campaign has spurred the creation of a second book, 'Something to Save,' further demonstrating MountainOne's dedication to educating young minds on the values of confidence, goal-setting, and prudent saving habits. Jill Amato, Senior Vice President of Marketing and Community Banking at MountainOne, shared her pride in the program's recognition and its positive influence on children's educational journeys.</p><p>This accolade highlights the effectiveness of integrating storytelling with financial education to captivate and educate young audiences. MountainOne has credited the collaborative efforts of HATCH The Agency, author Doug Murphy, illustrator Laura Salafia, and PRfirst for their roles in the program's success. The PR Club Bell Ringer Awards, which honor outstanding achievements in public relations and communications, have thus spotlighted MountainOne's innovative strategy in community education, setting a benchmark for future initiatives in the field.</p>
