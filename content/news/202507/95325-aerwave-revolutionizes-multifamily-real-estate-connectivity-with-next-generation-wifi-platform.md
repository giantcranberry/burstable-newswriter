<p>Ed Wolff, CEO of Aerwave, is at the forefront of a significant shift in multifamily real estate connectivity, introducing a next-generation managed WiFi platform designed to overcome the limitations of traditional broadband services. Aerwave's solution, which utilizes a 100% fiber network backbone alongside proprietary software, provides instant-on, gigabit-plus internet access throughout entire properties. This ensures residents benefit from uninterrupted, secure, and high-speed connectivity, a stark contrast to the fragmented networks and dead zones commonly encountered in multifamily buildings.</p><p>Since its inception in 2019, Aerwave has rapidly expanded, now serving over 28 markets across the nation and supporting more than 50,000 apartment homes. The company's impressive client base includes 30% of the NMHC Top 50 Owners and Managers, underscoring its growing prominence in the multifamily sector. Wolff highlights the core issue Aerwave addresses: the complexity and unreliability of traditional broadband in multifamily settings, where residents frequently face connectivity challenges.</p><p>In today's digital age, broadband access is no longer a luxury but a fundamental utility in multifamily housing, with residents demanding reliable, high-speed internet as a basic amenity. Despite this, outdated infrastructure, prohibitive upgrade costs, and regulatory hurdles often impede universal access. Aerwave distinguishes itself from national broadband providers by tailoring its services to the specific needs of multifamily owners and residents, offering a comprehensive managed WiFi experience that is rarely available from major ISPs.</p><p>Aerwave's platform stands out for its instant-on connectivity, private secure networks for each resident, seamless mobility across the property, and exceptional customer support. These features not only significantly improve the resident experience but also contribute to increased net operating income and operational efficiencies for property owners. Looking forward, Wolff anticipates a future where property-wide connectivity is as dependable and indispensable as utilities like electricity and water, with managed WiFi platforms such as Aerwave setting the standard in the residential rental market.</p>
