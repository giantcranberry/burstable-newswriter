<p>SolarBank Corporation has achieved a critical milestone for its 7.2 MW Hoadley Hill Road ground-mount solar project in upstate New York, with the successful completion of the Coordinated Electric System Interconnection Review (CESIR). This approval paves the way for the project to contribute significantly to New York's renewable energy landscape, aiming to power around 850 homes through the state's grid. The project leverages New York's VDER compensation mechanism and could qualify for up to US$0.395/W DC in NYSERDA NY-Sun incentives, highlighting its economic and environmental benefits.</p><p>As a community solar initiative, the Hoadley Hill Road project enables residents and businesses to access solar energy benefits without the need for individual on-site installations, offering bill credits instead. This model not only broadens access to renewable energy but also supports New York's ambitious goal of installing 6 GW of solar power by 2025. With a track record of over 100 MW of completed projects and a pipeline exceeding 1 GW, SolarBank is at the forefront of accelerating the state's solar energy adoption through streamlined permitting and financing processes.</p><p>The progress of the Hoadley Hill Road project exemplifies the critical role of community solar in the transition to sustainable energy. By making clean energy more accessible, such initiatives are key to reducing carbon emissions and promoting environmental sustainability. SolarBank's advancements in New York underscore the potential of solar energy to meet both state and national energy objectives, reinforcing its importance in the future energy mix.</p>
