<p>ADISA, the largest trade association for the alternative investments industry in the nation, has taken a significant step towards its future by appointing Jade Miller as its first chief executive officer. This newly created position underscores ADISA's dedication to fostering strategic growth and innovation within the sector. Miller, known for her dynamic leadership and visionary approach, previously held the distinction of being the youngest president of ADISA's board of directors. Her appointment is expected to bring fresh perspectives to the organization, with a focus on driving innovation, enhancing market influence, and modernizing ADISA's infrastructure and communications.</p><p>Working alongside John Grady, who was appointed executive director in June, Miller will play a crucial role in advancing ADISA's mission. Grady will continue to manage legal, financial, and regulatory matters, ensuring a collaborative effort to propel the organization forward. Miller's extensive experience, including her leadership in the unification of TNDDA and ADISA and her tenure as president of capital markets at Bourne Financial Group, where she oversaw more than $1 billion in assets, positions her as a transformative leader for ADISA.</p><p>Matt Iak, president of ADISA's board, praised Miller for her deep understanding of the alternatives landscape and her capacity to initiate strategic changes without compromising the organization's core values. This leadership transition is viewed as a critical juncture for ADISA, reflecting its adaptive leadership model and forward-looking aspirations in the alternative investments industry. The appointment of Miller as CEO is not just a milestone for ADISA but also signals the organization's commitment to shaping the future of alternative investments through education, advocacy, and networking.</p>
