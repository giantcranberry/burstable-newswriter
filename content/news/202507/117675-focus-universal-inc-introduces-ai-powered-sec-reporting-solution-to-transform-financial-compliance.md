<p>Focus Universal Inc. (NASDAQ: FCUV) has announced the release of a groundbreaking fully automated SEC reporting solution that utilizes artificial intelligence to revolutionize the financial reporting process for public companies. This development comes as a response to the longstanding issues associated with SEC financial reporting, including its complexity, the high costs involved, and the considerable amount of time it traditionally requires.</p><p>The innovative software automates every step of the SEC reporting process. It seamlessly retrieves financial data from popular accounting platforms such as Oracle and QuickBooks, generates consolidated financial statements, fills out SEC reports, and applies XBRL tags automatically. This comprehensive automation transforms a process that once took weeks of manual effort into one that can be completed in minutes, offering a distinct edge over the semi-automated solutions that currently dominate the market.</p><p>Desheng Wang, CEO of Focus Universal, emphasized the software's potential to redefine SEC financial reporting. By removing the need for manual processes, the solution enables professionals to dedicate more time to strategic activities. Its user-friendly design ensures that it can be used immediately, without the need for setup or extensive training.</p><p>The global financial reporting software market, which was valued at US $13.9 billion in 2022, is expected to expand to US $36.6 billion by 2030. This growth is fueled by the escalating complexity of financial data and the demand for more efficient reporting mechanisms. Focus Universal's new solution is well-positioned to benefit from this trend, providing a scalable and intelligent tool that alleviates the labor-intensive demands of SEC compliance.</p><p>This announcement highlights Focus Universal's dedication to pioneering advancements in the IoT, 5G, and financial reporting sectors.
