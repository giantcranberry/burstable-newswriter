<p>Pharos Premium Infused Beverages has achieved significant recognition at the Wine & Spirits Wholesalers of America (WSWA) tasting competition in Denver, with its Black Cherry flavor securing a Gold medal and Mango earning Silver in the hemp beverage category. This accolade not only celebrates the brand's commitment to quality and innovation but also signals a shift in consumer preferences towards THC-infused alternatives to traditional alcoholic beverages.</p><p>Founded by Mary Eggers Bernuth and Rhyno Stinchfield, Pharos was born out of a desire to create a mindful way to unwind, offering delicious, approachable THC-infused beverages. The founders aimed to fill a gap in the market for products that serve as a gentle introduction to THC, providing a flavorful, lower-dose option for those curious about cannabis-infused drinks but wary of higher potency levels.</p><p>Each Pharos beverage contains 5 mg of hemp-derived THC, carefully measured to ensure a balanced and approachable experience. The brand's dedication to safety and trust is evident in its rigorous third-party lab testing, which guarantees consistent potency, purity, and quality across its product line. This recent recognition at the WSWA tasting competition not only validates Pharos's efforts but also underscores the growing acceptance and demand for THC-infused beverages as a viable and enjoyable alternative to alcohol.</p><p>The success of Pharos at such a prestigious event is a testament to the evolving landscape of the beverage industry, where THC-infused options are increasingly seen as legitimate competitors to traditional alcoholic drinks. This shift reflects broader changes in societal attitudes towards cannabis and its derivatives, paving the way for more innovation and acceptance in the market.</p>
