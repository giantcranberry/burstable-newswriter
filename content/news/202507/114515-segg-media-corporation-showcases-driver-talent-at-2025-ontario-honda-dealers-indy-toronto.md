Callum Ilott from PREMA Racing impressively advanced from 13th to 8th place, marking his best performance this season and the team's highest finish yet. Louis Foster of Rahal Letterman Lanigan Racing also demonstrated exceptional skill, qualifying in 7th and briefly reaching 3rd during the race, despite a setback that resulted in a 21st-place finish after an extended pit stop.</p><p>The company's executives praised both drivers for their resilience and talent, highlighting the event's significance as SEGG Media prepares for its 2026 Young Drivers Academy.
