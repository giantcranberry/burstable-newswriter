<p>Priority Capital Advisory has successfully finalized a $12 million bridge loan for Hudson West, a newly completed 50-unit Class A multifamily property located in Vancouver, WA. This financial strategy, executed on behalf of Cascadia Development Partners, replaces a maturing construction loan, thereby enhancing the project's financial flexibility during its critical lease-up and stabilization phases. The property, situated at 2411 Broadway Street, exemplifies the increasing demand for premium urban living spaces beyond Portland's city limits.</p><p>Zachary Streit, Founder and President of Priority Capital Advisory, emphasized the deal's importance, pointing to the competitive lender process and aggressive timeline that culminated in securing a non-recourse lease-up bridge loan. This accomplishment not only aligns with the client's strategic objectives but also protects their equity, demonstrating Priority Capital Advisory's adeptness at maneuvering through intricate market scenarios with accuracy and speed.</p><p>Hudson West is currently witnessing robust leasing activity. The development offers a diverse mix of 11 studios, 25 one-bedrooms, and 14 two-bedrooms, all crafted with Scandinavian-contemporary design elements. Features such as private balconies, gourmet kitchens, walk-in closets, and high-end finishes, alongside amenities like a coffee bar, multiple common areas, and 39 secured parking spaces, significantly elevate its attractiveness to prospective tenants.</p><p>Located near Main Street and a mere five minutes from the $1.6 billion Vancouver Waterfront masterplan, Hudson West presents a compelling option for individuals desiring urban lifestyle benefits without the additional cost of Portland's state income tax. Scott Lindgren, Partner at Cascadia Development Partners, commended Priority Capital Advisory for their dependable and efficient handling of pivotal financial transactions.</p><p>Since its establishment slightly over a year ago, Priority Capital Advisory has completed $450 million in debt financing across 20 transactions. The firm's growing reputation for delivering results under pressure and providing liquidity for leading sponsors in demanding markets is increasingly recognized.
