<p>Water Wings Swim School, established in 2003 by Avi Shafshak and his wife Tracy, has evolved from a single location in Las Vegas to a network of 13 corporate-owned schools across four states, dedicated to swim education for children. The recent acquisition by Unleashed Brands has initiated a new chapter for Water Wings, introducing a national franchise program that has quickly secured eight franchise agreements in just two months.</p><p>The founders' expertise in swim instruction, child psychology, and business has been instrumental in crafting Water Wings' distinctive approach in the swim education industry. The school stands out with its year-round programs catering to all ages, reduced buildout costs, and versatile ownership models, including remote management options, enhancing its appeal as a franchise opportunity. Membership in the United States Swim School Association further underscores Water Wings' commitment to excellence in aquatic education.</p><p>Collaboration with Unleashed Brands has endowed Water Wings with cutting-edge technology, marketing resources, and operational know-how, accelerating the school's growth trajectory. The franchise program's rapid uptake is credited to confidence in the Unleashed Brands ecosystem, the effectiveness of the swim curriculum, and the overarching goal to reduce childhood drownings. Water Wings is on the lookout for franchisees who are eager to make a difference in their communities, offering them extensive training and continuous support to foster sustainable success.</p><p>Future plans for Water Wings include penetrating new markets to extend its lifesaving swim instruction to more communities, all while upholding the brand's hallmark of quality and compassion. This expansion transcends mere business growth, aiming to enrich children's lives by instilling confidence and a passion for swimming.</p>
