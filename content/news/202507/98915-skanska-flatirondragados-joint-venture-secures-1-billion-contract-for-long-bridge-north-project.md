<p>The Skanska-FlatironDragados Joint Venture has been selected by the Virginia Passenger Rail Authority (VPRA) to undertake the $1-billion Long Bridge North Project. This initiative marks a significant step towards modernizing and expanding rail services in the region, transitioning from a two-track to a four-track system to accommodate increased freight and passenger rail demands.</p><p>Spanning approximately one mile from East Potomac Park to Washington D.C.’s L’Enfant Interlocking, the project will allocate the eastern tracks for CSX Transportation, Inc. (CSXT) freight rail, while the western tracks will be dedicated to passenger services, including Amtrak Virginia, Amtrak’s long-distance service, and Virginia Railway Express (VRE). This strategic division is expected to streamline operations and enhance the efficiency of both freight and passenger rail services, contributing to the broader integration of transportation networks across local, regional, and national levels.</p><p>Michael Viggiano of Skanska USA Civil and Jim Schneiderman of FlatironDragados have both emphasized the project's potential to revolutionize rail service in the Capital Region, underscoring the collaborative approach to minimizing construction risks and ensuring schedule and cost certainty. With construction set to begin in July 2025 and conclude by the fourth quarter of 2030, the project involves a coalition of stakeholders, including CSXT, Amtrak, VRE, the District Department of Transportation (DDOT), the National Park Service (NPS), and the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA).</p><p>This development is not just a milestone for the Skanska-FlatironDragados Joint Venture but also a critical infrastructure upgrade that promises to alleviate current rail congestion, support future growth, and improve the overall reliability and capacity of rail services in one of the nation's most congested corridors. The Long Bridge North Project is a testament to the importance of public-private partnerships in addressing the infrastructure challenges of the 21st century.</p>
