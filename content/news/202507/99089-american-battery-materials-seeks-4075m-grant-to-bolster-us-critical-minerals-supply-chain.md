<p>American Battery Materials, Inc. (ABM) has made a strategic move to enhance the United States' supply chain for critical minerals by applying for a $40,750,000 grant under the Defense Production Act-Title III. This initiative is aimed at diminishing the country's reliance on foreign sources for lithium and magnesium, minerals that are indispensable for national security and the global shift towards renewable energy.</p><p>David E Graber, CEO of ABM, emphasized the significance of the company's role in this endeavor, noting the presence of lithium and magnesium in their historical brine composition. ABM's proposal is designed to support the U.S. government in establishing a dependable domestic supply chain for these essential minerals, aligning with broader governmental priorities to streamline funding for energy infrastructure and critical mineral projects.</p><p>The company plans to utilize its mineral rights on 14,000 acres of Federal BLM land in southeastern Utah, supported by extensive USGS well data spanning five decades. This project underscores ABM's proactive stance in meeting the strategic demand for domestic sources of rare earth and battery metals, which are increasingly vital for the nation's security and technological progress.</p>
