<p>Lantern Pharma (NASDAQ: LTRN) has achieved a significant milestone in its ongoing Phase 1 trial of LP-284, reporting a complete metabolic response in a patient suffering from aggressive Grade 3 non-germinal center B-cell diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). This development is particularly noteworthy as it represents the first such response observed with LP-284, underscoring its potential as a groundbreaking therapy for patients with refractory lymphomas who have exhausted other treatment options.</p><p>The patient in question had previously undergone three treatments without success, including CAR-T and bispecific antibody therapy, yet responded positively after just two cycles of LP-284. This outcome highlights the drug's synthetic lethal mechanism, which was identified and developed using Lantern Pharma's proprietary RADR(R) AI platform. The success of LP-284 not only offers new hope for patients with limited treatment avenues but also positions Lantern Pharma as a significant contender in the $4 billion global B-cell cancer market.</p><p>This achievement is a testament to the transformative role of artificial intelligence in oncology drug development. Lantern Pharma's RADR(R) platform has facilitated the rapid progression of LP-284 from initial discovery to clinical trials, demonstrating the efficacy of AI-driven approaches in uncovering and advancing novel cancer therapies. The implications of this success extend beyond LP-284, validating the potential of AI to revolutionize the way cancer treatments are developed and brought to market.</p><p>For more information on this development, visit <a href='https://ibn.fm/TCGHH' rel='nofollow' target='_blank'>https://ibn.fm/TCGHH</a>.</p>
