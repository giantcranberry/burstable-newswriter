<p>The Suboxone tooth decay litigation, a significant legal challenge against Indivior, the manufacturer of Suboxone, is making notable progress as of July 2025. This multidistrict litigation (MDL) is rooted in compelling scientific evidence that connects sublingual Suboxone strips to serious dental problems, offering hope to those affected seeking redress.</p><p>A major obstacle in the litigation has been the delay in obtaining pharmacy records, crucial for verifying Suboxone usage. Walgreens is currently under legal examination for reportedly not providing these records within the required timeframe. A hearing is set to tackle this matter, contrasting with other entities such as Safeway and Porch Light Health, which have adhered to record production requests.</p><p>The composition of the plaintiff group has seen modifications, with 48 individuals out of an initial 500 being excluded from early-stage discovery due to voluntary withdrawal or documentation discrepancies. These spots have been filled through a random selection method, streamlining the group for the bellwether trial phase. This refinement ensures that the cases proceeding are strong, with 100 cases moving into more detailed discovery and four slated for trial.</p><p>Although more affected individuals are coming forward, a settlement does not appear imminent. Legal experts speculate that Indivior might be postponing discussions until the three-year statute of limitations expires, which could limit their liability to new claims. Substantive settlement talks are now anticipated to occur in late 2025 or early 2026.</p><p>For those suffering from dental injuries linked to Suboxone, keeping abreast of developments is essential.
