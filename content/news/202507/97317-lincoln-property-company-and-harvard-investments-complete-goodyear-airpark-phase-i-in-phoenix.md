<p>Lincoln Property Company and Harvard Investments have recently announced the completion of Goodyear AirPark Phase I, a 1.6 million-square-foot, six-building Class A industrial project in Phoenix. This development is a response to the growing demand for mid- to large-scale industrial spaces in the region, with a planned retail component, Estrella Gateway, set to begin construction in Q4 2025. The retail development will cover 63 acres and include up to 15 pads for full-service retail tenants, starting with a Quick Trip Travel Center.</p><p>Strategically positioned near major transportation routes and the Phoenix-Goodyear Airport, Goodyear AirPark is designed to serve as a central hub for logistics, advanced manufacturing, and semiconductor industries. Its location near the future Tres Rios Freeway/State Route 30 is expected to alleviate I-10 traffic, enhancing its attractiveness to large employers and industries looking for stable, long-term locations.</p><p>The first phase of the project includes buildings ranging from 81,000 to 775,000 square feet, featuring high ceilings, multiple loading options, and extensive parking facilities. With full utilities infrastructure and zoning for both industrial and commercial use, Goodyear AirPark Phase I provides businesses with a significant speed-to-market advantage. This phase is part of a larger 565-acre master plan that aims to develop approximately 7 million square feet of space across up to 20 buildings.</p><p>Designed by Butler Design Group and constructed by Stevens-Leinweber Construction, Inc., Goodyear AirPark is located in one of Phoenix's fastest-growing submarkets. Its proximity to major employers such as Microsoft, Amazon, and Walmart highlights its potential to attract a wide range of industrial and commercial tenants, further establishing Phoenix as a key player in the data center market sector.</p>
