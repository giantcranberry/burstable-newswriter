<p>As new Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) regulations such as California's Senate Bill 253 (SB253) and the European Union's Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) come into effect, businesses are grappling with the complexities of Scope 3 emissions reporting. Nate Greensphan, Director of Product Management at Redwood Logistics, underscores the urgency for companies, especially those in California with revenues exceeding $1 billion, to prepare for the upcoming reporting deadlines starting January 2026, irrespective of political sentiments.</p><p>The challenge of Scope 3 emissions reporting is compounded by significant data and knowledge gaps across supply chains, presenting a daunting and expensive task for large enterprises. SB253 is anticipated to initially affect approximately 5,400 U.S. companies, with wider repercussions for businesses connected through supply chains as ESG mandates grow. Greensphan points out that international companies already adhering to EU CSRD regulations may have a head start, whereas U.S.-only businesses face steeper challenges in preparing for Scope 3 reporting requirements under SB253 by 2027.</p><p>Gartner identifies ESG regulations as the second top business driver, emphasizing sustainability as both a compliance necessity and a market expectation. The growing preference among customers, investors, and stakeholders for sustainability-focused businesses positions ESG as a critical element for gaining a competitive edge. To aid companies in navigating these challenges, Redwood Logistics introduces its Redwood Hyperion platform. This solution offers comprehensive visibility into transportation emissions throughout supply chains, facilitating accurate operational-level data for Scope 3 compliance and advancing sustainability efforts.</p>
