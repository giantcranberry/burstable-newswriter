<p>LaFleur Minerals Inc. (CSE: LFLR) (OTCQB: LFLRF) (FSE: 3WK0) has taken a pivotal step towards the reactivation of its Beacon Gold Mill in Val-d’Or, Québec, by enlisting Bumigeme Inc. to perform an independent valuation. This assessment aims to determine the replacement value and the expenses associated with restarting the mill and its tailings facility, which saw over $20 million in enhancements in 2022. The valuation is a cornerstone of LaFleur Minerals' plan to obtain necessary financing and highlight the mill's capacity to significantly impact gold production, especially in relation to the Swanson Gold Project.</p><p>Amid predictions by J.P. Morgan that gold prices could soar to $4,100 by 2026, LaFleur Minerals is strategically positioning itself to benefit from these favorable market trends. The Beacon Gold Mill, with its ability to process more than 750 tonnes daily, stands as a critical asset not only for the Swanson Gold Project but also for potential custom milling services for adjacent gold projects. This initiative underscores LaFleur Minerals' dedication to progressing its extensive gold projects within the Abitibi Gold Belt, utilizing its comprehensive land holdings and infrastructure to generate sustained value.</p>
