<p>D1 Training, a fitness enrichment concept renowned for its athletic-based training programs, has further established its presence in Wichita by opening a second location at 3801 N Ridge Rd. This expansion highlights the brand's dedication to enhancing athletic performance across all age groups through scientifically supported training methods conducted by certified professionals.</p><p>The initiative to bring D1 Training to Wichita's east side in the fall of 2024 was spearheaded by the Suellentrop siblings and Jennifer Lines. With the addition of the West Wichita location, their goal to positively influence the local athletic community gains momentum. The facility categorizes its offerings into four age-specific programs: Rookie (ages 7-11), Developmental (ages 12-14), Prep (ages 15-18), and D1 Adult, all structured around five fundamental principles of athletic training. In addition to group workouts, D1 Training offers customized training solutions, such as group, semi-private, and individual coaching sessions with top-tier trainers.</p><p>Community engagement remains a cornerstone of D1 Training's philosophy. The Suellentrops' participation in the American Heart Association Walk, which raised over $2,000, exemplifies their commitment to societal contributions. With a network exceeding 100 performance centers across the country and over 100 more in the pipeline, D1 Training is on a fast track to growth. The brand is actively seeking franchisees who share a fervor for fitness and youth sports, with the ambition to foster positive change within their communities.
