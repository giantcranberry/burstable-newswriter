<p>Jean Navarro and Ana Angulo Perez, the visionary founders behind Mega Bee Pest Control and Rescues, have taken a significant step forward in their mission to protect pollinators with the launch of Mega Bee Honey. This new line of 100 percent raw, unfiltered honey is harvested from hives they rescue across Miami-Dade and Broward counties, offering a sustainable alternative to mass-produced honey. Their initiative not only provides a high-quality product but also plays a crucial role in educating the community about the importance of bees to our ecosystem.</p><p>The inception of Mega Bee Honey is deeply rooted in the couple's journey that began in 2020 with the establishment of their pest control and bee hive relocation services. By extending their operations into honey production, Navarro and Angulo Perez are able to further their environmental stewardship, with each jar of honey representing a rescued colony. Their approach underscores a commitment to sustainability, quality, and community engagement, setting a new standard for how businesses can contribute positively to environmental conservation.</p><p>What sets Mega Bee Honey apart from commercially available options is its unpasteurized and unfiltered nature, ensuring the preservation of nutritional value and natural flavors. The bees responsible for this honey are carefully relocated from unsafe locations to managed apiaries, where they continue to play a vital role in pollinating local flora. This meticulous process highlights the founders' dedication to not just producing honey, but also fostering a healthier environment.</p><p>Available for purchase through the company's website and at select farmers markets in Miami and Broward, Mega Bee Honey is more than just a product; it's a tool for change. Proceeds from sales are earmarked for educational programs and workshops aimed at promoting pollinator conservation and community education. Navarro and Angulo Perez's venture exemplifies a business model where environmental impact and community benefit are at the forefront, offering a blueprint for others to follow in the pursuit of sustainability and social responsibility.</p>
