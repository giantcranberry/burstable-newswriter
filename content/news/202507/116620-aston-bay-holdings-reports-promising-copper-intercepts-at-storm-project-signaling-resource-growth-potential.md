<p>Aston Bay Holdings Ltd. (TSX.V: BAY) (OTCQB: ATBHF) has recently reported new copper intercepts at its Storm Project located on Somerset Island, Nunavut, underscoring the project's escalating potential. The 2025 exploration program, conducted by joint venture partner American West Metals, has successfully completed eight diamond drill holes, amounting to 1,786 meters. Among these, geotechnical holes have uncovered unexpected intervals of visual copper sulfide mineralization near the existing resource boundary, hinting at a robust potential for resource expansion.</p><p>Further bolstering the project's prospectivity are surface gossans that align with conductivity anomalies identified through the MobileMT survey. With 80% of the initial development costs now secured via an agreement with Ocean Partners, the project's risk profile has been significantly reduced, as stated by CEO Thomas Ullrich. This development paves the way for the Storm Copper Project to progress further into pre-feasibility stages, marking a critical step towards its eventual realization.</p><p>The Storm Project encompasses both the Storm Copper Project and the Seal Zinc Deposit, operating under a 20/80 unincorporated joint venture between Aston Bay and American West Metals Limited, along with its wholly-owned subsidiary, Tornado Metals Ltd. Aston Bay benefits from a free carried interest in this arrangement until American West decides to proceed with mining, following the completion of a bankable feasibility study.
