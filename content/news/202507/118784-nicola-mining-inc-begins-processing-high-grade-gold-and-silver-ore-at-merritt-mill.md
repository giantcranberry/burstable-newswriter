<p>Nicola Mining Inc. (TSX.V: NIM) (OTCQB: HUSIF) has commenced the processing of high-grade gold and silver ore at its Merritt Mill facility, signaling a pivotal shift towards establishing itself as a consistent producer in the precious metals industry. The Merritt Mill, with its capacity to process 60,000 tons of ore and produce 21,000 ounces of gold-equivalent concentrate annually at full production, is poised to play a central role in Nicola's operations. This development is expected to generate stable revenue streams and bolster the company's copper, gold, and silver projects throughout British Columbia.</p><p>Peter Espig, CEO of Nicola Mining, emphasized the rarity and importance of junior mining companies achieving such production milestones. He also acknowledged the enhanced efficiencies in British Columbia's permitting process for underground mining operations, which are recognized for their lower environmental footprint. In addition to ramping up production, Nicola Mining is expanding its geological team and exploration efforts, with a particular focus on the New Craigmont Project and the Treasure Mountain silver mine.</p><p>The Merritt Mill distinguishes itself as the sole third-party processing facility in British Columbia permitted to process both gold and silver mill feed using gravity and flotation methods. This unique capability, along with Nicola's ownership of high-grade projects such as the New Craigmont Copper Project and the Treasure Mountain Silver Project, sets the company on a path for substantial growth within the mining sector. The initiation of ore processing at the Merritt Mill not only underscores Nicola Mining's operational advancements but also highlights the potential for increased production and profitability in the precious metals market.</p>
