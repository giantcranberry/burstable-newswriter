<p>ESGold Corp. (CSE: ESAU) (OTCQB: ESAUF) has announced that its Ambient Noise Tomography (ANT) survey results at the Montauban Gold-Silver Project have confirmed the presence of mineralized zones extending up to 1,200 metres deep. This discovery aligns with previous academic research, drawing significant parallels between Montauban and Australia's renowned Broken Hill deposit. The findings underscore the importance of sulphide melting, hydrothermal activity, and structural deformation in the remobilization of precious metals, now supported by ESGold's comprehensive geophysical data.</p><p>The implications of these findings are substantial for the mining industry and investors alike. The Montauban project is being redefined as a complex, multi-lens system with the potential to match the scale and significance of both the Broken Hill and Scandinavian massive sulfide systems. This positions ESGold Corp. at the forefront of exploring potentially one of the most significant gold-silver projects in recent years.</p><p>ESGold is currently integrating these academic insights with its geophysical data into a detailed 3D model. This model aims to guide future exploration efforts and expedite the company's strategy for near-term production and cash flow generation from tailings. The successful application of ANT technology at Montauban not only validates the project's vast potential but also sets a precedent for the use of advanced geophysical methods in mineral exploration.</p><p>For further details on ESGold Corp.'s groundbreaking findings and their implications for the mining sector, visit <a href='https://ibn.fm/qcDTE' rel='nofollow' target='_blank'>https://ibn.fm/qcDTE</a>.</p>
