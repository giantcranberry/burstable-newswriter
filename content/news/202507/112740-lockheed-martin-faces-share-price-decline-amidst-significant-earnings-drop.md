<p>Lockheed Martin Corp. witnessed a significant downturn in its share price after announcing a substantial decrease in second-quarter earnings, attributed to more than $1.6 billion in program-related charges. The aerospace and defense leader posted revenues of $18.2 billion for the quarter, slightly up from the previous year but falling short of analysts' expectations. Net earnings plummeted to $342 million, or $1.46 per share, from $1.6 billion, or $6.85 per share, in the same period last year, with major write-downs affecting several key programs.</p><p>A notable $950 million pretax charge was recorded on a classified Aeronautics program, with additional losses stemming from the Canadian Maritime Helicopter Program and Turkey's utility helicopter program, amounting to $570 million and $95 million, respectively. The U.S. Air Force's Next Generation Air Dominance program also contributed to the financial strain with further charges. Despite these setbacks, Lockheed Martin's executives expressed confidence in the company's long-term growth and its pivotal role in global defense operations.</p><p>Operational cash flow drastically decreased to $201 million, and free cash flow turned negative, primarily due to heightened working capital needs. The company, however, reaffirmed its full-year 2025 guidance, though with a lowered earnings per share outlook. Performance across segments was mixed; Aeronautics saw revenue growth but faced an operating loss, whereas Missiles and Fire Control, along with the Space segment, reported positive developments, bolstered by missile defense and civil space contracts.</p><p>Lockheed Martin emphasized its robust backlog and investments in cutting-edge technologies, including the 'Golden Dome for America' initiative, as indicators of its enduring strength. Nonetheless, the adverse market reaction underscores persistent apprehensions regarding potential execution challenges and margin pressures extending beyond the current fiscal quarter.</p>
