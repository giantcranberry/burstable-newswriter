<p>Steel Peak, a commercial real estate investment firm, has successfully sold a 12,000-square-foot industrial outdoor storage (IOS) property in El Cajon, California, for $9.5 million. This sale represents a significant profit from its acquisition price of $6.3 million in February 2024. The buyer, C&M Manufacturing, Inc., intends to utilize the site for its oil and gas industry operations, highlighting the property's appeal to owner-users in specific industries.</p><p>The transaction underscores the robust demand for IOS properties in Southern California, especially those catering to contractors and construction-related businesses. Steel Peak's value-add strategy, which involved demolishing outdated structures and upgrading the site with new paving and fencing, played a crucial role in enhancing the property's functionality and attractiveness. This approach not only maximized the property's value but also demonstrated the effectiveness of targeted redevelopment in the IOS market.</p><p>Blake Rodgers and Pasha Johnson, Co-Founders of Steel Peak, emphasized the significance of the sale. Rodgers highlighted the firm's ability to swiftly execute its investment plan and secure a sale to a long-term owner-user, while Johnson pointed to the scarcity of entitled IOS properties and the competitive landscape for well-located sites as key market drivers. The property's M-54 zoning, entitlement for outside storage, and multiple access points further contributed to its desirability.</p><p>The deal was brokered by Cameron Czubernat and Kerry Schimpf of Commercial Property Group for Steel Peak, with Aidan James of Inland Pacific representing the buyer. This sale not only validates Steel Peak's investment strategy but also signals the continued strength of the IOS market in strategic locations. Steel Peak remains focused on identifying and capitalizing on IOS investment opportunities across the Western U.S., targeting properties with capitalized values between $3 million and $50 million.</p>
