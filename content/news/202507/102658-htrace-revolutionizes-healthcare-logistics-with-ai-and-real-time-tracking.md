<p>Javier Cuello, founder of H+Trace, has transitioned his expertise from the live music industry to healthcare logistics, creating a platform that integrates real-time tracking, automation, and artificial intelligence. This shift highlights the critical role of precision, timing, and technology in complex environments, particularly in healthcare diagnostics.</p><p>With a background in electronic engineering, sound engineering, and public sector innovation, Cuello has applied his cross-disciplinary skills to develop H+Trace. The platform's unique approach involves owning every component of the hardware and software stack, ensuring adaptability and efficiency. This strategy is particularly effective in addressing the preanalytical phase of lab diagnostics, a segment often plagued by inefficiencies and errors.</p><p>The Contactless MultiSense platform by H+Trace stands out by automating the preanalytical phase and introducing reliability through predictive analytics and AI. These technologies enable the detection and prevention of cargo damage in real time, a feature that has already traced over 11 million samples. The insights gained from this extensive tracking have fueled the platform's evolution, including the development of Agentic AI for autonomous lab intelligence.</p><p>As H+Trace gears up for expansion into the U.S. market, its innovations in at-home blood draws and smart packaging—capable of passive self-cooling or freezing—promise to significantly enhance sample monitoring and reduce turnaround times. Cuello's vision and the advancements made by H+Trace underscore the transformative potential of technology in streamlining healthcare logistics, offering a glimpse into a future where efficiency and reliability are paramount.</p>
