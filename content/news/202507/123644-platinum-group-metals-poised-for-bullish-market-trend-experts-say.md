Traditionally overshadowed by more prominent investment metals like gold and copper, PGMs are now gaining attention for their potential in the investment world and their critical role in various industries.</p><p>The firm's analysis points to a combination of market conditions that are expected to drive the prices of PGMs upward. This trend is not only promising for investors but also underscores the increasing relevance of these metals in sectors such as automotive and technology.
