<p>Squalify, a Munich-based startup under the leadership of CEO Asdrúbal Pichardo, is revolutionizing the way organizations perceive and manage cybersecurity risks. By introducing a cyber risk quantification (CRQ) platform, Squalify aims to transition the view of cybersecurity from a purely technical challenge to a quantifiable business risk. This innovative platform utilizes Munich Re's proprietary cyber risk model, providing a top-down methodology for organizations to identify and measure financial exposures resulting from cyber threats.</p><p>The decision to expand into the U.S. market was driven by the growing necessity for organizations to approach cybersecurity as a critical business risk. Henry Meds, Squalify's inaugural U.S. client, exemplifies the platform's efficacy in risk quantification and its role in informing investment strategies. Recent updates to the platform, including features like Subsidiary Steering, Decision Simulations, and a Board of Management Report, are designed to empower global organizations with the insights needed for strategic cybersecurity decision-making.</p><p>Targeting key sectors such as digital health, financial services, manufacturing, and insurance, Squalify is at the forefront of addressing the intersection of cyber risk, regulatory demands, and financial responsibility. The company's overarching goal is to embed cyber risk management into the fabric of business strategy, advocating for a data-driven approach to decisions and contributing to the creation of a more robust global economy.</p>
