<p>The American Heart Association, through its Center for Health Technology and Innovation, has announced the selection of eight startups for its Heart and Brain Health Accelerator. This program is designed to harness the power of technology to improve patient outcomes, lower healthcare expenses, and remove obstacles to care, especially in the realm of women's heart and brain health. Lisa Suennen, managing partner of American Heart Association Ventures, highlighted the importance of innovation in combating heart disease and stroke.</p><p>The accelerator offers these startups mentorship, financial support, and access to a vast network of professionals, with the goal of accelerating the transition of their technologies from the drawing board to practical use. The cohort includes Kelvin Health, which employs artificial intelligence for the non-invasive diagnosis of vascular diseases, and LightHearted AI Health, known for its contactless device that detects heart conditions. Other participants like MOMM Diagnostics are working on a blood test for early detection of preeclampsia, and Powerful Medical is focusing on AI-enhanced ECG interpretation.</p><p>Additional startups in the program, such as Reach Neuro, Sinaptica Therapeutics, SynchNeuro, and Veravas, are introducing groundbreaking solutions ranging from aids for stroke recovery to non-invasive therapies for Alzheimer's and devices for monitoring blood sugar levels. These companies will also be part of the MedTech Innovator program, which provides further resources and a chance to compete in the MedTech Innovator Competition Finals. The selection process, overseen by a panel of experts in healthcare and technology, reflects the high potential of these innovations to significantly benefit women's health.</p>
