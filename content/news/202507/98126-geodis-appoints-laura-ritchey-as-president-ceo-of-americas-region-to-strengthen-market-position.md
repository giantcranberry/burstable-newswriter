<p>GEODIS, a global leader in transport and logistics, has announced the appointment of Laura Ritchey as President & CEO of its Americas region, marking a significant move to bolster its presence in the U.S. and across the Americas. Ritchey, who will also join the Group’s Executive Board, is tasked with overseeing the growth and operations of nearly 20,000 employees spread across eight countries in North and South America. This strategic appointment comes at a time when the logistics industry faces unprecedented challenges, requiring innovative leadership to navigate the complexities of global supply chains.</p><p>Marie-Christine Lombard, Chief Executive Officer of GEODIS, emphasized Ritchey's extensive industry expertise and leadership capabilities as critical assets for driving the company's success in the region. With a career spanning over three decades, Ritchey brings a wealth of experience in supply chain management and e-commerce, sectors that are increasingly pivotal in today’s fast-evolving logistics landscape. Her leadership is expected to not only enhance GEODIS' operational efficiency and profitability but also solidify its reputation as a comprehensive logistics provider offering global freight forwarding, contract logistics, and other specialized services.</p><p>The transition sees Mike Honious, Ritchey's predecessor, retiring after a distinguished 30-year career in the supply chain industry, including two decades at GEODIS. Honious will remain connected to the company through an advisory role and his ongoing involvement with the GEODIS Foundation and GEODIS Compassion Fund, ensuring a smooth leadership transition. Ritchey's appointment underscores GEODIS' commitment to maintaining its competitive edge in the Americas, a region that represents one of its most significant markets. Her proven track record in driving growth and operational excellence is anticipated to play a key role in the company's continued expansion and success in the global logistics sector.</p>
