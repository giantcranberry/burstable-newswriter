<p>Firestorm Labs, a San Diego-based innovator in advanced drone technology for warfare, has successfully closed a $47 million Series A funding round. This significant investment, led by New Enterprise Associates with contributions from defense-focused venture firms such as Lockheed Martin Ventures, Decisive Point, Washington Harbour Partners, and Booz Allen Ventures, alongside $12 million in venture debt from JPMorgan, marks a pivotal moment in military technology development. The funding underscores the critical role of Firestorm's distributed, additive manufacturing technology in creating low-cost, adaptable unmanned aerial systems (UAS) for military use.</p><p>Aaron Jacobson of New Enterprise Associates highlighted the importance of Firestorm's technology in enhancing military capabilities and ensuring troop safety. Similarly, Chris Moran from Lockheed Martin Ventures pointed out the strategic advantage of on-site 3D drone printing in securing the battlespace and advancing U.S. leadership in defense technologies. Firestorm intends to use the Series A funding to expand its xCell platform, which allows combat teams to manufacture and repair drones directly on the battlefield, significantly reducing production timelines and logistical challenges.</p><p>Mina Faltas of Washington Harbour Partners and Thomas Hendrix of Decisive Point both emphasized the transformative potential of Firestorm's technology in overcoming manufacturing capacity constraints within the military and acting as a force multiplier in defense operations. This investment not only represents a major milestone for Firestorm Labs but also accelerates the deployment of battlefield-ready solutions, reinforcing the technological superiority of U.S. and allied forces in complex operational environments.</p>
