<p>The Better World Regulatory Coalition Inc. (BWRCI) has taken a pivotal step towards securing artificial intelligence (AI) systems with the launch of the Quantum-Secured AI Fail-Safe Protocol (QSAFP) open-source repository on GitHub. This initiative represents a groundbreaking approach to AI safety, leveraging quantum boundaries and controlled runtimes to mitigate risks associated with AI misuse. The repository, accessible at <a href='https://github.com/QSAFP-Core/qsafp-open-core' rel='nofollow' target='_blank'>github.com/QSAFP-Core/qsafp-open-core</a>, encourages collaboration from developers and researchers worldwide to contribute to its public layers, including protocol specifications, SDK tools, and API documentation.</p><p>Max Davis, the founder of BWRCI, highlighted the protocol's role as a foundational infrastructure for AI safety. QSAFP is designed to maintain human oversight over AI systems, irrespective of their power, through mechanisms like runtime expiration, command authorization limits, and quantum-sealed checkpoints. These features are crucial for preventing irreversible misuse of AI technologies, ensuring they remain under human control.</p><p>In a move to broaden the protocol's impact, BWRCI is actively seeking founding partners for commercial SDK integrations and the development of quantum-secured fail-safe chipsets. The organization has reached out to Meta's AI leadership and submitted the protocol to DARPA, underscoring its commitment to aligning with both industry leaders and national security entities. Rooted in international patent-pending research and development, QSAFP is envisioned as a lightweight, provable standard that is compatible with both open and closed AI systems, marking a significant milestone in the quest for safer AI technologies.</p>
