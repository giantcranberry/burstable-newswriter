<p>Goliath Resources Limited, under the portfolio of McEwen Mining Inc., has reported the discovery of six new visible gold occurrences within a 96.5-meter mineralized interval from drill hole GD-25-302 at the Bonanza Zone on its Golddigger Property. This discovery, located in the prolific Golden Triangle of British Columbia, is part of an extensive drill program aimed at exploring a deep magnetic anomaly suspected to be connected to a theorized Motherlode source. The drill hole is projected to extend to a depth of 1,000 meters, with the mineralization observed closely mirroring the company's highest-grade intercept to date, thereby significantly expanding the known gold-rich system.</p><p>In light of these findings and the continuous discoveries being made, Goliath Resources has announced an expansion of its fully funded 2025 drill program from 40,000 to 60,000 meters. This strategic increase is designed to thoroughly explore the full potential of the Surebet system and assess its Reduced Intrusion Related Gold (RIRG) capabilities. The recent discoveries at the Golddigger Property highlight the site's substantial promise for gold extraction, representing a pivotal advancement in Goliath's exploration initiatives.</p><p>For more information on this development, visit <a href='https://ibn.fm/o5dds' rel='nofollow' target='_blank'>https://ibn.fm/o5dds</a>.</p>
