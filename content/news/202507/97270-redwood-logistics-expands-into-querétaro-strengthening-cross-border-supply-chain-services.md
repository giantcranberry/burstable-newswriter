<p>Redwood Logistics and Redwood Mexico have taken a significant step in their expansion strategy by opening a new office in Querétaro, Mexico. This move is designed to strengthen their cross-border supply chain services, positioning them closer to key industries in the Bajío region, a vital industrial area near Mexico City. The location offers strategic advantages, including proximity to major automotive, aerospace, and consumer goods manufacturers, as well as access to a skilled workforce.</p><p>Jordan Dewart, President of Redwood Mexico, highlighted the office's critical role in supporting nearshoring and cross-border supply chains, pointing out Querétaro's strategic importance. This expansion is part of Redwood's broader commitment to Mexico's expanding manufacturing sector, with ambitions to grow the local team to 100 employees within the next three years, supplementing the existing workforce of 200 in the country.</p><p>The Querétaro facility will serve as a hub for all of Redwood's business divisions, including technology solutions and managed services teams. This integration aims to deliver clients comprehensive, real-time supply chain visibility and local expertise. Dewart emphasized that this expansion is aligned with Redwood's strategy to capitalize on Mexico's status as a global manufacturing hub and to provide seamless logistics solutions between Mexico and the U.S.</p><p>This development follows Redwood's Monterrey expansion in 2023, showcasing the company's growth despite global trade challenges. With Mexico drawing $21.4 billion in foreign direct investment by the first quarter of 2025, Redwood's timely expansion meets the rising demand for dependable, shorter supply chains, fueled by the nearshoring movement.</p>
