<p>Notify, a healthcare technology company, is poised to introduce its Overlay software platform at the Florida Assisted Living Association (FALA) 2025 Annual Conference & Tradeshow. This innovative platform is designed to tackle the prevalent issue of managing disparate nurse call systems across senior living facilities. By integrating with over 25 nurse call manufacturers, Overlay facilitates standardization without the necessity for costly hardware upgrades, presenting a significant advancement in healthcare technology.</p><p>The Overlay platform distinguishes itself by enabling the standardization of nurse call systems within a mere two hours, a process that traditionally could take significantly longer. Furthermore, it modernizes communication within these communities by replacing outdated devices such as pagers and walkie-talkies with smartphones, utilizing existing WiFi infrastructure. This shift not only streamlines communication but also introduces real-time analytics capabilities. These analytics empower senior living communities to make informed decisions regarding staffing and resident care, ultimately leading to improved outcomes for residents.</p><p>Aligning with the conference's 'RIPPLE EFFECT' theme, Notify's presentation will highlight how the Overlay platform can mitigate caregiver burnout and enhance response times through its prioritized alert system. Greg Robertson, SVP and General Manager at Notify, shared his excitement about the opportunity to demonstrate the platform's potential to senior living leaders. He underscored the platform's flexibility, allowing operators to leverage their current investments while achieving a unified communication system.</p><p>In a move that underscores its dedication to transforming senior living operations, Notify is offering risk-free 60-day pilot programs and personalized demos at the event. This initiative reflects the company's commitment to not only improving operational efficiency but also addressing the critical issue of caregiver retention in the industry. The introduction of the Overlay platform at FALA 2025 marks a significant step forward in the integration of technology and healthcare, promising to reshape the landscape of senior living communications.</p>
