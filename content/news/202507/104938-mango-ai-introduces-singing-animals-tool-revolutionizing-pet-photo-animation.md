<p>Mango AI has recently launched an innovative tool that animates static pet photos into videos where the animals appear to sing in sync with uploaded audio. This tool utilizes advanced facial animation and voice synchronization technology to accurately map facial points on animal photos, enabling mouth movements to match any recorded audio. With a variety of singing styles available, including natural, operatic, and joyful, users can create unique characters and moods for their animated pets.</p><p>The simplicity of the tool is one of its standout features. Users only need to upload a pet photo and a music file or voice recording, and Mango AI generates a realistic singing animation in minutes. Additional features such as pose scale and lip scale controls allow for further customization, catering to different creative objectives. The tool's ease of use is enhanced by its no-installation requirement, allowing for video creation directly from a web browser. Moreover, the multi-format export options make it easy to share creations on popular platforms like Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube.</p><p>Winston Zhang, CEO of Mango Animate, highlighted the tool's potential impact on social media and marketing campaigns, noting its ability to provide an easy and engaging animation experience. In addition to the singing animals tool, Mango AI also offers a talking animals feature, broadening the scope for personalized animal videos.
