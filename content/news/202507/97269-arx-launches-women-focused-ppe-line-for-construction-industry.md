<p>ARX, a women-owned personal protective equipment (PPE) brand, has taken a significant step towards addressing the challenges faced by women in the construction industry with the launch of its first product line tailored specifically for them. This initiative is a direct response to the pervasive issue of ill-fitting safety gear, which has not only been a source of discomfort but also a safety concern for women working in male-dominated fields. The co-founders, Dr. Hilary Gallin and Kaitlin McCarthy, leveraged their personal experiences to design PPE that prioritizes both protection and a proper fit, underscoring the critical importance of safety and confidence in the workplace.</p><p>The inaugural collection features the Original Vest and Original Shirt, both incorporating the innovative Multipoint Fit System. This design breakthrough ensures a customized fit, enhanced breathability, and unrestricted mobility, addressing the unique needs of women in construction. The timing of this launch is particularly pertinent, coinciding with updated OSHA regulations that require PPE to properly fit all construction workers. ARX's vest stands out as it meets these stringent requirements, boasting ANSI-107 Type R Class 2 Certification.</p><p>Leading companies such as Tocci Building Companies and NorthBridge Partners have already begun utilizing ARX's products, a testament to the brand's dedication to improving workplace safety and supporting women in the industry. While the current lineup is focused on the construction sector, ARX has announced plans to broaden its range to cater to other industries in need of dependable, well-fitted safety gear. The PPE line is currently available for purchase at <a href='https://www.shoparxppe.com' rel='nofollow' target='_blank'>https://www.shoparxppe.com</a>, with additional styles and industry-specific equipment expected to be introduced in the near future.</p>
