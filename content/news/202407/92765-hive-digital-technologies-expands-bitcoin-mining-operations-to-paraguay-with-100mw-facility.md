<p>Hive Digital Technologies has announced plans to establish a 100-megawatt digital asset mining operation in Paraguay, a move that significantly boosts its Bitcoin mining capabilities. This expansion is expected to add up to 6.5 Exahash per second (EH/s) to Hive's operations, increasing its global mining capacity to 12.1 EH/s. The project underscores Hive's strategy to diversify its global presence and leverage Paraguay's favorable business environment and abundant energy resources.</p><p>The initiative is not just a milestone for Hive but also a strategic development for Paraguay. By utilizing surplus energy and paying energy bills in U.S. dollars, Hive provides the Paraguayan government with a stable income stream, acting as a hedge against currency volatility. This arrangement is particularly significant given that electricity exports constituted about 13.2% of Paraguay's total exports in 2023, with Hive's operation poised to enhance this figure further.</p><p>Hive's approach in Paraguay reflects its commitment to sustainable and innovative energy solutions. The company plans to apply its expertise in grid balancing and demand response to support industrial development in the country. This not only maximizes energy efficiency but also contributes to the sustainable development of Paraguay's power infrastructure, setting a benchmark for responsible growth in the digital asset mining sector.</p><p>The expansion into Paraguay is a testament to Hive's growing influence in the digital asset mining industry and its ability to forge strategic partnerships that benefit both the company and host countries. As the project unfolds, it is expected to attract more international investment to Paraguay's tech and energy sectors, further solidifying the country's position in the global digital economy.</p>
