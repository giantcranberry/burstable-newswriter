The Nova collection, with homes starting in the low $700,000s, spans 2,328 to 2,751 square feet and includes 4 to 5 bedrooms. This collection stands out for its innovative casita and accessory dwelling unit (ADU) designs, catering to empty nesters, first-time buyers, and multi-generational families. Todd Cunningham, WPG President, emphasized the versatility of these designs, which support extended family stays, potential rental income, and increased property value.</p><p>The Esprit collection offers another option for buyers, with prices ranging from $848,190 to $1,155,000 for homes that cover 1,992 to 2,925 square feet and include 3 to 5 bedrooms. These homes come equipped with Samsung appliances as standard and feature luxurious elements such as spacious great rooms, island kitchens, and owners' suites with walk-in wardrobes. For those interested in the Verve collection, only two homes remain, each offering 2,318 square feet of living space starting at $809,900. These two-story homes include distinctive features like rear-entry two-car garages and adaptable hobby spaces.</p><p>University Park's location offers significant advantages, including easy access to the 10 Freeway and proximity to essential services and leisure destinations. Nearby amenities encompass Eisenhower Health, schools under the Desert Sands and Palm Springs Unified School Districts, and recreational spots such as the El Paseo Shopping District and the Acrisure Arena. Residents also have access to The Grove, the development's amenity center, which features resort and lap pools, fitness facilities, playgrounds, pickleball courts, and outdoor gathering areas.
