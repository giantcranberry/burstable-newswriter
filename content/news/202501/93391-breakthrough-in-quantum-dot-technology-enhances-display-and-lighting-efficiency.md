<p>Scientists from Henan University in China have made a significant leap forward in the development of quantum dot light-emitting diodes (QLEDs), a technology pivotal for next-generation displays and lighting solutions. Their innovative use of 'giant' CdZnSe/ZnSeS quantum dots has led to the creation of QLEDs with markedly improved operational characteristics, including reduced driving voltage and an external quantum efficiency (EQE) exceeding 25% across a wide luminance range.</p><p>The research team's approach focuses on smoothing out energy disorders at the quantum dot/hole transport layer interface, a critical factor in enhancing device performance. This method not only facilitates more efficient hole injection but also accelerates the radiative recombination of excitons, leading to better carrier injection balance and reduced heat accumulation. As a result, the CdZnSe-based QLEDs exhibit an exceptional operational lifetime, surpassing 70,000 hours at 1,000 cd m-2, a substantial improvement over existing technologies.</p><p>This advancement holds profound implications for the future of display and lighting technologies. By addressing key limitations such as heat generation and operational stability, these QLEDs could enable the development of more efficient and durable electronic displays. Published in Light Science & Applications, the research underscores the potential for this technology to revolutionize not only QLEDs but also other photoelectric devices, marking a pivotal moment in the evolution of display and lighting solutions.</p>
