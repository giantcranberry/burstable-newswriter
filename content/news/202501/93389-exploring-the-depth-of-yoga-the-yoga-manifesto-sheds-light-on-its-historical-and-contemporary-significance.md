This book delves into the essence of yoga, questioning its purpose and relevance in today's world, while tracing its journey from ancient Indian traditions to its current global phenomenon.</p><p>Akers, a seasoned yoga practitioner and Sanskrit scholar, brings a unique perspective to the discussion, enriched by his early start in yoga at the age of twelve and his proficiency in Sanskrit by seventeen. His work explores the multifaceted relationships between yoga and various aspects of modern life, including money, religion, and science, offering readers a nuanced understanding beyond the popularized versions of yoga seen today.</p><p>Endorsed by prominent scholars such as Rachel Scott and Dr. Dominik Wujastyk, 'The Yoga Manifesto' is praised for its accessibility, sensibility, and engaging narrative. Dr. Thomas R. Trautmann's description of the book as 'a lovely thing' further underscores its appeal to a broad audience, from practitioners to scholars.</p><p>Available in both paperback and electronic formats, the book is priced at $14.95 and $9.99 respectively, making it an affordable resource for anyone interested in delving deeper into the philosophical and cultural dimensions of yoga. Akers' background, including his translation of the Hatha Yoga Pradipika, lends credibility and depth to this comprehensive work.</p><p>'The Yoga Manifesto' stands out as a scholarly yet accessible examination of yoga's evolution, offering insights into its significance across different cultures and epochs. It is poised to become an essential read for those seeking to understand the profound depth and transformative potential of yoga beyond its physical practice.</p>
