<p>Miles Everson, CEO of MBO Partners, has authored 'Free Birds Revolution: The Future of Work & the Independent Mind', a pivotal exploration into the shifting dynamics of the workforce. The book delves into six key forces driving change: accelerating change, deflationary progress, fractionalization, knowledge flows, talent competition, and the state of independence in America. Everson posits that the surge in independent professionals signifies a profound revolution in work paradigms, not merely a fleeting trend.</p><p>Everson's work serves as a dual guide for individuals and corporations. It equips professionals with strategies to foster resilience, authenticity, and continuous learning, while advising businesses on attracting and leveraging independent talent to address labor shortages and spur innovation. The book has garnered acclaim from industry leaders, with Daniel H. Pink praising it as a guide to the independent workforce revolution, and Elaine Pofeldt endorsing it as essential reading for those entering independent work.</p><p>With 72 million independent workers in the U.S., 'Free Birds Revolution' tackles critical issues like the changing employer-employee social contract and the mutual benefits of independence for individuals and organizations. Everson's analysis is especially relevant as the post-pandemic world reevaluates traditional employment models, advocating for a work culture that values freedom, growth, and adaptability.</p><p>'Free Birds Revolution' stands as both a manifesto and a practical manual, urging a reevaluation of independence as a strategic career move. Everson's insights encourage a reimagining of professional potential in an economy that increasingly favors flexibility and innovation.</p>
