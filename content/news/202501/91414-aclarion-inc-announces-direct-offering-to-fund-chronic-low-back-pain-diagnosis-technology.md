<p>Aclarion, Inc. (Nasdaq: ACON, ACONW), a healthcare technology company specializing in chronic low back pain diagnosis, has announced a registered direct offering of common stock aiming to raise approximately $480,000. The company is set to sell 3,380,276 shares at $0.142 each, with the offering priced at the market and expected to close around January 6, 2025. This strategic move is designed to bolster several critical areas of Aclarion's operations, including market development, clinical evidence gathering, product development, and quality enhancements, alongside general administrative and corporate purposes.</p><p>At the heart of Aclarion's innovation is Nociscan, a Software as a Service (SaaS) platform that leverages Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS), proprietary signal processing, and augmented intelligence algorithms to assist physicians in identifying painful discs in the lumbar spine. This technology marks a pivotal advancement in addressing chronic low back pain, a condition that plagues millions globally. By analyzing MRS data from lumbar disc MRI scans, Nociscan utilizes cloud-based algorithms to process chemical biomarkers linked to disc pain, offering physicians valuable insights into the potential origins of a patient's discomfort. Such data is crucial for tailoring effective treatment plans and enhancing patient outcomes.</p><p>Dawson James Securities, Inc. serves as the sole placement agent for this offering, which is conducted under a shelf registration statement on Form S-3, effective as of September 23, 2024, by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

With additional resources, the company aims to broaden its clinical evidence base, refine its product offerings, and solidify its stance in the chronic low back pain diagnosis market.</p><p>The chronic low back pain sector presents a vast opportunity, driven by the condition's widespread prevalence and the diagnostic hurdles it presents. Aclarion's Nociscan platform seeks to mitigate these challenges by delivering objective, data-centric insights that complement existing diagnostic methodologies. However, investments in medical technology come with inherent risks, including those related to product development, regulatory approvals, and market acceptance. Aclarion cautions that forward-looking statements in their announcement are subject to various uncertainties that could influence actual outcomes.</p><p>For further details on the offering, interested parties can access the prospectus supplement and accompanying prospectus on the SEC's website at <a href='https://www.sec.gov' rel='nofollow' target='_blank'>https://www.sec.gov</a>.
