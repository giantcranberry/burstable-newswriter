<p>Jack Lombardi, known for his conservative entrepreneurship and previous candidacy for Congress in Illinois, is now considering a run for Florida's 19th Congressional District. This move is motivated by Florida's educational policies and its conservative political environment, which Lombardi finds conducive to his values and business interests. His relocation to Florida was driven by a desire for lower taxes, reduced crime rates, and an educational system free from what he terms a 'woke agenda', alongside personal reasons to be near his family during his father's health decline.</p><p>Lombardi's political activism in Illinois, particularly his opposition to Governor JB Pritzker's COVID-19 policies, showcases his readiness to challenge established political figures and policies. His potential candidacy in Florida's 19th District is contingent on the current representative, Byron Donalds, possibly not seeking re-election. Lombardi's entrepreneurial background, starting with Lombardi Trucking at 22 and his early business ventures, underscores his business acumen and understanding of economic issues.</p><p>The consideration of a congressional run by Lombardi is indicative of the broader political shifts in Florida, a state increasingly seen as a haven for conservatives. His story reflects the growing trend of individuals and families moving to Florida for its perceived freedoms and opportunities, potentially influencing the political landscape and policy directions in the state and beyond.</p>
