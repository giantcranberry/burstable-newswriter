<p>UGI Utilities, Inc. is set to initiate a major gas main replacement project in Emmaus, targeting several critical streets within the community. Starting January 14 and expected to wrap up by early May, this initiative focuses on West Greenleaf Street, North 7th Street, West Berger Street, Franklin Street, North Street, and 6th Street. The construction will take place from Monday to Friday, 7 am to 5 pm, likely causing some disruptions to local traffic and parking.</p><p>Residents and businesses in the affected areas should prepare for possible road closures, detours, and temporary traffic delays. UGI Utilities has indicated that interruptions to natural gas service are unavoidable, as property access will be necessary for equipment inspection and relighting. Despite these short-term inconveniences, the project underscores UGI's dedication to ensuring the safety and reliability of its utility infrastructure.</p><p>Moreover, this infrastructure upgrade offers an opportunity for certain properties to switch to natural gas service, which could provide long-term advantages for property owners in the area. The project's timeline is subject to change, depending on weather conditions and other operational factors. UGI Utilities, serving over 760,000 customers, remains committed to investing in infrastructure enhancements across its service territories.</p>
