<p>HIVE Digital Technologies has announced a $30 million investment in Nvidia's H100 and H200 GPU clusters, a strategic move aimed at bolstering its artificial intelligence (AI) and high-performance computing (HPC) capabilities. This investment is expected to position HIVE as a significant player in the tech industry's rapidly evolving AI sector.</p><p>The H100 cluster, consisting of 248 GPUs across nearly three-dozen nodes, is projected to be operational by the end of 2024, with HIVE anticipating a run-rate revenue of $15 million for its HPC business unit shortly after deployment. The H200 cluster, featuring over 500 GPUs across 64 nodes, is set for deployment in Q1 2025, with the potential to generate an annualized run-rate revenue exceeding $20 million by Q2 2025.</p><p>This investment comes amidst a surge in generative AI's popularity, with tech giants and startups alike pouring billions into AI development. HIVE's dual-revenue model, which combines digital currency mining with HPC hosting, is poised to benefit significantly from this venture. The company projects that its HPC services alone could achieve an annualized run-rate revenue of $20 million by Q2 2025, driven by high-margin cloud computing and AI model training services.</p><p>HIVE's commitment to sustainability, with plans to power its AI initiatives using 100% renewable energy, may attract environmentally conscious investors. The company has set an ambitious revenue target of $100 million by 2025 through its HPC services and Bitcoin mining data center conversion, contingent on market conditions and strategic execution.</p><p>As the demand for AI and HPC services continues to grow, HIVE's investment in Nvidia's advanced GPU technology could play a pivotal role in the company's growth and its influence on the future of the AI industry.</p>
