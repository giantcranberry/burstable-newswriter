With support for over 120 languages, including Arabic, French, and Japanese, the platform enables creators to vastly extend their reach to international audiences.</p><p>This technology has wide-ranging applications across different fields. Businesses can use it to connect with global markets, while educational institutions can develop multilingual learning materials, thereby democratizing access to knowledge for speakers of various languages. The tool's ability to eliminate language barriers allows creators to disseminate their content more efficiently on a worldwide stage.</p><p>In addition to video translation, Mango AI provides other creative solutions such as generating talking pet videos, creating singing photos, and developing custom avatars. These features equip creators with unique methods to craft captivating and interactive multimedia content.</p><p>Winston Zhang, CEO of Mango AI, highlighted the platform's fundamental goal: to ensure that content creation is not hindered by geographical or linguistic limitations.
