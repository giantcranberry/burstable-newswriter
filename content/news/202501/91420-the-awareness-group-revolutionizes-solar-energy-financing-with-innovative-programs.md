<p>The solar energy industry is undergoing a transformative phase with The Awareness Group (TAG) introducing innovative financing solutions designed to broaden access to solar power for American households. TAG's Non-FICO Driven Residential Lease program, launched in July, has already made significant strides by eliminating the traditional credit score requirement, a move that has opened up solar energy to a previously underserved market segment. With 475 solar projects signed, totaling $36.9 million in contract value, the program's success is undeniable.</p><p>Further enhancing accessibility, TAG has rolled out a 30-year loan option available in 26 states, characterized by no dealer fees, which could reduce project costs for homeowners by up to 40%. This initiative, coupled with the Non-FICO Driven Lease, aligns with the Solar Energy Industries Association's forecast of a 10% average annual growth rate for the U.S. residential solar market from 2025 to 2028. By 2030, the number of residential solar systems in the U.S. is expected to more than double, reaching 10 million.</p><p>TAG's efforts are particularly impactful given the current disparity in solar adoption rates among low and moderate-income households, which constitute 43% of U.S. households but only 15% of solar adopters. By removing credit score barriers and offering more flexible financing options, TAG is not only expanding its market reach but also playing a pivotal role in the nation's transition towards renewable energy. Additionally, TAG's strategic partnership with Apollo Solar and Battery marks its foray into the commercial solar sector, further solidifying its position as a key player in the solar energy industry.</p><p>The implications of TAG's initiatives extend beyond immediate financial benefits for homeowners. By democratizing access to solar energy, TAG is contributing to the reduction of carbon footprints and fostering a more sustainable future. As the solar energy industry continues to evolve, TAG's innovative financing solutions are set to have a lasting impact on both the market and the environment.</p>
