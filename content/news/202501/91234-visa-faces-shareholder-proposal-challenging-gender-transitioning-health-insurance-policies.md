<p>The National Legal and Policy Center (NLPC) is set to present a shareholder proposal at Visa's annual meeting, questioning the company's health insurance policies concerning gender-transitioning treatments. This move aims to scrutinize potential risks and disparities in compensation for employees undergoing such medical procedures. Claire Abernathy, a detransitioner, will share her personal journey with gender-related medical interventions at the meeting, shedding light on the rapid progression from therapy to significant body-altering surgeries she experienced starting at the age of 12.</p><p>The NLPC's proposal specifically targets various medical procedures covered under Visa's CIGNA health insurance, including mastectomies and other gender-affirming surgeries, which Paul Chesser of NLPC's Corporate Integrity Project labels as 'radical medical experiments.' This initiative not only raises questions about the ethical and legal implications of such healthcare coverage but also aligns with broader concerns over corporate governance and healthcare policies. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission's stance on discrimination based on gender identity adds a layer of complexity to the debate, as does the Securities and Exchange Commission's recognition of de-transitioning individuals within these considerations.</p><p>Abernathy's call for comprehensive healthcare underscores the need for policies that acknowledge all outcomes of gender transitioning treatments, advocating for equitable access to necessary care. This proposal is part of NLPC's wider campaign, having previously addressed similar concerns at other corporate giants like Johnson & Johnson and PepsiCo, signaling a growing scrutiny of healthcare policies in the corporate sector.</p>
