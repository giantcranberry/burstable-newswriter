<p>Avant Technologies, Inc. has embarked on a strategic partnership with Ainnova Tech, Inc., facilitated through Ai-nova Acquisition Corp. (AAC), to support the latter in preparing for a pivotal U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) clinical study. This collaboration focuses on Ainnova's innovative Vision AI platform, designed for early disease detection using artificial intelligence. The initial phase of this partnership targets the development of a platform for the early detection of diabetic retinopathy, with ambitions to extend this technology to other vital health screenings.</p><p>The regulatory journey begins with Ainnova scheduling a pre-submission meeting with the FDA anticipated in late March or early April 2025. This meeting is a critical step for medical device applicants, as it outlines the clinical testing requirements necessary for securing FDA 510(k) clearance, which would permit the marketing of the Vision AI platform in the United States. For Avant Technologies, this process is instrumental in defining a precise budget for navigating the FDA regulatory pathway.</p><p>Looking beyond diabetic retinopathy, Ainnova has outlined plans to seek FDA clearance for four additional algorithms. These algorithms are aimed at the early detection of cardiovascular risk, prediabetes and Type 2 diabetes, fatty liver disease, and chronic kidney disease. This expansion underscores the potential of artificial intelligence in transforming proactive healthcare solutions, positioning both companies as leaders in medical technology innovation. The implications of this partnership extend far beyond the immediate regulatory milestones, offering a glimpse into a future where early disease detection could significantly enhance patient outcomes and reduce healthcare costs.</p>
