<p>Patents to Retail has recently introduced the Eclipse Adjustable Sunshade to its portfolio, showcasing its dedication to turning inventors' concepts into commercial successes. This launch is part of the company's broader mission, which has already seen over 500 products developed, with 30 currently active in the market. The company stands out by providing tailored services that assist inventors from the initial idea phase through to product launch, distinguishing itself from conventional invention promotion firms.</p><p>With a president who holds 20 U.S. patents, Patents to Retail offers inventors two distinct routes to bring their products to market: licensing agreements or direct manufacturing and distribution. The licensing route involves the company pitching products to potential industry partners, allowing inventors to earn royalties without relinquishing patent ownership. On the other hand, the manufacturing and distribution option ensures quick market access, with products guaranteed placement on leading retail platforms such as <a href="https://www.amazon.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://www.walmart.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Walmart</a>.</p><p>The company's services encompass a wide range of support, including idea assessment, prototype development, market analysis, licensing discussions, and promotional assistance. A key aspect of their methodology is the emphasis on rigorous product testing and research to guarantee quality and market viability before launch. This meticulous approach is applied across various product categories, including home goods, baby items, sports gear, and mobile accessories, leveraging both established retail connections and digital marketing strategies.</p><p>The introduction of the Eclipse Adjustable Sunshade is a testament to Patents to Retail's ongoing commitment to fostering innovation and delivering new solutions to the global market. By offering inventors a clear pathway from conception to commercialization, the company plays a pivotal role in bridging the gap between inventive ideas and consumer products, potentially reshaping how inventions reach the marketplace.</p>
