<p>WagerWire, a pioneering sports betting and technology startup, is set to revolutionize conference programming at ICE Barcelona through the introduction of the Startup Pulse show. This innovative initiative, developed in partnership with Clarion Gaming Digital brand iGB, is designed to spotlight emerging entrepreneurs in the gaming industry, providing them with a platform to present their groundbreaking ideas and share their entrepreneurial journeys.</p><p>The Startup Pulse show will feature three unique segments aimed at engaging and educating attendees. The 'Reverse Pitch' segment turns the traditional pitch model on its head, with startup founders judging established CEOs as they present their business concepts. This segment promises to offer fresh insights into industry innovation and challenge conventional thinking.</p><p>Another highlight, 'Moments of Ethos, Mythos, Chaos', will see founders such as WagerWire's Travis Geiger and Karolina Pelc from BeyondPlay sharing personal stories of the challenges and successes they've encountered. This segment aims to shed light on the human aspect of startup culture, emphasizing the resilience and creativity required to build a successful business.</p><p>Adding a lighter touch to the program, 'ICE Confidential' will engage attendees with an interactive trivia game focused on industry jargon and insider knowledge, offering both entertainment and education.</p><p>Travis Geiger, co-founder of WagerWire, will also take the stage to deliver a keynote address titled 'Don't Build a Brand, Build a Community Channel'. His presentation will delve into how businesses can foster stronger customer relationships, enhance loyalty, and boost revenue by prioritizing community engagement.</p><p>Since its inception in 2021, WagerWire has rapidly established itself as a key innovator in the sports betting and gaming technology sector, drawing investment from high-profile figures like NBA All-Star Richard Jefferson. The Startup Pulse show, running from January 20 to January 22, 2025, at ICE Barcelona's stand 5Q30, underscores WagerWire's commitment to supporting and showcasing new talent in the gaming industry, marking a significant step forward in nurturing the next generation of industry leaders.</p>
