<p>Wytec International has achieved a pivotal milestone by securing a multi-state government Master Services Agreement (MSA) via the TXShare Cooperative Purchasing Program. This agreement facilitates the widespread deployment of Wytec's advanced AI gunshot detection technology across public sector organizations, including more than 170 US cities, 50 counties, and over 40 special districts such as transit authorities, police departments, and school districts.</p><p>The technology's standout feature is its exceptional accuracy, backed by over 750,000 lab trials, showcasing a 94% true positive and 95% true negative accuracy rate. This positions Wytec's solution among the most reliable gunshot detection systems worldwide. The development of this technology was made possible through partnerships with Trabus Technologies, which provided an embedded AI/ML software solution for threat detection, and Lemko Corporation, which supplied a secure wireless backbone using Private LTE systems and mobile edge computing technologies.</p><p>Wytec is offering a no-cost Proof of Concept demonstration to select TXShare members, underscoring the company's confidence in its technology. With plans to transition to the Nasdaq Capital Markets and ongoing discussions with chipset manufacturers for potential technology integration into smart modules for commercial telecom operators, Wytec is solidifying its position as a leader in public safety technology.</p><p>This contract not only represents a significant achievement for Wytec but also highlights the critical role of AI technologies in improving public safety and security infrastructure across various governmental and institutional settings. The implications of this development are far-reaching, offering enhanced safety measures and potentially saving lives through early detection and response to gun-related incidents.</p>
