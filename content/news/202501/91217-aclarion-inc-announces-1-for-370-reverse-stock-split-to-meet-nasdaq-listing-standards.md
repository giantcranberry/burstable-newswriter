<p>Aclarion, Inc., a healthcare technology company focused on chronic low back pain diagnostics, has announced a 1-for-370 reverse stock split of its common stock, effective January 29, 2025. This strategic move is designed to meet Nasdaq's continued listing standards by potentially increasing the company's per-share stock price above the minimum $1.00 threshold.</p><p>Approved by stockholders on December 31, 2024, and set by the Board of Directors, the reverse stock split will combine every 370 issued shares into a single share of common stock. This adjustment is part of the company's efforts to maintain its listing on the Nasdaq exchange, with the amendment to its Certificate of Incorporation filed with the Delaware Secretary of State, effective January 28, 2025.</p><p>The reverse stock split will have a proportional impact on outstanding warrants, stock options, and restricted stock units, with adjustments made to conversion and exercise prices to preserve the securities' existing economic value. Shareholders with brokerage accounts will see automatic adjustments, while those holding physical stock certificates will receive instructions from Vstock Transfer, the company's transfer agent.</p><p>Post-split, Aclarion expects to reduce its outstanding common shares from approximately 185 million to around 500,000, without issuing fractional shares. Shareholders owning fewer than 370 shares will receive one whole share. The company will introduce a new CUSIP number (655187300) for the split-adjusted shares, which are scheduled to begin trading on January 29, 2025.</p><p>This financial maneuver underscores the challenges and strategies small-cap companies may employ to comply with stock exchange listing requirements, highlighting the importance of stock price in maintaining market presence and investor confidence.</p>
