The curriculum covers essential topics such as the preparation and submission of family-based immigration applications, current regulations, and best practices for client communication. A unique feature of the program is its emphasis on practical skills, offering participants hands-on experience through interactive modules and real-world scenarios.</p><p>Ethical standards and consumer protection are central to the program, with a focus on preventing the unauthorized practice of law and promoting professional integrity. LAIA also provides graduates with resources to support career advancement and business growth, including access to a membership benefits program that offers ongoing support and tools for establishing independent document preparation services.</p><p>This initiative by LAIA marks a significant advancement in professionalizing the field of immigration document preparation.
