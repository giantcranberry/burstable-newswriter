<p>UGI Utilities has recently issued a set of recommendations aimed at helping customers conserve energy and manage utility costs effectively during an expected prolonged spell of extremely cold weather. The utility company's advice focuses on practical strategies that not only aim to reduce energy consumption but also ensure that households remain comfortable and safe during these challenging conditions.</p><p>Among the key suggestions are adjusting thermostat settings to two or three degrees lower than usual, scheduling the use of large appliances outside of peak hours, and refraining from using natural gas fireplaces unnecessarily. These measures are designed to help customers save on energy costs while also contributing to the stability of the energy grid during periods of high demand.</p><p>Further recommendations include enhancing home efficiency by sealing drafts around windows and doors, making the most of natural sunlight by keeping curtains open during the day, and staying warm through the use of layered clothing and blankets. These steps not only aid in energy conservation but also in maintaining personal comfort without over-reliance on heating systems.</p><p>UGI Utilities also highlights the critical importance of safety during extreme weather conditions. The company has assured that its response teams are prepared to address any service disruptions swiftly. Customers are reminded to stay safe by keeping a safe distance from downed power lines and to evacuate immediately if they detect the smell of natural gas, emphasizing the need to move a considerable distance away before contacting emergency services.</p><p>By following these energy conservation and safety recommendations, customers can play a part in reducing their utility bills, supporting the energy grid's reliability, and ensuring their well-being during the winter months. This initiative by UGI Utilities underscores the broader implications of collective energy conservation efforts in mitigating the impact of extreme weather on both individual households and the community at large.</p>
