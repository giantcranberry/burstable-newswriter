<p>The National Applied Research Laboratories (NARLabs) led a significant delegation to the Semi Impact Forum 2024 in Barcelona, Spain, marking a pivotal moment for Taiwan's semiconductor industry on the global stage. The event, held on December 9, 2024, served as a crucial platform for Taiwan to demonstrate its semiconductor ecosystem's strength and to explore collaborative opportunities with European counterparts in advanced chip technologies.</p><p>Dr. Mei-Yu Chang, Director of the Office of International Affairs at NARLabs, spearheaded the delegation, which included key figures from Taiwan's semiconductor sector. The forum not only highlighted Taiwan's achievements in building a comprehensive semiconductor ecosystem but also its potential for forming global partnerships that could shape the future of technology.</p><p>Professor Konrad Young, a former R&D Director at TSMC and renowned as one of the 'Six Knights of Innovation,' delivered the keynote address. He shared Taiwan's innovative approach to talent development and ecosystem building, with TSMC's success story serving as a prime example. His dialogue with Dr. Jos√© A. Garrido from the Catalan Institute of Nanoscience and Nanotechnology (ICN2) offered valuable insights into Taiwan's model, suggesting it as a blueprint for other nations.</p><p>The forum also facilitated technical exchanges among experts from NARLabs, the National Center for High-performance Computing (NCHC), INESC TEC in Portugal, and the Barcelona Supercomputing Center (BSC). These discussions spanned cutting-edge topics like distributed systems, quantum computing, and IoT infrastructure, setting the stage for future collaborations.</p><p>A standout moment was the presentation of the Advanced Chip Design and Research Center (ACDRC), a collaborative project between Taiwan and the Czech Republic. This initiative underscores Taiwan's role in fostering semiconductor talent and innovation internationally. Dr. Chang highlighted the ACDRC's significance in enhancing Taiwan-Czech cooperation and its potential to inspire similar partnerships across Europe.</p><p>Light Momentum Technology (LMT), represented by CTO Dr. Kuan-Jung Chen, illustrated how the ACDRC platform effectively merges IC design and manufacturing with market-driven innovation. LMT's contributions have bolstered the semiconductor capabilities of both Taiwan and the Czech Republic, addressing evolving market needs.</p><p>The forum provided a global platform for the ACDRC to showcase its achievements and scalability. NARLabs expressed its dedication to expanding collaborations with Spain, the Czech Republic, and other European countries, signaling Taiwan's eagerness to establish new international alliances in the semiconductor field.</p><p>This event highlights the indispensable role of international cooperation in pushing the boundaries of semiconductor technology. With the industry navigating challenges and opportunities in AI, automotive electronics, and IoT, initiatives like the ACDRC are vital for fostering innovation and sustaining global competitiveness.</p><p>The Taiwan delegation's success at the Semi Impact Forum 2024 not only cements Taiwan's leadership in the semiconductor industry but also paves the way for enhanced knowledge exchange and technological progress. As the ACDRC continues to drive innovation and market expansion, it is set to fortify Taiwan's global semiconductor presence and influence future industry developments.</p>
