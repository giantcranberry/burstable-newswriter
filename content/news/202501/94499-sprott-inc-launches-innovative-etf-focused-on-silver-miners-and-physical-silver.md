<p>Sprott Inc. has unveiled the Sprott Silver Miners & Physical Silver ETF (NASDAQ: SLVR), a novel investment vehicle designed to offer investors focused exposure to silver miners and physical silver. This ETF emerges at a time when silver's industrial demand, especially in green economy applications, is witnessing unprecedented growth. The Silver Institute's recent findings indicate a 7% increase in industrial silver demand in 2024, exceeding 700 million ounces for the first time, largely fueled by its use in solar panels and electric vehicles.</p><p>What sets SLVR apart is its exclusive focus on companies primarily engaged in silver mining, eschewing those where silver is a by-product. Sprott claims this strategy affords investors double the exposure to silver compared to broader mining ETF approaches. This targeted investment comes as silver's market dynamics appear favorable. Historical trends show silver prices often surge during periods of economic recovery, lower interest rates, and currency devaluation, with silver rallies historically outpacing gold's by a factor of two.</p><p>The Silver Institute's World Silver Survey 2024 sheds light on the complex supply chain of silver, noting that only 28.3% of silver is sourced from primary mines. This complexity highlights the strategic advantage of SLVR's focused investment approach. As the global economy shifts towards sustainable, low-carbon technologies, silver's role in the new energy ecosystem is becoming increasingly vital. The Sprott Silver Miners & Physical Silver ETF presents a unique opportunity for investors to engage with this shift, leveraging silver's rising industrial and strategic significance.</p>
