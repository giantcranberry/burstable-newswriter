<p>Comcast has announced a major expansion of its fiber broadband network in Northern California, specifically targeting Butte and Colusa counties. This initiative is set to connect over 705 previously unserved residential and commercial locations by 2026, thanks to an $8 million Federal Funding Account (FFA) Grant from the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) and private investment. The project is a significant step towards bridging the digital divide in these rural areas, with 260 locations in Colusa County and 445 in Butte County set to benefit.</p><p>State Senator Megan Dahle highlighted the transformative potential of this expansion, pointing out its capacity to unlock educational, healthcare, and economic opportunities for local communities. Comcast's efforts are not limited to infrastructure; the company has a longstanding commitment to digital inclusion, exemplified by its Internet Essentials program, which has connected over 2.2 million Californians since 2011. Additionally, Comcast has invested more than $130 million in digital skill-building and connectivity programs over the past three years.</p><p>The new network will deliver multi-gigabit internet speeds with 99.9 percent reliability, offering residents and businesses access to a wide range of digital services through Xfinity and Comcast Business. These services include internet, video, mobile, voice, and home security options, marking a significant upgrade in connectivity for the region.</p><p>Andy Pickett, Butte County's Chief Administrative Officer, praised the investment for its potential to improve the quality of life for residents, especially those near the City of Oroville. David Tashjian, Regional Senior Vice President of Comcast California, reiterated the company's commitment to ensuring digital access for all, emphasizing the role of public-private partnerships in fostering opportunities in the digital age.</p><p>This expansion is part of Comcast's wider strategy to enhance digital connectivity in underserved areas of California, following similar fiber network grants for Tulare, Marin, Sutter, and Madera counties. The project underscores the importance of reliable, high-speed internet as a cornerstone for community development and individual empowerment in today's digital world.</p>
