<p>HNO International Inc. has taken a significant step toward its goal of uplisting on the Nasdaq by engaging a Wall Street investment bank to facilitate a strategic capital raise of up to $20 million. This move underscores the company's commitment to expanding its footprint in the green hydrogen energy sector, a market that is gaining traction as global energy demands continue to escalate.</p><p>Specializing in innovative energy technologies, HNO International is leveraging its Scalable Hydrogen Energy Platform (SHEP™) and Compact Hydrogen Refueling Station (CHRS™) to address the pressing need for sustainable energy solutions. The company's focus on green hydrogen, which is produced using renewable energy sources, positions it as a pioneer in offering clean energy alternatives to energy-intensive industries, including cryptocurrency mining.</p><p>The cryptocurrency mining sector, in particular, presents a unique opportunity for HNO International. With the global Bitcoin mining market expected to reach $8.24 billion by 2034 and its significant electricity consumption, the company's green hydrogen solutions could provide a much-needed sustainable energy source. CEO Donald Owens highlights the advantage of local hydrogen infrastructure, which eliminates the inefficiencies associated with long-distance transportation and energy-intensive liquefaction processes.</p><p>In preparation for its anticipated Nasdaq uplisting by late summer 2025, HNO International has optimized its outstanding share structure to 74 million shares. This strategic adjustment is aimed at enhancing the company's earnings per share and stock valuation, making it more attractive to investors. As the world increasingly prioritizes sustainability, HNO International's innovative approach to green hydrogen energy not only sets it apart in the competitive energy market but also aligns with global efforts to combat climate change through cleaner energy solutions.</p>
