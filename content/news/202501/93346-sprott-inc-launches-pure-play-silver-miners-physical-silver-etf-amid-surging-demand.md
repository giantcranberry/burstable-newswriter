<p>Sprott Inc., a leading North American asset management firm with $33.4 billion in assets under management, has announced the launch of the Sprott Silver Miners & Physical Silver ETF (NASDAQ: SLVR). This new ETF is positioned as the only one providing pure-play exposure to silver miners and physical silver, arriving at a time when the silver market is experiencing significant momentum. In 2024, silver emerged as a top-performing commodity, with a return of 20.58%, driven by surging industrial demand, especially in green economy applications.</p><p>The Silver Institute estimates a 7% rise in industrial demand for silver, surpassing 700 million ounces for the first time. This surge is largely attributed to silver's critical role in electrification technologies, such as solar panels and electric vehicles, enhancing its investment appeal. Traditionally seen as a hedge against inflation with low correlation to other asset classes, silver's importance is further magnified by current macroeconomic conditions. Sprott's analysis suggests that periods of lowered interest rates and decelerating inflation have historically benefited silver prices, with the metal often rallying during times of currency debasement, inflation, falling interest rates, and geopolitical uncertainties.</p><p>The SLVR ETF sets itself apart by focusing exclusively on silver producers, developers, and explorers, avoiding miners where silver is a by-product. This strategy offers investors twice the exposure to silver compared to other mining ETF strategies, according to Sprott. The 2024 World Silver Survey by The Silver Institute highlights that only 28.3% of silver was produced from primary silver mines in 2023, with the majority coming from gold, copper, and lead/zinc operations. This complex supply chain underscores the importance of targeted investment strategies like the SLVR ETF.</p><p>As the global economy shifts towards low-carbon technologies, silver's role is becoming increasingly critical. The SLVR ETF provides investors with a unique opportunity to engage with this emerging economic ecosystem by offering exposure to companies that are actively producing or holding physical silver. This launch is timely, considering the growing industrial demand and investment interest in silver, positioning the SLVR ETF as a potentially valuable tool for investors looking to capitalize on these trends.</p>
