<p>Ocean Thermal Energy Corporation (OTE Corp) has been awarded a $3.5 million contract by Johnson Controls to design and evaluate a groundbreaking Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion (OTEC) system for the U.S. Army Garrison at Kwajalein Atoll. This project, aiming to deploy a 17.5MW system, utilizes the natural temperature differences in ocean water to produce clean, continuous power and desalinated water, offering a sustainable energy solution for remote military installations.</p><p>The collaboration between OTE Corp, Johnson Controls, and DCO Energy focuses on developing a comprehensive system design that includes project load analysis, conceptual engineering, and cost estimation. This initiative is built on the success of previous projects, such as a seawater cooling system for a Bahamian resort and a 7.5 MW OTEC conceptual design for Bahamas Power and Light, showcasing the potential of OTEC technology in diverse applications.</p><p>Key objectives of the project include validating the feasibility of OTEC systems for remote military bases, demonstrating the system's reliability and scalability, and working closely with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to meet specific operational needs. Additionally, the project will explore the desalination capabilities of the OTEC system, addressing both energy and water resilience challenges at Kwajalein Atoll.</p><p>Jeremy P. Feakins, Chairman and CEO of OTE Corp, highlighted the project's importance, stating that the partnership with Johnson Controls underscores the transformative potential of OTEC technology in bolstering operational resilience and integrating renewable energy into national defense strategies. This initiative is a pivotal move towards reducing the reliance of military installations on imported fossil fuels, providing a sustainable and reliable energy solution in geographically challenging environments.</p>
