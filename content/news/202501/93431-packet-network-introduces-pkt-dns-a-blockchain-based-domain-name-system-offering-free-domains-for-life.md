<p>Packet Network has launched PKT DNS, a revolutionary blockchain-based domain name system that offers users the opportunity to own domains for life without any cost. This system operates on the Base blockchain and is designed to be open and resistant to censorship, connecting blockchain domains directly to the public internet without the need for special software or browser extensions.</p><p>What distinguishes PKT DNS from traditional domain name systems is its use of a third-level subdomain system. This allows users to select a name that precedes the .pkt second-level domain, with the added benefit of global accessibility. Domains registered through PKT DNS are broadcast to over 55 top-level domains, ensuring they can be used seamlessly across the internet. This innovative approach effectively bridges the gap between blockchain technology and conventional internet infrastructure.</p><p>The ownership model of PKT DNS is another area where it diverges from traditional systems. Instead of requiring upfront fees and annual renewals, PKT DNS users stake a small amount of PKT cryptocurrency on the Base blockchain to register a domain. This staking process creates an NFT that acts as a digital receipt for the domain, with the staked amount remaining under the user's control and retrievable if the domain is relinquished. This model not only democratizes domain ownership but also introduces a novel use case for cryptocurrency in everyday internet use.</p><p>PKT DNS also incorporates mechanisms to prevent misuse, including blacklisting capabilities and flexible name server options for operators. These features ensure the system remains safe and reliable for all users, balancing innovation with responsible operation.</p><p>As part of Packet Network's broader vision to create a decentralized media network, PKT DNS represents a significant step forward. Built on the cjdns mesh networking protocol, the network aims to provide an alternative to corporate-controlled internet infrastructure, empowering content creators worldwide. The PKT cryptocurrency plays a central role in this ecosystem, incentivizing users to participate in the network's infrastructure through a Stake-to-Earn protocol.</p><p>The introduction of PKT DNS could have profound implications for internet freedom, content creation, and digital distribution. By offering a censorship-resistant, globally accessible domain name system, PKT DNS challenges the status quo and paves the way for a more open and decentralized internet.
