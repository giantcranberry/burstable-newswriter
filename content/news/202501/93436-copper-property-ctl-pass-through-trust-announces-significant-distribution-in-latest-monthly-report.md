<p>The Copper Property CTL Pass Through Trust has announced a substantial distribution of $24.2 million, or $0.322926 per trust certificate, in its monthly report for the period ending December 31, 2024. This distribution is scheduled for payment on January 10, 2025, to certificateholders of record as of January 9, 2025, underscoring the trust's progress in monetizing properties acquired from J.C. Penney during its Chapter 11 reorganization.</p><p>Established to manage and liquidate 160 retail properties and 6 warehouse distribution centers formerly owned by J.C. Penney, the trust's primary goal is to sell these assets to third-party purchasers swiftly, with proceeds distributed to certificateholders. The recent filing via Form 8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) provides investors and analysts with vital information on the trust's performance and liquidation progress. Additional details, including Monthly and Quarterly Reports, are accessible through the trust's website at <a href='https://www.ctltrust.net' rel='nofollow' target='_blank'>https://www.ctltrust.net</a>.</p><p>Operating under a unique structure with GLAS Trust Company LLC as the Trustee and an affiliate of Hilco Real Estate LLC managing the trust externally, the arrangement aims to enhance liquidation efficiency and value return to certificateholders. This initiative mirrors wider trends in the retail real estate sector, where traditional locations are being reassessed and repurposed, highlighting the sector's health and adaptability post-retail industry restructuring.</p><p>For tax purposes, the trust is classified as a liquidating trust under United States Treasury Regulation Section 301.7701-4(d), affecting the tax treatment of distributions for investors. Despite the positive distribution news, the trust cautions that future performance is subject to risks and uncertainties, with actual results potentially differing from projections.</p><p>The trust's activities and monthly reports are closely watched by investors and market observers for insights into the liquidation of a significant retail and distribution property portfolio. Its performance may also signal broader trends in the recovery and transformation of retail real estate assets in the evolving post-pandemic economy.</p>
