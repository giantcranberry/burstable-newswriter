<p>IntusCare, a leader in predictive analytics for geriatric care, has successfully raised $11.5 million in strategic follow-on financing, bringing its total funding to over $27 million. This investment round, spearheaded by Deerfield Management with contributions from Citi Impact Fund and Jumpstart Nova, reflects a robust confidence in IntusCare's innovative solutions for senior healthcare. The funds are earmarked for the introduction of CareHub, a pioneering care management platform aimed at streamlining operations in Programs of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly (PACE) and similar value-based care models.</p><p>CareHub is designed to alleviate administrative pressures, unify fragmented data systems, and deliver practical insights for care teams. Robbie Felton, CEO and co-founder of IntusCare, highlighted the platform's role in advancing care for seniors with intricate health needs. Although initially focused on PACE programs, IntusCare has plans to extend its offerings to Accountable Care Organizations and Special Needs Plans, broadening its impact on senior healthcare.</p><p>The investment not only underscores the escalating significance of technology in healthcare but also its potential to revolutionize care for the elderly. Ryan Alam of the Citi Impact Fund pointed out how IntusCare's technology could empower providers with sophisticated administrative, financial, and clinical tools. Dr. Julian Harris from Deerfield Management commended the company's innovative, AI-driven strategy, anticipating substantial benefits across various healthcare markets.</p><p>Originating from a 2019 initiative by Brown University students, IntusCare has quickly established itself as a key player in geriatric care technology. The company is dedicated to enhancing care for dual-eligible seniors, a group facing significant clinical and social challenges within the U.S. healthcare system. This funding will fuel further product development, market expansion, and AI research, aiming to refine the healthcare experience for providers and patients alike.</p>
