<p>Aramco and CoorsTek Membrane Sciences have entered into a collaborative agreement aimed at commercializing advanced metal-ceramic membrane technology, a move that could significantly reduce carbon emissions in energy-intensive industries. This partnership is centered around the development of catalytic membrane reformers capable of converting hydrocarbons into carbon dioxide (CO2) and hydrogen (H2), thereby enabling CO2 capture and storage while producing hydrogen as a decarbonized energy carrier.</p><p>Ali A. Al-Meshari, Senior Vice President of Technology Oversight & Coordination at Aramco, highlighted the partnership's potential to open new avenues for reducing industrial carbon emissions. The collaboration with CoorsTek Membrane Sciences is expected to fast-track the commercialization of this innovative metal-ceramic membrane technology.</p><p>Aqil Jamal, Carbon Management R&D Chief Technologist at Aramco, pointed out the technology's unique capability to integrate membranes with catalysts, allowing it to exceed traditional equilibrium limits for chemical reactions. This integration significantly lowers the energy required for CO2 separation, marking a substantial advancement in carbon capture technology.</p><p>Per Vestre, Managing Director of CoorsTek Membrane Sciences, underscored the economic benefits of the technology, with techno-economic models indicating that membrane reactors could reduce decarbonization costs for ethylene production by up to 50% compared to other methods such as post-combustion carbon capture.</p><p>This collaboration is a pivotal development in the pursuit of more sustainable industrial processes, offering promising prospects for global initiatives aimed at curbing greenhouse gas emissions and shifting towards cleaner energy technologies.</p>
