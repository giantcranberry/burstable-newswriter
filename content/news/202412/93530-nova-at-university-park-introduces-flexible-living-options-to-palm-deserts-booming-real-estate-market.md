<p>The introduction of Nova at University Park by Woodbridge Pacific Group (WPG) is transforming Palm Desert's real estate landscape, offering homebuyers a variety of flexible living options. With homes ranging from 2,328 to 2,751 square feet and prices starting in the low $700,000s, Nova addresses the needs of diverse households, including empty nesters, first-time buyers, and multi-generational families.</p><p>What distinguishes Nova are its two new casita designs, providing independent living spaces with separate entries. These designs not only offer privacy but also the potential for rental income, appealing to those considering long-term guests or looking to offset mortgage costs. Todd Cunningham, WPG President, highlights the designs' versatility in meeting current and future lifestyle needs.</p><p>Located near the 10 Freeway and Eisenhower Health, Nova's prime location is a draw for healthcare professionals and families alike, with access to reputable school districts such as Desert Sands Unified and Palm Springs Unified. The community is part of the University Park master plan, featuring The Grove, a comprehensive amenity center with resort-style pools and fitness facilities.</p><p>WPG's partnership with US Bank offers buyers financing opportunities, including reduced interest rates and special incentives, with Jeff Weirsma available to assist in navigating these options. Resident testimonials, like those from Rose and Dan Arguin, underscore the community's appeal, praising the homes, location, and WPG's responsive customer service through the Dwelling Live system.</p><p>As the California housing market evolves, Nova at University Park stands out for its innovative approach to meeting diverse housing needs, combining flexible designs, a strategic location, and extensive amenities. This development not only enhances Palm Desert's real estate offerings but also provides a model for addressing the broader challenges of housing affordability and flexibility in the state.</p>
