<p>New Era Helium, Inc. (NEH) has marked a significant milestone by completing its business combination with Roth CH Acquisition V Co., a move that not only enhances its stature in the helium and natural gas production industry but also sets the stage for its shares to trade on the Nasdaq under the symbols 'NEHC' and 'NEHCW'. This development is particularly timely, given the escalating demand for helium, driven largely by the expansion of data centers that power artificial intelligence (AI) technologies.</p><p>With over 137,000 acres in Southeast New Mexico and 1.5 billion cubic feet of proved and probable helium reserves, NEH is strategically positioned to meet this growing demand. The company's Nasdaq listing is expected to elevate its profile among institutional investors, especially those focused on the AI datacenter and helium markets, as highlighted by E. Will Gray II, Chairman and CEO of New Era Helium.</p><p>Further solidifying its market position, NEH has announced a non-binding joint venture with Sharon AI, Inc. to construct a 90MW net-zero Tier 3 data center in the Permian Basin. This initiative leverages Sharon AI's high-performance computing expertise and NEH's helium and natural gas resources, aiming to offset approximately 250,000 metric tons of CO2 annually through carbon capture technology. This partnership not only underscores NEH's commitment to sustainable innovation but also its potential to significantly influence the convergence of energy infrastructure and advanced computing.</p><p>The Nasdaq listing is anticipated to attract U.S. investors keen on energy infrastructure and sustainable innovation, providing NEH with the visibility needed to establish itself as a leading consolidator in the helium and natural gas production sector. As the demand for helium, especially in cooling systems for high-performance computers, continues to grow, NEH's extensive reserves and strategic initiatives position it to benefit from and potentially shape market trends.</p><p>This development represents a pivotal moment for New Era Helium, Inc., as it navigates the evolving landscape of energy resources and technological infrastructure. By bridging traditional natural gas production with cutting-edge AI applications, NEH is setting a new benchmark for innovation in the sector, offering a glimpse into the future of sustainable energy and technology integration.</p>
