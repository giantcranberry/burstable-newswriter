<p>Rogue Space Systems Corporation has recently announced payload hosting opportunities for its Sun-Synchronous Orbit (SSO) mission, OTP-3, set for mid-2026. This initiative provides a unique platform for commercial and research payloads aboard an ESPA-class satellite, featuring an extra mass budget of 40kg, orbit average power over 80 watts, and peak power of 1.2 kilowatts. Such specifications position OTP-3 as an ideal venue for a wide array of space-based experiments and technology demonstrations.</p><p>Brent Abbott, Chief Revenue Officer at Rogue Space Systems, emphasized the potential for an additional spacecraft dedicated to Rendezvous-Proximity Operations and Docking (RPOD), which could further enhance payload hosting capabilities and enable dual satellite mission testing. This mission is a component of Rogue's continuous demonstration and test program, with flights planned every nine months through 2027. The company ensures comprehensive support for hosted payloads, including assembly, integration, testing (AIT), and mission operations, with costs tailored to payload requirements and alignment with Rogue's technological objectives.</p><p>The OTP-3 spacecraft, under 200kg, is outfitted with advanced systems such as precision Attitude and Orbit Control System (AOCS), RPOD capabilities, and a Scalable Compute Platform (SCP) for parallel edge computing. This setup is particularly suited for complex algorithms in AI, image processing, and autonomy, offering customers the chance to host their algorithms on the SCP with access to all sensor data. Additional mission features include onboard storage, X-band downlinking, a multispectral remote sensing instrument, and RPOD situational-awareness tools, all supported by 6DOF RCS thrusters for enhanced agility.</p><p>Rogue Space Systems is at the forefront of developing logistics infrastructure for the burgeoning space economy, with a focus on in-space manufacturing, recycling, and R&D. Their innovative solutions, including Waypoint™ stations, Orbots™, and Orblock™ payload containers, aim to streamline space-based operations and material flow. The OTP-3 mission exemplifies Rogue's commitment to advancing space technology and accessibility, offering a critical platform for testing and deploying new technologies that could drive innovation in Earth observation, communications, and beyond.</p><p>This payload hosting opportunity by Rogue Space Systems not only facilitates access to space for a broader range of entities but also accelerates the pace of technological advancement in the space sector. As the space economy expands, missions like OTP-3 are instrumental in pushing the boundaries of what's possible, fostering a new era of space exploration and utilization.</p>
