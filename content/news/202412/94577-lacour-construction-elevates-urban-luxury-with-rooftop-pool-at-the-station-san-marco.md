<p>LaCour Construction has marked a significant achievement with the completion of a state-of-the-art rooftop pool at The Station @ San Marco in Jacksonville, Florida. This project not only showcases the company's expertise in navigating the complexities of elevated aquatic installations but also reflects the increasing demand for luxury amenities in urban developments.</p><p>The construction of rooftop pools presents unique challenges, including ensuring structural integrity, waterproofing, and managing logistical hurdles in dense urban environments. LaCour Construction addressed these challenges head-on, employing innovative solutions such as beam-and-column systems and lightweight materials to support the pool's weight. Advanced waterproofing techniques, including double membrane systems and liquid-applied barriers, were utilized to prevent leaks and water damage, ensuring the longevity and safety of the structure.</p><p>The rooftop pool at The Station @ San Marco features an infinity edge design, sun shelves, mosaic tile detailing, and stone coping, offering residents a luxurious retreat. With a capacity of 26,949 gallons and a surface area of 1,198 square feet, this amenity is set to enhance the property's appeal and potentially increase its market value.</p><p>This project underscores the importance of specialized construction expertise in the development of urban luxury amenities. As cities continue to densify, the ability to creatively utilize underutilized spaces like rooftops for high-end features becomes increasingly valuable. LaCour Construction's successful completion of this project positions them as a leader in this niche market, ready to meet the growing demand for innovative urban development solutions.</p><p>For more details on LaCour Construction's projects and capabilities, visit <a href='https://lacourconstruction.com' rel='nofollow' target='_blank'>https://lacourconstruction.com</a>.</p>
