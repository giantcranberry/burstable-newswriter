<p>The recent announcement by Custos Energy and its partners regarding the successful results from the Mopane-1A appraisal well in Namibia's Orange Basin marks a pivotal moment for the country's emerging oil and gas sector. This discovery, part of the second exploration and appraisal campaign on Petroleum Exploration License 83 (PEL 83), has identified light oil and gas-condensate in high-quality reservoir sands, reinforcing the area's potential as a significant hydrocarbon resource.</p><p>The PEL 83 joint venture, led by a subsidiary of Portugal's Galp Energia with Custos Energy and NAMCOR holding a 10% working interest, completed drilling the Mopane-1A well on November 28th. The findings from this well, along with previous discoveries in the Mopane-1X and Mopane-2X wells, suggest the presence of an original oil in place (OOIP) estimated at 10 billion barrels of oil equivalent. Such quantities, coupled with the high quality of the reservoirs, indicate a strong potential for commercial exploitation.</p><p>Knowledge Katti, Chairman and CEO of Custos, highlighted the significance of these results, pointing to the Mopane complex's world-class potential. The Namibian government, through Petroleum Commissioner Maggy Shino, has also recognized the discovery as a milestone for the country's energy sector, underscoring the broader national implications of successful oil and gas development.</p><p>With plans to drill additional wells and conduct a high-resolution proprietary 3D seismic campaign in December 2024, the joint venture is poised to further explore and delineate the Orange Basin's resources. These efforts could not only transform Namibia into a notable oil-producing nation but also significantly impact its economic and energy landscape in the years to come.</p><p>The discoveries in the Orange Basin are drawing global attention to Namibia as a potential key player in the oil and gas industry. The favorable characteristics of the finds, including light oil in high-quality reservoirs with good production potential, position the Mopane complex as a cornerstone of Namibia's economic future and a significant contributor to the global energy market.</p>
