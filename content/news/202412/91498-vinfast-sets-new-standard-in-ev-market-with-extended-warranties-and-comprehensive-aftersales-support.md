<p>VinFast is making significant strides in the electric vehicle (EV) market by introducing an industry-leading warranty package and a robust aftersales support system. This move is aimed at addressing consumer concerns and building trust in EV technology, a critical factor in the broader adoption of electric vehicles. The company's 10-year/125,000 mile vehicle warranty and 10-year/unlimited mileage battery warranty far exceed the federal mandate, offering unprecedented peace of mind to EV owners.</p><p>Recent research indicating that EV batteries can last up to 38% longer than initially projected has further bolstered consumer confidence in electric vehicles. VinFast's extended warranties capitalize on this positive trend, with early adopters like VF 8 owners Benoit Naud and Dien Do citing the warranty as a decisive factor in their purchase. As VinFast begins deliveries of its VF 9 model in North America, these warranties are expected to play a crucial role in attracting new customers.</p><p>Beyond warranties, VinFast has developed a comprehensive aftersales support system designed to meet the expectations of modern EV owners. This includes a mobile service program for convenient repairs and maintenance, 24/7 Emergency Roadside Assistance, and a smart app that provides access to over 140,000 charging stations across North America. Customer feedback, such as that from VF 8 owner Natalie Tung, highlights the convenience and efficiency of these services.</p><p>VinFast's customer-centric approach not only addresses the immediate needs of EV owners but also sets a new standard in the automotive industry. As more automakers enter the EV market, the competition spurred by VinFast's initiatives could lead to improved warranty and service offerings across the board, benefiting consumers and accelerating the transition to sustainable transportation. This strategy underscores VinFast's commitment to not just competing in the EV market but also contributing to the evolution of the automotive industry towards electrification.</p>
