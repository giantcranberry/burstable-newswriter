<p>A recent study by HR.com's HR Research Institute, titled 'HR.com's Future of Career Development and Mobility 2024-25', has brought to light significant shortcomings in employee career development programs across organizations. With only 20% of companies achieving the top two levels of program maturity, the findings underscore a critical need for improvement in how organizations support employee growth and development.</p><p>The research reveals that a mere 37% of organizations deem themselves effective in career development, and only 42% report success in internal mobility initiatives. Alarmingly, just 22% provide sufficient development opportunities to meet workforce demands, highlighting a stark gap between employee expectations and employer support. This gap poses a considerable risk to organizations in attracting and retaining top talent in an evolving job market.</p><p>Managers play a pivotal role in employee career development, yet the study uncovers troubling trends: 34% of organizations have managers who discourage internal movement to retain high performers, only 15% equip managers with the necessary development skills, and a scant 10% recognize and reward managers for developing their teams. Debbie McGrath, CEO of HR.com, stresses the importance of empowering managers with the right tools and incentives to foster a more engaged and agile workforce.</p><p>The implications of these findings are profound. Organizations lagging in career development initiatives risk losing talent to competitors and facing skill gaps that could hinder productivity and innovation. To combat these challenges, the study recommends comprehensive manager training, clear career pathways, and a culture that values continuous learning.</p><p>The full report, <a href='https://www.hr.com' rel='nofollow' target='_blank'>HR.com's Future of Career Development and Mobility 2024-25</a>, provides detailed insights and recommendations for enhancing career development strategies. In today's competitive talent landscape, prioritizing employee growth is not just beneficialâ€”it's essential for building a skilled, loyal, and future-ready workforce.</p>
