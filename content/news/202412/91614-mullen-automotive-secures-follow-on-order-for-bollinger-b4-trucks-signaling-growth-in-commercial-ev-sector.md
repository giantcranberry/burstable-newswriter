<p>Mullen Automotive (NASDAQ: MULN) has recently announced a follow-on order for seven all-electric 2025 Bollinger B4 trucks from TEC Equipment, following an initial purchase of three trucks in October 2024. This development not only signifies TEC Equipment's growing confidence in Mullen's EV offerings but also provides an immediate financial boost to the company, with revenue from this order to be recognized in the current fiscal quarter. The B4 trucks are set for delivery across California, Oregon, and Washington, marking an expansion of Mullen's footprint in crucial West Coast markets.</p><p>The Bollinger B4 truck, a Class 4 vehicle, showcases Mullen's dedication to innovation in the commercial EV space. With a remarkable 185-mile range and a payload capacity of 7,394 pounds, the B4 is engineered to meet the rigorous demands of commercial fleets. Its emphasis on safety and efficiency positions it as a compelling choice for businesses aiming to transition to electric vehicles without compromising on operational performance.</p><p>Significantly, the Bollinger B4 qualifies for substantial federal and state tax incentives, which can markedly lower the total cost of ownership for fleet operators. This financial advantage could hasten the adoption of electric vehicles in the commercial sector, aligning with broader environmental and economic objectives.</p><p>Bollinger Motors, under Mullen Automotive's umbrella, has achieved pivotal milestones, including EPA and CARB certifications for the B4 truck. These certifications are essential for the vehicle's sale in strict regulatory environments like California, underscoring its environmental compliance and market readiness.</p><p>The commencement of B4 truck production represents a critical transition for Mullen Automotive from development to manufacturing, enabling the company to address the increasing demand for electric commercial vehicles. Additionally, Mullen has bolstered its commercial dealer network to seven dealers, including Pap√© Kenworth, enhancing its sales and service infrastructure across significant U.S. markets.</p><p>Mullen's strategic advancements are further complemented by the Foreign Trade Zone (FTZ) status awarded to its Tunica, Mississippi, manufacturing center. This status offers considerable benefits, such as duty deferment and elimination on exported vehicles, potentially optimizing the company's cost structure and competitiveness on the global stage.</p><p>This follow-on order from TEC Equipment not only delivers immediate revenue but also serves as a testament to the confidence in Mullen's products and strategic direction. For investors and industry stakeholders, this progression underscores Mullen's emerging influence in the commercial EV domain and its prospects for sustained growth amidst the industry's shift towards electrification.</p>
