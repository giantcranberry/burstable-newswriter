<p>Mullen Automotive (NASDAQ: MULN) has announced a strategic partnership between its subsidiary, Bollinger Motors, and Bergey's Truck Centers, significantly expanding its commercial electric vehicle (EV) reach in the mid-Atlantic region. This collaboration extends Bollinger's national dealer network to over 50 locations, covering Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania.</p><p>The partnership marks a crucial development in the commercial EV sector, as Bergey's Truck Centers has already placed its initial order for Bollinger's all-electric B4 trucks. These vehicles, designed with input from fleet operators to prioritize safety and capability, began deliveries in October. This move underscores the growing demand for sustainable transportation solutions in the commercial sector.</p><p>Bollinger Motors' expansion comes at a pivotal time for the EV industry, particularly in the commercial vehicle segment. The collaboration with Bergey's Truck Centers reflects a shared commitment to advancing electrified commercial vehicles, a sector that is increasingly important in reducing carbon emissions and meeting stringent environmental regulations.</p><p>The partnership is further bolstered by Bollinger's recent production launch and regulatory milestones. These achievements position the company to meet the rising demand for electric commercial vehicles effectively. The expansion of Bollinger's dealer network through this partnership is expected to enhance accessibility to electric commercial vehicles for businesses across the mid-Atlantic region.</p><p>This development is particularly significant for Mullen Automotive, which has been making strides in the EV industry. The company recently began commercial vehicle production at its Tunica, Mississippi plant in August 2023. Additionally, Mullen received IRS approval for federal EV tax credits on its commercial vehicles, offering eligible customers up to $7,500 per vehicle. This designation as a Qualified Manufacturer enhances the attractiveness of Mullen's vehicles in the market.</p><p>Further solidifying its position in the EV market, Mullen has achieved California Air Resource Board (CARB) and EPA certification for its Mullen ONE, a Class 1 EV cargo van, and Mullen THREE, a Class 3 EV cab chassis truck. The CARB-issued HVIP approval for the Mullen THREE provides an additional incentive, offering up to a $45,000 cash voucher at the time of vehicle purchase.</p><p>Mullen's commercial dealer network has also seen significant expansion, now including seven dealers across key markets in the Midwest, West Coast, Pacific Northwest, New England, and Mid-Atlantic regions. This expanded network, coupled with the company's manufacturing capabilities, positions Mullen to capitalize on the growing demand for commercial EVs.</p><p>The company's recent approval for Foreign Trade Zone (FTZ) status for its Tunica, Mississippi manufacturing center adds another layer of competitive advantage. This status provides benefits such as deferment of duties owed and elimination of duties on exported vehicles, potentially enhancing Mullen's operational efficiency and cost-effectiveness.</p><p>As the commercial EV sector continues to evolve, partnerships like the one between Bollinger Motors and Bergey's Truck Centers are likely to play a crucial role in accelerating the adoption of electric vehicles in commercial fleets. This collaboration not only expands the reach of sustainable transportation solutions but also contributes to the broader goal of reducing carbon emissions in the transportation sector.</p>
