<p>China's recent decision to halt exports of antimony to the United States has raised alarms within the defense and technology sectors, spotlighting the mineral's strategic significance. Antimony, essential for manufacturing ammunition, infrared missile systems, and advanced batteries, has experienced a price surge exceeding 200% this year due to these export restrictions. This move by Beijing is seen as a strategic leverage in the ongoing US-China trade tensions, given China's control over approximately 50% of global antimony mining and 80% of its production.</p><p>The ban poses significant challenges for major defense contractors, including Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT), whose flagship programs like the F-35 fighter jet and missile defense systems depend on a steady supply of antimony. This scenario underscores the critical need for the U.S. to diversify its supply chains and reduce reliance on potentially hostile nations for essential materials.</p><p>In response, companies such as Military Metals Corp. (OTCQB: MILIF) (CSE: MILI) are actively seeking alternative antimony sources, with recent acquisitions in Slovakia positioning them as potential key suppliers. Similarly, Perpetua Resources Corp. (Nasdaq: PPTA) is making strides with the Stibnite Gold Project in Idaho, which could become a vital domestic antimony source for U.S. defense needs, backed by Defense Production Act funding.</p><p>United States Antimony Corporation (NYSE: UAMY), the sole North American antimony smelter, is expanding its operations in Alaska to bolster domestic mineral supplies. These developments highlight the growing importance of securing stable, domestic sources of critical minerals to safeguard national security and technological advancement.</p><p>The antimony export ban has laid bare the vulnerabilities in the U.S. critical minerals supply chain, urging a strategic reassessment across industries. As geopolitical dynamics increasingly influence resource availability, the emphasis on developing secure and diversified mineral supplies becomes paramount for maintaining technological leadership and ensuring national security in an uncertain global landscape.</p>
