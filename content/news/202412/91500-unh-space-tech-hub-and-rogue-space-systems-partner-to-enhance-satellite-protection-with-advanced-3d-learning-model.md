<p>The University of New Hampshire (UNH) Space Tech Hub has announced a strategic partnership with Rogue Space Systems Corporation to develop an advanced 3D learning model focused on high-energy electrons in space. This initiative, supported by a $180,000 Phase I Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) award from SpaceWERX, aims to enhance the protection and operational planning for satellites and spacecraft in Earth's orbit by predicting changes in the outer radiation belt during geomagnetic storms.</p><p>High-energy electrons pose a significant risk to space assets, capable of causing interference or permanent damage. The predictive model being developed will provide early warnings, enabling operators to implement preventive measures to safeguard their satellites and spacecraft. RÃ©ka Winslow, Director of UNH Space Tech Hub, highlighted the project's potential to translate scientific expertise into practical tools for satellite operation improvement.</p><p>Jon Beam, co-founder and CEO of Rogue Space Systems, pointed out the broader benefits of the project, including minimizing damage, reducing catastrophic failures, and extending mission lifespans. Additionally, the model could lead to lower insurance costs and provide critical early warnings for geomagnetic storms affecting both commercial and defense satellites.</p><p>This partnership underscores the importance of collaboration between academia and industry, supported by government funding, to tackle the challenges of space exploration and satellite technology. The UNH Space Tech Hub's expertise in radiation modeling, combined with Rogue Space Systems' innovative approach, positions this project as a pivotal step towards enhancing the resilience of space assets and reinforcing U.S. leadership in space research and security.</p><p>As the reliance on space-based systems for global communications, navigation, and defense continues to grow, the development of predictive models like this one is crucial for ensuring the reliability and longevity of satellites and spacecraft. The success of this project could herald a new era of more robust and resilient satellite networks, capable of withstanding the extreme conditions of space.</p>
