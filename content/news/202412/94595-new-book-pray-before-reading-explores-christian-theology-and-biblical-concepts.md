<p>Ryan Ivesdal's debut book, 'Pray Before Reading,' has been released, offering an in-depth exploration of biblical concepts and Christian theology. The book addresses fundamental questions of Christian faith, such as freewill, the doctrine of election, God's sovereignty, and predestination, through consistent scriptural exposition. Ivesdal, a North Dakota native and devoted Christian, aims to provide clarity on these complex topics, drawing from his 13 years of active membership in his local church and his passion for evangelism.</p><p>'Pray Before Reading' is described as a 'biblical expedition,' exploring the coexistence and operation of the spiritual and physical realms. It sheds light on 'dark subjects' like deception, religion, and Christianity from a biblical perspective, and includes elements of biblical and church history, as well as the origins of religion. A unique feature of the book is its exploration of the Book of Revelation, offering both human and spiritual perspectives on future events to provide a comprehensive understanding of biblical prophecy and eschatology.</p><p>The book, published by Clay Bridges Press, a Houston-area hybrid publisher, has already garnered positive reviews and is seen as a significant contribution to Christian literature. It offers both new and experienced believers a resource for deepening their understanding of biblical concepts, potentially influencing discussions on Christian doctrine and biblical interpretation. As 'Pray Before Reading' circulates, it may spark conversations about the nature of reality, the interpretation of scripture, and the role of faith in understanding complex theological concepts, contributing to the ongoing dialogue within Christian circles about the application of biblical principles in contemporary life.</p>
