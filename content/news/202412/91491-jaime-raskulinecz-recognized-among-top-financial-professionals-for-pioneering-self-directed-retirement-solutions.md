<p>Jaime Raskulinecz, CEO of Next Generation Trust Company, has been honored with a prestigious recognition in the financial industry, being named to Investment News' 2024 Hot List of Top Financial Professionals for the second consecutive year. This accolade underscores her significant influence in the wealth management sector, particularly through her work with self-directed retirement accounts.</p><p>Next Generation Trust Company, founded by Raskulinecz over twenty years ago, specializes in the administration and custody of self-directed IRAs, HSAs, and ESAs. The company distinguishes itself by educating clients on the benefits of self-direction and enabling portfolio diversification into alternative assets like real estate, precious metals, and private equity. This approach allows investors to tailor their retirement savings to their personal knowledge and investment preferences.</p><p>Raskulinecz's inclusion in the Hot List, which features 97 influential professionals nationwide, reflects her vision to fill a gap in the financial services market. She identified a lack of options for including alternative assets in IRAs, traditionally limited to stocks, bonds, and mutual funds, and built a platform to meet this need. Her leadership has not only earned her multiple awards but has also positioned Next Generation as a leader in innovative retirement planning solutions.</p><p>The recognition of Raskulinecz and Next Generation highlights a shift in retirement planning towards alternative investments, especially as traditional vehicles face volatility. Beyond serving individual investors, the company educates financial professionals on self-directed plans, expanding the reach and understanding of these options. This trend towards diversification and personalization in retirement savings is gaining momentum, with Raskulinecz's repeated recognition signaling its growing significance in the financial industry.</p>
