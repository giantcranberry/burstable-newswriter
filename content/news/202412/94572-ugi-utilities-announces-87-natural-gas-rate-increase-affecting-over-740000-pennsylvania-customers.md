<p>UGI Utilities, Inc. has announced an 8.7% increase in natural gas rates effective December 1, 2024, impacting over 740,000 customers across 46 Pennsylvania counties. This adjustment will raise the average residential heating customer's monthly bill from $95.40 to $103.69, a direct reflection of the ongoing upward trend in wholesale natural gas prices.</p><p>Paul Szykman, Chief Regulatory Officer at UGI, clarified that the company is legally obligated to pass the cost of natural gas directly to customers without any markup. Despite the increase, Szykman reassured that natural gas remains a clean, safe, reliable, and affordable energy choice for homes and businesses. The rate hike, however, is expected to place additional financial pressure on households, especially those with fixed or limited incomes.</p><p>In response to the potential financial strain, UGI is offering various assistance programs and payment options to help customers manage their heating bills. These include budget billing, multiple payment options through their online account center and app, and an auto-pay program. Furthermore, UGI is facilitating access to federally funded Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) grants for eligible customers.</p><p>To combat the impact of rising costs, UGI is also advocating for energy efficiency measures. Customers can find resources on energy-saving programs at <a href='https://www.ugi.com/energy-saving-tips' rel='nofollow' target='_blank'>www.ugi.com/energy-saving-tips</a>, aimed at reducing energy consumption and monthly bills.</p><p>This rate increase arrives during a period of heightened economic pressures for many households, exacerbated by inflation and other rising costs. The timing, coinciding with the onset of the winter heating season, may present additional challenges. Nonetheless, UGI's proactive measures to offer assistance and promote energy efficiency highlight its commitment to supporting customers through these adjustments.</p><p>The natural gas industry remains a pivotal component of Pennsylvania's energy sector, with this rate adjustment mirroring wider market trends influencing energy prices across the nation. Given the volatility of global energy markets, consumers are advised to prepare for possible future adjustments and explore long-term strategies for managing energy consumption and expenses.</p><p>For more information on assistance programs, customers are encouraged to visit <a href='https://www.ugi.com/customerassistance' rel='nofollow' target='_blank'>www.ugi.com/customerassistance</a> or contact UGI's dedicated helpline.
