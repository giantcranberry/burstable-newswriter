<p>New Era Helium, Inc. (NEH) has achieved a significant milestone by completing its business combination with Roth CH V Holdings, Inc. and Roth CH Acquisition V. Co., a move that transitions the company into a publicly traded entity on Nasdaq under the ticker symbols 'NEHC' and 'NEHCW'. This development is a strategic step for NEH as it aims to become a leading consolidator in the helium and natural gas production sectors, leveraging its substantial reserves and strategic location in Southeast New Mexico.</p><p>The company's Nasdaq listing is not just a financial milestone but also a strategic positioning to attract institutional investors, especially those interested in the AI datacenter and helium markets. With over 137,000 acres and 1.5 billion cubic feet of proved and probable helium reserves, NEH is well-equipped to meet the increasing demand for helium, a critical resource in high-tech applications such as MRI machines, semiconductor manufacturing, and AI-powered data centers.</p><p>In a significant boost to its growth initiatives, NEH has secured $75 million through an equity purchase agreement with ATW Partners Opportunities Management, LLC, alongside $10 million in senior secured notes and warrants for up to an additional $30 million in common stock. This financial backing underscores the confidence in NEH's business model and its potential to address the current supply constraints and price volatility in the helium market.</p><p>Further solidifying its position in the sustainable technology sector, NEH has announced a non-binding joint venture with Sharon AI, Inc. to develop a 90MW net-zero Tier 3 data center in the Permian Basin. This project highlights NEH's commitment to sustainable innovation, combining Sharon AI's high-performance computing expertise with NEH's helium and natural gas reserves. The facility is expected to offset approximately 250,000 metric tons of CO2 annually, marking a significant step towards reducing the carbon footprint of data centers.</p><p>The completion of this business combination and the subsequent Nasdaq listing come at a critical time for the helium market, which is facing growing demand and supply challenges. NEH's entry into the public markets as a vertically integrated helium producer could play a pivotal role in stabilizing the market while offering investors a unique opportunity to engage with a resource that is becoming increasingly vital to the technology and healthcare industries.</p><p>As NEH embarks on its journey as a publicly traded company, its strategic reserves, financial backing, and commitment to sustainability position it as a key player in the helium supply chain and the broader push towards sustainable energy practices in the technology sector. The implications of NEH's growth and innovation extend beyond the company, potentially influencing the development of AI infrastructure and the global helium market.</p>
