<p>Bitdeer Technologies Group (NASDAQ: BTDR) has released its November operational update, highlighting a strong performance in Bitcoin mining and ambitious future plans. The company mined 150 Bitcoins for its own account, showcasing the effectiveness of its operations in a bullish cryptocurrency market. A significant part of the update focuses on the progress of its proprietary SEALMINER technology, with the SEALMINER A2 mining machines on track for mass production by Q3 2025. Already, 20% of the initial units for external sale have been reserved, indicating strong market demand.</p><p>The company is also advancing in chip development, working on the next-generation SEAL04 chip, which aims for an energy efficiency of 5 J/TH, potentially setting a new industry standard. Beyond mining technology, Bitdeer has expanded its customer-hosted mining rigs by 11,000 units in November, strengthening its position in the hosting services market. The recent $400 million convertible notes offering is being utilized to fund strategic data center expansions and accelerate the development of ASIC-based mining rigs.</p><p>Linghui Kong, Bitdeer's Chief Business Officer, has earmarked 2025 as a transformative year for the company, with plans to bring 1.1GW of new power capacity online. This expansion is expected to significantly enhance Bitdeer's mining capabilities and market presence. In the high-performance computing sector, Bitdeer is making strides in AI and Machine Learning technologies, expanding its AI cloud services to the U.S. and the Netherlands, and receiving an early delivery of Nvidia's H200 chips to its Tier-3 data center.</p><p>Infrastructure development remains a priority, with several data center projects advancing globally. Notable projects include a 40 MW phase 1 expansion in Tydal, Norway, by the end of 2024, a 100 MW hydro-cooling conversion in Rockdale, Texas, expected in early 2025, and a 500 MW construction project in Jigmeling, Bhutan, slated for Q2 2025. These developments, along with the operational update, have positively impacted Bitdeer's stock price, which has more than tripled between November 1 and mid-December. As Bitdeer prepares to present at the Annual Needham Growth Conference in January, its focus on technological innovation and infrastructure expansion positions it as a potential leader in the evolving cryptocurrency and high-performance computing industries.</p>
