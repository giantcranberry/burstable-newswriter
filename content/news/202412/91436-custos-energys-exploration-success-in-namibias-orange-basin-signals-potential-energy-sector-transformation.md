<p>Custos Energy, a Namibian independent oil and gas exploration company, has reported significant advancements in its second exploration and appraisal campaign within Namibia's Orange Basin, under Petroleum Exploration License 83 (PEL 83). The campaign's success, particularly at the Mopane-2A well, has uncovered hydrocarbon columns of gas-condensate and light oil in the AVO-3 and AVO-4 reservoirs, respectively. These findings are notable for their high-quality sands, favorable porosities and permeabilities, and minimal CO2 concentrations, suggesting lower production and processing costs.</p><p>The joint venture, led by Galp Energia of Portugal, is now moving forward with drilling the Mopane-3X exploration well, targeting additional prospects. This aggressive exploration strategy is complemented by a high-resolution 3D seismic campaign aimed at evaluating the commercial viability of the discoveries. Knowledge Katti, Custos's Chairman and CEO, highlighted the campaign's success as evidence of the Mopane complex's potential, emphasizing its strategic importance for Namibia's energy sector.</p><p>These developments could have far-reaching implications for Namibia, potentially transforming the country into a significant energy producer. The Orange Basin's emergence as a prospective oil and gas region has attracted international interest, with the potential to boost Namibia's economy through energy independence, job creation, and economic growth. Custos's involvement, alongside NAMCOR and Galp, underscores the collaborative effort to harness these resources for national development.</p><p>The ongoing exploration in PEL 83 is closely watched by industry stakeholders, as its outcomes could redefine Namibia's role in the global energy landscape. The discoveries at Mopane-2A and the anticipation for Mopane-3X highlight the region's untapped potential, marking a pivotal moment for Namibia's energy future.</p>
