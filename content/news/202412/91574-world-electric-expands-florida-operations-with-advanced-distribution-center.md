<p>World Electric, a subsidiary of Sonepar, has marked a significant expansion in Florida with the inauguration of a 266,000-square-foot regional distribution center (RDC) in Hialeah Gardens. This facility is set to revolutionize the company's service delivery to residential, commercial, and industrial clients across south Florida by offering faster delivery times and specialized services.</p><p>The Hialeah Gardens RDC is equipped with cutting-edge features such as climate control, automated lighting systems, and the anticipated introduction of picking robots by early 2025. These innovations aim to optimize operational efficiency and order fulfillment. Beyond standard distribution, the center provides a comprehensive range of services including color wire and parallel wire pulls, prefabrication, kitting, and Pro Logistic Services, a logistics management solution.</p><p>Tammy Livers, President of World Electric, underscored the RDC's strategic role in addressing the evolving needs of customers. "Our customers require a distributor that can adeptly handle complex projects, offer services like kitting and prefabrication, and ensure product availability with just-in-time delivery," Livers remarked. She attributed the company's ability to meet these demands to its regional distribution strategy and commitment to continuous improvement.</p><p>This expansion is a key component of World Electric's growth strategy, which has included the opening of branches in Gainesville and Winter Haven over the past two years and strategic acquisitions such as Electric Supply of Tampa (ESI) in 2023 and Advance Electric in 2022. Managed by Rodrigo Aguilar, the new RDC's location and advanced capabilities are poised to significantly boost World Electric's regional service offerings.</p><p>As part of Sonepar, a global leader with $36 billion in sales in 2023, World Electric has access to international resources and expertise, enabling it to maintain a strong local presence while benefiting from global insights. The Hialeah Gardens RDC exemplifies the increasing significance of efficient, technology-driven distribution networks in the electrical supply industry, catering to the sophisticated needs of today's customers and supporting the broader trend of industry electrification.</p><p>For south Florida's electrical contractors, industrial clients, and commercial businesses, the new RDC offers enhanced access to a diverse product range and services, promising to reduce lead times and improve project management. This advancement is expected to positively impact the local construction and industrial sectors, potentially speeding up project completion and elevating efficiency in electrical installations and maintenance.</p>
