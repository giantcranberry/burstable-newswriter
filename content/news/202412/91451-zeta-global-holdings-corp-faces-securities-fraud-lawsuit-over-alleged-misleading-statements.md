<p>A securities fraud class action lawsuit has been filed against Zeta Global Holdings Corp. (NYSE: ZETA), accusing the company of making materially false and misleading statements regarding its business operations and prospects. The lawsuit, representing investors who purchased or acquired Zeta securities between February 27, 2024, and November 13, 2024, aims to recover damages for those impacted by the alleged misconduct.</p><p>Filed by Kessler Topaz Meltzer & Check, LLP, the complaint alleges Zeta used two-way contracts and round trip transactions to artificially inflate financial results, alongside employing predatory consent farms for data collection, which reportedly drove the company's growth. These practices, if proven, could have misled investors relying on the company's disclosures during the class period.</p><p>The lawsuit underscores the critical need for transparency and accurate disclosure in public companies, especially in the tech and data-driven marketing sector. With the lead plaintiff deadline set for January 21, 2025, affected investors are urged to evaluate their legal options, including the possibility of leading the litigation.</p><p>This legal action not only poses significant financial implications for Zeta and its investors but also raises broader concerns about corporate governance, data collection ethics, and financial reporting integrity in the industry. The outcome could influence future regulatory approaches and corporate practices in rapidly evolving tech-based businesses.</p><p>As the case progresses, it will be essential for investors to monitor developments, which may offer insights into the challenges of ensuring ethical standards and transparency in data-driven industries. The lawsuit serves as a stark reminder of the importance of securities laws in safeguarding investor interests and the potential consequences of corporate misconduct.</p>
