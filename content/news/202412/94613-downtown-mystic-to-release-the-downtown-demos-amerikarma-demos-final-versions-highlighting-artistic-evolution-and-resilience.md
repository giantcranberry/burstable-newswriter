The upcoming release is further promoted by an AI-generated video for 'Shadow Walk,' created by Joshua Elyashiv of SHIV, marking a innovative step in the artist's engagement with technology.</p><p>Looking forward to 2025, DownTown Mystic plans to release a new single, 'One More Chance,' accompanied by another AI video, and 'The Wish' album in the spring. The artist's music will also feature in upcoming films, expanding their reach and influence in the music and entertainment industries.</p><p>'The DownTown Demos: AmeriKarma Demos & Final Versions' not only enriches DownTown Mystic's discography but also serves as a testament to Allen's resilience and creativity.
