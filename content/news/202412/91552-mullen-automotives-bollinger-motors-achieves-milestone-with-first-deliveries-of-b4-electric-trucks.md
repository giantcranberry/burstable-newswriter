<p>Mullen Automotive's subsidiary, Bollinger Motors, has marked a significant milestone in the commercial electric vehicle (EV) sector with the successful delivery of its first 25 all-electric B4 chassis cab trucks. This achievement, resulting in $4.1 million in retail sales since production began in September, underscores the growing market reception for Bollinger's innovative electric commercial vehicles and solidifies Mullen Automotive's position in the EV industry.</p><p>The Class 4 B4 truck, developed with insights from fleet operators, features a 158-kWh battery, over 7,300 pounds of payload capacity, and a 185-mile range. These specifications make the B4 truck a viable alternative to traditional fossil fuel-powered vehicles, addressing the increasing demand for sustainable transportation solutions in logistics and delivery sectors.</p><p>Bollinger Motors credits the rapid adoption of its B4 truck to an expanding dealer network and strong customer interest. Key to this success are the EPA and CARB certifications obtained, enabling vehicle sales across the United States, and a manufacturing partnership with Roush Industries, ensuring production quality.</p><p>Strategic collaborations with top commercial dealers and service providers are central to Bollinger's approach, aiming to build a comprehensive sales and support network for its EVs. This infrastructure is vital for customer satisfaction and the broader adoption of EV technology in commercial applications.</p><p>Looking forward, Bollinger Motors plans to expand its dealer network into 2025, aligning with Mullen Automotive's broader EV market ambitions. Mullen's recent milestones include initiating commercial vehicle production in Tunica, Mississippi, securing IRS approval for federal EV tax credits, and growing its commercial dealer network to seven dealers in key U.S. markets.</p><p>The delivery of Bollinger's B4 trucks highlights Mullen Automotive's strategic growth, supported by two U.S.-based production facilities in Tunica and Mishawaka, Indiana. These facilities, totaling 770,000 square feet, are poised to meet rising demand for electric commercial vehicles. Additionally, FTZ status at the Tunica plant offers competitive advantages, such as duty deferment and elimination on exports, enhancing Mullen's market competitiveness.</p><p>The successful launch of the B4 trucks reflects the increasing acceptance of EVs in the commercial sector, driven by businesses' sustainability goals. Mullen Automotive, through Bollinger Motors, is at the forefront of this shift, potentially transforming the commercial vehicle industry and accelerating the adoption of sustainable transportation solutions.</p>
