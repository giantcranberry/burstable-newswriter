<p>The partnership between V-GREEN and Prime Group to establish 100,000 electric vehicle (EV) charging stations across Indonesia represents a transformative initiative for the country's EV market. With an estimated investment of $1.2 billion over the next three years, this project aims to significantly reduce one of the major barriers to EV adoption in Indonesia: the lack of charging infrastructure.</p><p>Indonesia's EV market has experienced rapid growth, with sales increasing from minimal figures in 2020 to over 10,000 units in 2022. Despite this progress, EVs still only account for 0.5% of total vehicle sales, highlighting the need for enhanced infrastructure to support further growth. The current availability of approximately 1,500 public charging stations, mostly located in urban areas, is insufficient to meet the demands of a growing EV user base.</p><p>V-GREEN, associated with VinFast, will spearhead the development of the charging network in key Indonesian cities such as Jakarta, Surabaya, and Bali. This strategic focus aligns with the regions' high potential for EV adoption and V-GREEN's expansion goals in Indonesia. Prime Group will contribute its financial resources and global partnerships to fund the project, marking its foray into Southeast Asia's green transportation sector.</p><p>Construction is set to commence in January 2025, with the first stations expected to become operational later that year. V-GREEN will also conduct market research to optimize the placement of charging stations, ensuring they meet the evolving needs of EV users. This initiative not only supports Indonesia's environmental goals but also positions the country as a leader in sustainable transportation within the region.</p><p>The collaboration between V-GREEN and Prime Group is a testament to the growing importance of green transportation solutions. By addressing the critical infrastructure gap, this project could significantly boost EV adoption in Indonesia, aligning with global sustainability trends and the Indonesian government's supportive policies towards electric vehicles. The success of this initiative may inspire similar efforts in other developing countries, further accelerating the global shift towards clean transportation technologies.</p>
