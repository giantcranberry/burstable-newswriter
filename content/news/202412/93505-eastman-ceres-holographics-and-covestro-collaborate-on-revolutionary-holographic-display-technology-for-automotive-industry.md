<p>The automotive industry is on the brink of a technological revolution with the announcement of a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between Eastman, Ceres Holographics, and Covestro. This collaboration seeks to explore the commercial production of Holographic In-Plane Transparent Display (HIPTD) technology, targeting automotive and transportation glazing applications. The initiative is a response to the increasing demand from global Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) for advanced convenience, safety, and user experience features in vehicles.</p><p>At the heart of this partnership is the development of next-generation Head-Up Displays (HUDs), designed to surpass the limitations of traditional systems in terms of performance, size, and geometry. This innovation enables the integration of multiple displays within a single windshield and other glazing areas, a significant leap forward in automotive display technology. The collaboration builds on years of joint research and development, combining the strengths of each company to create holographic-enabled transparent HUDs for the automotive market.</p><p>The technology was showcased in 2024 to OEMs across Europe, the USA, and China, featuring displays with multiple transparent screens in a single laminated windshield. These screens, measuring up to 400mm by 300mm, represent the industry's largest field of view, achieved through the use of custom-designed holographic optical elements (HOEs) embedded in Covestro's Bayfol HX® film and laminated with Eastman's innovative interlayer stack.</p><p>This breakthrough is the result of combining Covestro's photopolymer films expertise, Ceres' digital mastering and HoloFlekt® roll-to-roll replication system, and Eastman's solutions for encapsulating functional films into automotive-approved laminates. The potential of this technology has already been recognized by major automotive manufacturers, including Ford Motor Co., which has validated the production process and performance of the triple-screen holographic HUD system through a two-year program.</p><p>The agreement marks a pivotal moment in the journey towards commercializing holographic transparent displays on a global scale. According to Hemant Dandekar of Eastman, this collaboration is a step closer to delivering a full-stack solution for innovative display implementations. Similarly, Günther Walze of Covestro and Andy Travers of Ceres Holographics have highlighted the readiness of their technologies to meet automotive safety requirements and the growing industry demand for safer, more intuitive information display features.</p><p>As the automotive industry continues to evolve, the partnership between Eastman, Ceres Holographics, and Covestro is set to redefine in-vehicle information displays, offering enhanced experiences for drivers and passengers alike while contributing to road safety. The technology will be demonstrated at CES 2025 in Las Vegas, providing a glimpse into the future of automotive displays.</p>
