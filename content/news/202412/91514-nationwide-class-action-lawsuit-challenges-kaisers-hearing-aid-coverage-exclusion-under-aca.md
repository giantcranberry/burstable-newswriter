<p>Jason Delessert, a Burien, Washington resident, has filed a nationwide class action lawsuit against Kaiser Foundation Health Plan, accusing the healthcare provider of illegal disability discrimination under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) for excluding hearing aid coverage. This case represents the first nationwide class action to challenge such exclusions under the ACA on behalf of hearing-disabled individuals requiring prescription hearing aids.</p><p>The lawsuit follows a previous case, Schmitt v. Kaiser Foundation Health Plan of Washington, which was confined to Washington state insureds and settled without involving Delessert. Delessert, who depends on prescription hearing aids for daily activities, argues that Kaiser's policy discriminates against individuals with hearing disabilities by not covering hearing aids as 'durable medical equipment,' despite covering similar devices for other health conditions.</p><p>Attorneys representing Delessert, including Eleanor Hamburger of Sirianni Youtz Spoonemore Hamburger PLLC and Anna Prakash of Nichols Kaster, assert that Kaiser's hearing aid exclusion is a form of illegal discrimination that the ACA was designed to eliminate. The lawsuit references the ACA's mandate for healthcare providers to avoid discriminatory practices, a principle underscored in the Schmitt case ruling.</p><p>This legal challenge could have significant implications for the healthcare industry and individuals with hearing disabilities across the United States. A favorable outcome may lead to expanded hearing aid coverage by health insurance plans, enhancing access for millions with hearing loss. Moreover, the case could establish a precedent for future disputes over healthcare coverage for disabled individuals, emphasizing the need for compliance with the ACA's non-discrimination provisions.</p><p>The lawsuit not only highlights the persistent barriers to equitable healthcare access for disabled individuals but also the potential for legal action to enforce the ACA's protections.
