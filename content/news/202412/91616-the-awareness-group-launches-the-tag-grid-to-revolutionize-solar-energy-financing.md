<p>The Awareness Group (OTC: FHLD), now a fully SEC-reporting public company, has unveiled The TAG GRID, an innovative platform designed to revolutionize the solar energy financing and project development landscape. This ecosystem integrates various solar industry service providers, including sales and lead generation organizations, brokers, and installation contractors, to streamline the entire process from project conception to completion.</p><p>Central to The TAG GRID is TAG Financial, which includes two pivotal divisions: TAG Financial Services (TFS) and TAG Capital. TFS oversees the project process for sales organizations and contractors, whereas TAG Capital specializes in fund management, servicing or securitizing lending portfolios, and monetizing investment tax credits. This dual approach ensures a seamless flow from financing to project execution.</p><p>A standout feature of TAG's offerings is its Residential National Solar Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) program. This program diverges from traditional PPAs by eliminating the reliance on credit scores, thereby removing minimum FICO score and income requirements. This innovative financing solution could significantly lower barriers to entry for homeowners, making solar energy more accessible to a wider audience and potentially disrupting the renewables market.</p><p>The U.S. solar energy market is on a rapid growth trajectory, with projections from the U.S. Energy Information Administration highlighting solar and wind as leaders in power generation growth. TAG's integrated business model distinguishes it from competitors focused on singular aspects of the solar industry, such as installation or system design, positioning TAG as a comprehensive solution provider.</p><p>TAG's strategic growth includes acquisitions to bolster The TAG GRID and introduce cutting-edge technologies. With five acquisitions in the alternative energy sector already under its belt, TAG is strengthening its market presence. Furthermore, the company plans to utilize blockchain technology to develop innovative incentive programs, enabling solar system owners and TAG GRID members to potentially trade energy among users.</p><p>With the domestic solar market surpassing $320 billion and expected to grow, TAG's holistic approach could significantly contribute to the acceleration of renewable energy adoption. By addressing traditional financing hurdles and creating an integrated ecosystem for solar projects, TAG is poised to emerge as a leader in the alternative energy sector.</p><p>The launch of The TAG GRID arrives at a pivotal moment, with the residential solar energy market anticipated to exceed 190 gigawatts by 2029, according to Mordor Intelligence. Factors such as supportive government policies, increased investments, and declining solar energy costs are driving this growth. TAG's efforts to make solar power more accessible could play a crucial role in the United States' transition to cleaner, more sustainable energy sources.</p>
