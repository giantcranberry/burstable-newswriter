<p>Mullen Automotive, a Southern California-based electric vehicle manufacturer, has announced the sale of 100 Class 1 and Class 3 electric cargo vans and trucks since September 30, 2024, generating $5.5 million in revenue. This achievement underscores the company's growing presence in the competitive EV market.</p><p>In a significant financial turnaround, Mullen has reduced its monthly burn rate from $16.8 million in August to $5.3 million in October and November. This improvement in operational efficiency could enhance the company's profitability and sustainability, making it a more attractive option for investors and stakeholders.</p><p>CEO David Michery highlighted the increasing demand for sustainable transportation solutions, with ongoing discussions with government agencies and large fleets. This interest from potential high-volume customers indicates a bright future for Mullen's commercial EV offerings.</p><p>Mullen's product lineup, including the Mullen ONE and Mullen THREE commercial EVs, meets strict U.S. emissions standards and qualifies for state and federal incentives, offering potential rebates of up to $45,000. These incentives could make Mullen's vehicles more appealing to businesses looking to transition to electric fleets.</p><p>The company has expanded its manufacturing capabilities with two U.S.-based plants in Tunica, Mississippi, and Mishawaka, Indiana, totaling 770,000 square feet. Commercial vehicle production began in Tunica in August 2023, marking a key milestone in Mullen's growth strategy.</p><p>Mullen received IRS approval for federal EV tax credits on its commercial vehicles in September 2023, offering eligible customers up to $7,500 per vehicle. This, along with CARB and EPA certification for the Mullen ONE and Mullen THREE, enhances the company's market opportunities in the U.S.</p><p>With a commercial dealer network now including seven dealers, such as Pap√© Kenworth and Pritchard EV, Mullen is expanding its sales and service coverage across crucial U.S. markets. The Tunica plant's Foreign Trade Zone status further bolsters Mullen's competitive edge by deferring duties and eliminating them on exported vehicles.</p><p>As the automotive industry shifts towards electrification, Mullen Automotive's advancements in sales, cost management, and market expansion highlight its potential as a significant player in the commercial EV sector.</p>
