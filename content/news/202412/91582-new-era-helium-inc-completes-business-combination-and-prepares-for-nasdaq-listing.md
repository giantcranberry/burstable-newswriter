<p>New Era Helium, Inc. (NEH) has successfully completed its business combination with Roth CH Acquisition V Co., a pivotal step that transitions NEH into a publicly traded entity on Nasdaq under the symbols 'NEHC' and 'NEHCW'. This development is a testament to NEH's robust portfolio, which includes over 137,000 acres in Southeast New Mexico and 1.5 billion cubic feet of proved and probable helium reserves, positioning the company as a key player in the helium and natural gas production industry.</p><p>The timing of this business combination is particularly strategic, given the increasing demand for helium, fueled by its critical applications in data centers that power artificial intelligence technologies. NEH's recent announcement of a non-binding joint venture with Sharon AI, Inc. to build a 90MW net-zero Tier 3 data center in the Permian Basin further highlights its commitment to leveraging its resources for sustainable innovation. This project, which aims to offset approximately 250,000 metric tons of CO2 annually through carbon capture technology, aligns with the growing emphasis on environmental responsibility in the energy sector.</p><p>E. Will Gray II, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of New Era Helium, emphasized the significance of the Nasdaq listing for enhancing the company's visibility among institutional investors, particularly those interested in the AI datacenter and helium markets. This increased exposure is expected to play a crucial role as NEH seeks to consolidate its position in a market that is witnessing rising demand for helium across various high-tech applications, including MRI machines, semiconductor manufacturing, and space exploration.</p><p>The completion of this business combination and the upcoming Nasdaq listing represent a critical milestone for NEH, offering the company a platform to pursue its growth strategy in the helium and natural gas sectors. With its focus on sustainable practices and cutting-edge technology, NEH is poised to set new industry standards, making its progress a point of interest for stakeholders across the energy, technology, and sustainability fields.</p>
