<p>Mullen Automotive, a Southern California-based electric vehicle manufacturer, has recently secured an order for 10 Class 3 EV cab chassis trucks from Associated Coffee, a distributor in the San Francisco Bay Area. This order, fulfilled through Mullen's authorized dealer Pap√© Group, highlights the growing adoption of electric vehicles in commercial operations, particularly in urban delivery sectors where environmental sustainability and cost efficiency are becoming increasingly important.</p><p>The Class 3 Mullen THREE trucks are designed for urban last-mile delivery, catering to the demand for eco-friendly transportation solutions in densely populated areas. These vehicles not only meet stringent emissions standards but also offer significant financial incentives, including up to $52,500 in rebates and tax credits for eligible customers. Additionally, the CARB-issued HVIP approval for the Mullen THREE provides up to a $45,000 cash voucher at the time of purchase, further enhancing the economic appeal of transitioning to electric fleets.</p><p>This development is timely for Mullen Automotive, which commenced commercial vehicle production at its Tunica, Mississippi plant in August 2023. The company's expansion includes the certification of both the Mullen ONE and Mullen THREE by the California Air Resource Board and EPA, making them available for sale across the United States. Mullen's strategic expansion of its commercial dealer network, now including seven dealers nationwide, ensures comprehensive sales and service support for customers adopting commercial EVs.</p><p>Moreover, Mullen's acquisition of Foreign Trade Zone status for its Mississippi manufacturing center offers additional competitive advantages, such as duty deferments and eliminations on exported vehicles. This could significantly reduce costs and bolster Mullen's position in both domestic and international markets.</p><p>The order from Associated Coffee not only underscores the viability of commercial EVs but also contributes to broader environmental goals by reducing carbon emissions and improving urban air quality. As the demand for sustainable transportation solutions grows, Mullen Automotive's advancements in the commercial EV market could accelerate the shift towards electric fleets across various industries, marking a significant step forward in the global transition to cleaner, more efficient transportation options.</p>
