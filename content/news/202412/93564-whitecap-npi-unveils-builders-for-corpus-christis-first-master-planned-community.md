<p>Whitecap NPI has announced Azali Homes and Newcastle Homes as the chosen builders for its Showcase of Homes, marking a pivotal advancement in the development of Corpus Christi's first master-planned community. This project, located on the north end of Padre Island, is set to commence construction in December 2024, with an anticipated completion by the fourth quarter of 2025. The initiative aims to redefine coastal living by harmonizing luxury home designs with the natural island environment.</p><p>The collaboration brings together Sara Azali of Azali Homes and John Pope of Newcastle Homes, both of whom bring decades of experience in coastal construction to the table. The homes will feature a variety of high-end amenities, including rooftop terraces, elevators, and boat docks, designed by Place Designers and Will & Fotsch Architects. The community will span 240 acres, offering over 600 residential options, from single-family homes to condos, many with canal access for water enthusiasts.</p><p>A significant aspect of the development is the inclusion of a 30-acre nature preserve, aimed at restoring the natural barrier island habitat. This feature underscores the project's commitment to environmental stewardship while enhancing the living experience for future residents. Terence Johnson of Ashlar Development highlighted the selection of builders as a critical step towards realizing the vision for Whitecap NPI, which includes improving local infrastructure and water quality, alongside generating substantial revenue for Corpus Christi.</p><p>The groundbreaking for the community occurred in May 2023, with homesites currently available for purchase. This project not only represents a milestone in Corpus Christi's real estate and urban planning sectors but also sets a precedent for future coastal developments in Texas. By blending modern luxury with environmental consciousness, Whitecap NPI is poised to attract new residents and investors, potentially boosting the local economy and tourism.</p><p>As the first of its kind in the area, Whitecap NPI's master-planned community could influence future residential projects along the Texas Gulf Coast, offering a model for sustainable and luxurious coastal living. The involvement of seasoned local builders ensures that the homes will cater to the unique preferences of coastal dwellers, making this development a landmark project for the region.</p>
