<p>Golden Matrix Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: GMGI) is witnessing remarkable growth from its sweepstakes business segments, with RKings Competitions and Classics for a Cause leading the charge. These subsidiaries not only contribute significantly to GMGI's financial performance but also blend entertainment with social impact, setting a new standard in the online gaming and entertainment industry.</p><p>RKings Competitions, a leading online competition platform in the United Kingdom and Northern Ireland, has become a cornerstone of GMGI's portfolio. Since its establishment in 2018, RKings has offered participants the chance to win luxury prizes at a fraction of their retail value, distributing thousands of prizes and building a trusted community. In Q3 2024, RKings accounted for 22% of GMGI's quarterly revenue, generating $8.88 million, with a year-to-date contribution of $18.54 million. Its low customer acquisition cost of approximately $2 underscores its efficiency and scalability.</p><p>In Australia, Classics for a Cause is redefining charity gaming through vintage car raffles in partnership with local charities. Acquired just two months into Q3 2024, it has already contributed 5% of GMGI's revenue, amounting to $2.18 million, showcasing its potential in Australia's charity gaming segment. Beyond financial contributions, Classics for a Cause enhances awareness and support for charitable causes, demonstrating the social value embedded in GMGI's business model.</p><p>GMGI's commitment to ethical practices and regulatory compliance ensures that both RKings and Classics for a Cause operate within stringent national and regional regulations. This dedication not only fosters trust among participants but also strengthens GMGI's reputation as a leader in the online gaming industry.</p><p>As GMGI moves into the final quarter of 2024, the continued success of RKings and Classics for a Cause is expected to fuel the company's growth. These segments exemplify GMGI's strategic approach to diversifying revenue streams while making a positive impact on society. The blend of entertainment, potential for life-changing prizes, and social contribution positions GMGI as a multifaceted player in the global gaming market, appealing to a broad audience of participants and investors alike.</p>
