<p>LogicMark Inc. (NASDAQ: LGMK) has unveiled a new range of personal emergency response systems (PERS) aimed at improving the safety and independence of America's 8.1 million veterans over the age of 65. This initiative comes in response to the heightened risk of falls among aging veterans, a leading cause of injury and death in this demographic. The company's technology, including the Freedom Alert Mini and Guardian Alert 911 Plus, offers advanced features such as fall detection, GPS location services, and direct communication with emergency services, providing a vital safety net for veterans, especially those living alone.</p><p>The Freedom Alert Mini, a compact 4G LTE device, employs accelerometer sensors to detect falls automatically, alerting a 24/7 monitoring center, designated contacts, or emergency services. This feature is crucial for the significant portion of veterans who live alone and may lack immediate assistance. Additionally, the Guardian Alert 911 Plus enables users to communicate directly with 911 operators with a single button press, ensuring rapid access to help both indoors and outdoors.</p><p>For veterans who primarily stay at home, where the majority of falls occur, LogicMark offers landline-based devices like the Freedom Alert and Guardian Alert 911. These devices facilitate quick connections to pre-programmed contacts or emergency services and are designed with long-lasting batteries for reliability. The global market for fall detection systems is expected to grow at a 7.6% compound annual growth rate through 2030, highlighting the increasing demand for solutions that support the safety and independence of aging adults. LogicMark's products are well-positioned to meet this demand, particularly within the veteran community where the need is most pressing.</p><p>LogicMark's PERS technology not only addresses the immediate risks associated with falls but also provides peace of mind to caregivers and loved ones. As the population of aging veterans grows, the importance of such technology in maintaining their safety and quality of life cannot be overstated. By integrating fall detection, GPS tracking, and emergency communication, LogicMark's devices represent a comprehensive approach to preventing and responding to falls among veterans, potentially saving lives and fostering independence.</p>
