<p>The technology and energy sectors are witnessing a pivotal shift as leading tech companies, including Amazon, Google, and Microsoft, are making significant investments in nuclear power to address the soaring energy demands of artificial intelligence (AI) operations. These investments, particularly in small modular reactors (SMRs), underscore the critical role of reliable and clean energy sources in sustaining the rapid growth of AI technologies and data centers.</p><p>Amazon Web Services (AWS) has embarked on a $500 million investment in nuclear power, partnering with Dominion Energy to explore SMR development near Virginia's North Anna nuclear power station and collaborating with Energy Northwest in Washington state for additional SMR projects. Google's agreement with Kairos Power aims to introduce 500 MW of carbon-free power to the U.S. grids by 2035, while Microsoft's $1.6 billion partnership with Constellation Energy Corp. seeks to revive the Three Mile Island nuclear plant in Pennsylvania.</p><p>These initiatives reflect the escalating energy requirements of data centers, such as those in Virginia's Data Center Alley, which processes approximately 70% of global internet traffic daily. Dominion Energy forecasts an 85% surge in regional power demand over the next 15 years, highlighting the urgency for sustainable energy solutions.</p><p>The tech industry's pivot to nuclear energy has already influenced the stock market, with companies like Oklo Inc, Cameco, NuScale Power, and BWX Technologies experiencing notable stock price increases. Nuclear power's reputation as a safe and renewable clean energy source, as cited by Science Direct, further enhances its appeal amid the global push to reduce reliance on fossil fuels.</p><p>For investors, the growing interest in nuclear power opens up avenues in the uranium market, with investment vehicles such as the Sprott Uranium Miners ETF (URNM) and Sprott Junior Uranium Miners ETF (URNJ) providing access to uranium-related companies. This trend not only illustrates the vast energy needs of AI but also hints at a broader transformation in energy production and consumption, with nuclear power poised to play a key role in future energy strategies.</p>
