The acquisition of NEN, with its extensive network of 30,000 crane and bulk vending machines across 8,000 locations, complements Kiddleton's strategy to dominate the U.S. market. Furthermore, the integration of NEN's digital loyalty program, which boasts over 1 million enrolled players, underscores the growing importance of digital engagement in the amusement vending sector.</p><p>This merger is indicative of a larger trend towards the globalization of entertainment, with GENDA Inc., Kiddleton's parent company, aiming to build a worldwide entertainment network. The combined forces of Kiddleton and NEN are set to redefine the standards for game machine offerings and prize quality in the U.S., catering to the rising consumer demand for unique, culturally rich entertainment experiences.
