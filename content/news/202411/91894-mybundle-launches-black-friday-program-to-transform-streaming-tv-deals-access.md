<p>MyBundle has introduced a Black Friday program designed to change how holiday shoppers access streaming TV deals, leveraging its network of over 270 broadband providers to serve more than 13.5 million internet customers. This program aims to provide streaming services with significant exposure for their Black Friday offers while enabling broadband providers to use these deals for subscriber growth and retention.</p><p>The initiative includes publishing all Black Friday streaming deals on <a href='https://mybundle.tv/pages/black-friday' rel='nofollow' target='_blank'>mybundle.tv/pages/black-friday</a>, with immediate syndication across the broadband partner network. Additionally, MyBundle is offering partners marketing resources like customer emails and co-branded sites to promote their own Black Friday streaming TV deals.</p><p>Jason Cohen, Co-Founder and CEO of MyBundle, highlighted the program's potential to benefit all parties involved. Consumers can access great deals on streaming services from trusted providers, often with extra subsidies. Streaming services gain access to a vast customer base, and broadband providers can boost their revenue through subscriber growth and retention.</p><p>This Black Friday program is part of MyBundle's effort to make the streaming TV landscape more navigable for consumers. The company provides tools such as the Find My Bundle recommendation engine and a mobile app to help users manage their watchlists and find content. For sports fans, MyBundle offers an NFL schedule feature that lists streaming options for every game, organized by team, and highlights deals from streaming services.</p><p>The MyBundle Black Friday initiative could significantly impact the streaming TV industry by facilitating easier access to deals for consumers and offering streaming services and broadband providers a platform to reach new audiences. This program may set a precedent for future collaborations between internet service providers and streaming platforms, leading to more integrated approaches to digital entertainment.</p>
