<p>The City of Madison, Wisconsin, has taken a significant step forward in its commitment to sustainable public transportation by expanding its partnership with Solar Electric Supply (SES). The addition of two more SES ADU Tiny Home Solar Systems to the city's Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) project increases the total number of solar installations to 38, up from the initial 36 systems provided in 2023. This expansion is a clear indicator of Madison's dedication to achieving net-zero energy use for its public transit infrastructure.</p><p>Each SES ADU Tiny Home GT-2.16-240GT system is equipped with six REC 360NP2 high-efficiency solar panels, designed to meet the energy demands of bus stop shelters, including lighting and other electrical needs. The systems feature advanced technology such as Enphase IQ8 microinverters for AC grid interconnection and remote monitoring, alongside Ironridge racking to comply with Madison's strict snow loading requirements.</p><p>Garrett Gettleman, CEO of Solar Electric Supply, highlighted the importance of this collaboration, emphasizing the role of SES in supporting Madison's innovative approach to integrating solar energy into public transportation. The project is part of Madison's broader BRT initiative, which aims to connect the East Towne and West Towne malls via a 15-mile route featuring over 30 stations, with an expected opening in late 2024.</p><p>The project has not only advanced Madison's public transportation infrastructure but also set a benchmark for other cities. With a $110.6 million grant from the Federal Transit Administration, the BRT project has been recognized as a national model for sustainable transit solutions. Mayor Satya Rhodes-Conway pointed out the social benefits of the project, particularly its impact on improving transportation access for low-income residents and people of color.</p><p>This initiative underscores the growing synergy between renewable energy and urban planning, showcasing how cities can lead in the transition to cleaner, more efficient urban environments. The success of Madison's BRT project could inspire other municipalities to explore solar-powered transit solutions, contributing to broader efforts to combat climate change and enhance public services.</p>
