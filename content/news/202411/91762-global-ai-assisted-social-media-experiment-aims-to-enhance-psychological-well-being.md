<p>In an innovative approach to enhancing psychological well-being, two non-governmental organizations, Optimize Emotions and AI Brainstorm Creator, have initiated one of the world's largest AI-assisted social media experiments. This project utilizes online videoconferencing to evoke intense emotional experiences such as awe, laughter, compassion, and gratitude among participants worldwide. The experiment's protocols are derived from a wide array of disciplines, including Gestalt Therapy, Mahayana Buddhism, and cutting-edge Generative AI, aiming to redefine the interaction between technology and human emotions.</p><p>CIO Amy Chang highlights the experiment's goal to establish a 'Recommended Daily Allowance' for peak emotional states, suggesting that social media and AI can significantly contribute to psychological well-being. Through Zoom sessions conducted three times a week, participants engage in activities designed to inspire and connect individuals across the globe. John Toomey, Director of Innovation, notes the enduring appeal of these sessions, emphasizing the mutual inspiration derived from shared emotional experiences.</p><p>The experiment's potential to revolutionize our engagement with technology and each other is underscored by Education Director Savithri Patel. She points out the ability of AI to customize and share transcendent peak states, facilitating global cooperation to tackle pressing challenges. Activities within the experiment range from exploring awe-inspiring online content to AI-assisted group mind mapping for the UN's Sustainability Goals, and gratitude exercises involving live streams from a maternity hospital in the Philippines.</p><p>Further expanding its scope, the experiment includes laughter yoga club meetings in 31 countries and a Hero's Journey project partnering with underground schools for girls in Afghanistan. These initiatives not only aim to enhance individual well-being but also to foster collaborative problem-solving on a global scale. The integration of AI in these efforts showcases technology's potential to enrich human connections and address societal challenges.</p><p>As the project progresses, it offers promising insights into the application of technology for mental health, social cohesion, and international cooperation. The success of this experiment could herald new methodologies for utilizing social media and AI to promote collective well-being and solve complex global issues.
