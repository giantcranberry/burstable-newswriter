<p>The Mission Driven Bank Fund has taken a significant step towards enhancing its impact on the mission-driven banking sector by appointing its inaugural Mission Advisory Committee. This committee, composed of seven industry leaders with deep expertise in Minority Depository Institutions (MDIs), Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs), and the broader banking industry, is set to evaluate the Fund's investments for alignment with its mission objectives.</p><p>Paul Welch, portfolio manager of the Fund, highlighted the committee's role in providing valuable insights into identifying and capturing impact within the mission-driven banking sector. The committee's independence is expected to bring a new level of objectivity and depth to assessing the Fund's performance in meeting its goals.</p><p>The committee members, including Michael Collins, Nicole Elam, and Kim Fraser among others, bring a wealth of diverse experiences and perspectives. Their collective expertise spans across strategic planning, corporate development, and leadership within the banking and fintech sectors, positioning them uniquely to guide the Fund's mission-first focus.</p><p>Eric Heisner, a portfolio relationship manager and investment committee member, underscored the committee's potential to offer diversified expertise and enthusiasm. This will enable the committee to provide constructive feedback on the Fund's progress towards its mission goals, particularly in its nationwide outreach to MDIs and CDFIs.</p><p>The establishment of the Mission Advisory Committee is a testament to the Fund's commitment to fostering a more inclusive banking system. By targeting investments and technical services towards CDFIs and MDIs serving African American, Native American, Asian, Hispanic, and Pacific Islander communities, the Fund aims to drive growth and financial resilience in these sectors. This initiative is a critical step towards addressing the racial wealth gap and promoting economic equity.</p><p>Collaborating with Elizabeth Park Capital Management and Calvert Impact, the Fund's general partner, along with Strategic Value Bank Partners and Performance Trust, the Mission Driven Bank Fund is poised to make a significant impact. The formation of the Mission Advisory Committee not only enhances the Fund's accountability but also sets a precedent for future initiatives aimed at improving financial inclusion and economic opportunities for underserved populations.</p><p>This development is a clear indication of the financial industry's evolving approach to equity and inclusion. The Mission Driven Bank Fund's efforts, supported by the newly formed committee, could inspire similar initiatives, potentially transforming the landscape of community-focused banking and economic development in underserved areas across the United States.</p>
