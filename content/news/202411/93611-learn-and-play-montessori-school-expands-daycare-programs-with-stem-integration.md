<p>Learn And Play® Montessori School, a prominent early childhood education provider in the San Francisco Bay Area, has announced an expansion of its daycare programs to include children as young as 18 months old. This initiative underscores the school's dedication to offering high-quality early education across its campuses in Fremont, Dublin, Milpitas, Sunnyvale, and Hercules. The enhanced programs aim to nurture a love for learning from an early age, blending Montessori methodologies with STEM-based learning to introduce young minds to foundational concepts in math, science, and language through interactive play.</p><p>Kiran Grewal, Co-Founder of Learn And Play® Montessori, emphasizes the program's goal to build confidence, curiosity, and independence in children, setting a solid foundation for lifelong success. The curriculum is meticulously designed to promote brain development through guided play and practical life activities, focusing on holistic development that includes cognitive, social, and emotional growth. Art, music, and cultural studies are also integrated into the program, ensuring a comprehensive educational experience.</p><p>For Bay Area families, the expanded daycare program offers practical solutions, including extended hours and conveniently located campuses near major commuter routes. This expansion is timely, addressing the increasing demand for quality early childhood education in the region. Research highlights the critical role of early learning experiences in shaping future academic and personal achievements, making programs like these invaluable.</p><p>The incorporation of STEM into early childhood education is particularly noteworthy, aligning with the needs of a technology-centric future. By introducing these subjects in an age-appropriate manner, Learn And Play® Montessori is equipping children with essential skills for their future academic and professional endeavors. The program's accessibility, through extended hours and multiple locations, also reflects an understanding of the diverse needs of modern families, making quality early education more attainable.</p><p>This initiative not only benefits immediate participants but also has the potential to influence early childhood education practices more broadly. The successful integration of Montessori and STEM approaches could serve as a benchmark for other institutions aiming to enrich their early learning programs. As enrollment spaces are limited, families are encouraged to explore these opportunities promptly to secure a spot in this innovative educational setting.</p>
