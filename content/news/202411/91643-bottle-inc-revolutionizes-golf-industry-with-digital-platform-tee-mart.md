<p>Bottle Inc., a South Korean startup, is pioneering the digital transformation of the golf industry with its innovative platform, Tee Mart. This service automates various aspects of golfing, from reservations to payments, addressing inefficiencies in the traditional golf course operations. CEO Seungsoo Han highlights the significance of this shift, noting the growing popularity of golf post-COVID-19 and the need for digital solutions to cater to this expansion.</p><p>The platform employs a time-deal commerce model, similar to prepayment systems in other industries, to offer lower prices to consumers while helping golf courses optimize their revenue. This model is particularly appealing to Millennials and Gen Z, demographics that Bottle aims to attract by making golf more affordable. Since its launch in August 2023, Tee Mart has been adopted by approximately 30 golf courses in South Korea, achieving a notable repurchase rate of 25%.</p><p>At the heart of Tee Mart's success is its use of AI technology to dynamically adjust pricing in real-time, benefiting both golf courses and players. This technological edge not only enhances operational efficiency but also positions Bottle for potential expansion into other markets where digital golf services are lacking. The company's location in Pangyo, a center for IT innovation, has been crucial in developing these cutting-edge solutions.</p><p>Bottle's approach represents a significant shift in the golf industry, moving away from outdated post-payment systems to a more efficient prepayment model. This change mirrors transformations seen in the lodging and airline industries, suggesting a broader trend towards digitalization in recreational activities. By making golf more accessible and affordable, Bottle is not just changing how the sport is consumed; it's also expanding its appeal to a wider audience, potentially increasing participation and redefining golf's image as an inclusive activity.</p><p>The implications of Bottle's innovation extend beyond immediate operational improvements. As the company grows and possibly enters new markets, it could set new benchmarks for the golf industry worldwide, encouraging further digital adoption and making the sport more accessible to people of all ages and backgrounds. The success of Tee Mart underscores the potential for technology to revolutionize traditional industries, offering a glimpse into the future of recreational sports.</p>
