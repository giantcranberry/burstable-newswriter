<p>The PTAU-2 Wireless Microphone System, Phenyx Pro's latest innovation, is engineered to cater to the rigorous demands of audio professionals in mid-to-large venues. This system is a game-changer for live shows, corporate presentations, and theatrical productions, offering a blend of user-friendly design and advanced technological features.</p><p>Central to the PTAU-2's appeal is its streamlined control system, featuring a shuttle jog dial that simplifies access to essential settings like volume, RF SET, ID Lock, and Auto Scan. This design is particularly beneficial in fast-paced environments where quick adjustments are crucial. The ID Lock function stands out by ensuring reliable audio transmission by locking the selected frequency to a matched handheld microphone, thus preventing interference from other devices on the same frequency.</p><p>Frequency management, a common hurdle in wireless audio, is adeptly handled by the Auto Scan feature. This function automatically identifies and avoids congested channels, supporting up to 2x1000 selectable frequencies. Additionally, the built-in spectrum analyzer aids in visualizing signal conditions, enabling users to select optimal frequency bands and manage their setups more effectively alongside other wireless systems.</p><p>The system's versatility is further demonstrated through adjustable transmitter power and receiver sensitivity settings. With options for 5mW, 10mW, and 30mW transmitter power, the PTAU-2 can be tailored to various venue sizes and environmental conditions. Similarly, the receiver sensitivity can be adjusted to High, Mid, or Low settings, ensuring optimal performance based on specific requirements and microphone placement.</p><p>Signal reliability is bolstered by the True Diversity Circuit, which employs two independent receiver modules and antennas per channel. This technology continuously monitors and selects the strongest signal, minimizing the risk of dead zones and ensuring consistent audio quality across large or complex venues.</p><p>Audio quality is paramount in the PTAU-2, with a cardioid pickup capsule and finely tuned EQ designed to capture vocal nuances with clarity and vibrancy. This makes the system suitable for both live performances and studio recordings, offering professionals a tool that meets their high standards.</p><p>As the flagship product of the PTAU series, the PTAU-2 reflects Phenyx Pro's dedication to delivering high-performance audio solutions at competitive prices. By incorporating feedback from previous models, the company has enhanced functionality and audio clarity, making the PTAU-2 a compelling choice for professionals seeking reliable and versatile wireless audio systems.</p><p>The introduction of the PTAU-2 is timely, as the demand for dependable and high-quality wireless audio solutions grows across various sectors. Its advanced features and user-centric design position it as a valuable asset for audio professionals and event organizers worldwide.</p>
