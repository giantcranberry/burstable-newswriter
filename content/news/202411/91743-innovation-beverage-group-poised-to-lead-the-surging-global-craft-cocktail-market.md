<p>The global craft cocktail market is on an upward trajectory, with Virtue Market Research projecting its value to escalate from $304 million in 2022 to $837.22 million by 2030, at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 13.5%. This growth is largely attributed to consumers' increasing preference for premium, locally-sourced, and sustainable products that enhance the cocktail experience.

Both brands have been recognized at prestigious competitions, underscoring their quality and innovation.</p><p>The role of bitters in crafting cocktails is pivotal, as they add complexity and balance to flavors. With consumers becoming more discerning, the demand for high-quality bitters has surged. IBG's dual-brand strategy addresses various market segments, combining quality with innovation to meet the evolving preferences of the craft beverage sector. The company's expansion efforts, including discussions with CCEP for broader European distribution, highlight its ambition to grow its global footprint.</p><p>IBG's portfolio, encompassing 60 formulations across 13 brands, reflects its commitment to catering to diverse consumer tastes in the alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverage segments.
