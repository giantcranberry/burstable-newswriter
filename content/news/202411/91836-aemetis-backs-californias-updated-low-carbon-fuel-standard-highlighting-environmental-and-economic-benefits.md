<p>Aemetis, Inc., a pioneer in renewable natural gas and renewable fuels, has publicly endorsed the proposed update to California's Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS), advocating for its adoption by the California Air Resources Board (CARB) at the forthcoming meeting on November 8, 2024. This endorsement underscores the company's commitment to low and negative carbon intensity products and its belief in the LCFS's pivotal role in achieving California's environmental and economic objectives.</p><p>Eric McAfee, Chairman and CEO of Aemetis, praised the LCFS program for its proven track record in cutting greenhouse gas emissions and enhancing air quality across California. McAfee expressed strong support for the proposed 20-year extension of LCFS goals, which he argues will not only facilitate the decarbonization of the state's transportation sector but also spur job creation and attract significant investment.</p><p>The revised LCFS is designed to complement CARB's 2045 targets, which aim for an 85% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, the creation of more than 4 million jobs, and substantial savings in health-related costs due to pollution. A key aspect of the standard is its focus on improving air quality in disadvantaged communities near pollution sources, thereby addressing environmental justice concerns.</p><p>McAfee lauded CARB's staff for their diligent work on the updated standard and urged the Board to adopt it promptly. He also highlighted the opportunity for CARB to collaborate with unions, agriculture, industry, and affected communities to enhance the LCFS, ensuring benefits for both California's environment and its residents.</p><p>Aemetis's backing of the updated LCFS reflects the increasing support for California's transition to a low-carbon economy. The company's leadership in renewable energy technologies lends considerable credibility to its endorsement. Aemetis's operations, including a California biogas digester network and pipeline system that transforms dairy waste gas into Renewable Natural Gas, along with ethanol and biodiesel production facilities in California and India, respectively, demonstrate its active role in the renewable energy sector. Additionally, the company's development of a sustainable aviation fuel and renewable diesel fuel biorefinery in California further illustrates its dedication to advancing renewable energy solutions.</p><p>The potential approval of the updated LCFS could have significant implications for the renewable fuels industry and California's economy at large, fostering innovation, drawing investment, and speeding up the development of low-carbon technologies. This could lead to greater availability of cleaner fuel options for consumers and businesses in California, along with possible long-term savings as the renewable energy sector grows.</p><p>With the CARB meeting on November 8th drawing near, the decision on the updated LCFS is highly anticipated. A favorable outcome could serve as a benchmark for other states and regions considering similar standards to address climate change and encourage sustainable economic development. The robust support from industry leaders like Aemetis underscores the widespread recognition of the need for decisive climate action. The updated LCFS, if adopted, could exemplify how environmental protection and economic growth can be harmoniously balanced, potentially inspiring comparable policies nationwide and globally.</p>
