<p>Comcast has initiated a significant rural broadband expansion in Tulare County, California, targeting approximately 6,200 locations currently lacking reliable internet access. This project, funded by a $26 million Federal Funding Account grant from the California Public Utilities Commission and Comcast's private investment, is expected to be completed by early 2026. The expansion will cover rural areas such as Alpaugh, Dinuba, and Visalia, among others, marking a pivotal step towards digital inclusion.</p><p>Beyond infrastructure, Comcast is contributing $25,000 to the Tulare County Office of Education Foundation to support digital literacy, emphasizing the project's role in educational and economic development. Pete Vander Poel of the Tulare County Board of Supervisors highlighted the project's potential to attract businesses and enhance career opportunities, while Donnette Silva Carter, CEO of the Tulare Chamber of Commerce, pointed to its transformative impact on the region's competitiveness.</p><p>This initiative is part of Comcast's broader $1 billion Project UP, aimed at connecting millions to the internet and fostering digital skills. In California, Comcast has invested over $130.5 million in digital equity programs, including WiFi-connected Lift Zones and the Internet Essentials program, which has connected over 2.2 million Californians to affordable internet since 2011.</p><p>The expansion will provide both residential and business customers in Tulare County access to Comcast's Xfinity and Comcast Business services, offering a range of internet, video, mobile, and cybersecurity solutions. This project not only promises to bridge the digital divide but also to stimulate economic development and enhance the quality of life in rural California communities.</p>
