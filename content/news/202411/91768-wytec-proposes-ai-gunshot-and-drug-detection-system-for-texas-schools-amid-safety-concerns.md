<p>Wytec (OTCQB:WYTC) has stepped forward with a proposal to the North Texas Council of Governments (NCTCOG) aiming to implement its AI Gunshot Detection System across 1,207 Texas Independent School Districts (ISDs). This initiative is part of a broader effort to enhance security in educational settings, addressing the urgent need for advanced threat detection technologies in the wake of increasing gun violence and drug epidemics.</p><p>The system, boasting over 90% accuracy in detecting gunshots from more than 500,000 live and simulated samples, also integrates drug sensor technology capable of identifying hazardous substances like fentanyl. This feature is particularly relevant given the opioid crisis's impact on youth, offering schools a tool to combat both gun violence and drug abuse simultaneously.</p><p>Through the NCTCOG's TXShare Cooperative Purchasing Program, the selected security solutions will be promoted, potentially extending their adoption beyond Texas. This move could mark a significant shift in how educational institutions nationwide approach safety, setting a precedent for the integration of technology in security protocols.</p><p>Parallel to its security initiatives, Wytec is advancing its financial strategy with plans to uplist to the Nasdaq Capital Markets, supported by a $7 million capital injection and access to an additional $100 million in funding. This financial backing, coupled with a strategic partnership with Lemko Corporation, underscores Wytec's commitment to expanding its technological and operational capabilities.</p><p>The collaboration with Lemko, which brings together over 50 patents related to software-defined architectures, is poised to enhance the effectiveness of Wytec's solutions. Robert Sanchez, Wytec's CTO, and Brian Ponte, Vice President of Sales and Marketing for Lemko, both highlight the potential of their combined efforts to significantly improve safety for children across the U.S. and internationally.</p><p>As Wytec's proposal undergoes consideration, its implications extend far beyond the immediate benefits to Texas schools. The adoption of such comprehensive safety systems could inspire nationwide changes in school security measures, offering a blueprint for addressing the dual challenges of gun violence and drug epidemics in educational environments.</p>
