<p>NAVEX, a global leader in integrated risk and compliance management software, has announced the release of a suite of solutions specifically designed for small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs). These solutions aim to assist SMBs in establishing and scaling their governance, risk, and compliance (GRC) programs, a critical need as these businesses face increasing regulatory scrutiny and the pressure to comply with complex standards, especially when pursuing partnerships or growth opportunities like mergers and acquisitions.</p><p>With a client base of over 6,000 SMBs worldwide, NAVEX has utilized its vast experience to tackle the unique compliance challenges these businesses face. A.G. Lambert, NAVEX Chief Product Officer, pointed out the overwhelming nature of global regulations for smaller entities, using the EU Whistleblower Protection Directive as a case in point. In response, NAVEX has developed solutions such as WhistleB, which provides essential functionalities like report intake, efficient reporting, and case resolution, offering SMBs compliant and easy-to-use options.</p><p>The timing of NAVEX's focus on SMBs is pertinent, as their research indicates that 42% of risk and compliance professionals in SMBs juggle responsibilities beyond compliance. This finding highlights the often reactive stance SMBs take towards risk and compliance, attributed to the perceived complexity and scarcity of dedicated resources. NAVEX warns that neglecting compliance can lead to severe repercussions, including financial penalties, damage to reputation, and missed business opportunities.</p><p>To comply with EU whistleblowing regulations, which require businesses with 50 or more employees to offer a confidential reporting channel, NAVEX's WhistleB solution stands out. This platform ensures that whistleblower reports are handled in line with legal requirements, offering businesses reassurance. Features of NAVEX WhistleB include secure report intake, compliant incident management, and guaranteed confidentiality, fostering trust in speak-up initiatives.</p><p>Beyond whistleblowing, NAVEX equips SMBs with a broad array of tools to cultivate risk-aware cultures. These include compliance training, policy management, and procedural guidance, enabling businesses to develop GRC programs that not only meet regulatory demands but also encourage employee engagement.</p><p>For SMBs eager to bolster their compliance frameworks, NAVEX has made its WhistleB system available for online purchase. The company also provides a wealth of resources to aid SMBs in effective compliance management, such as a <a href='https://www.navex.com' rel='nofollow' target='_blank'>Guide to SMB compliance</a>, analyses on <a href='https://www.navex.com' rel='nofollow' target='_blank'>evolving cybersecurity risks</a>, and a snapshot of the <a href='https://www.navex.com' rel='nofollow' target='_blank'>2024 State of SMB compliance</a>.</p><p>As regulatory frameworks grow more intricate, NAVEX's dedicated solutions for SMBs mark a pivotal advancement in the GRC domain. By delivering scalable, comprehensive, and accessible compliance tools, NAVEX seeks to enable smaller businesses to tackle modern regulatory challenges, paving the way for their sustained growth and success in a business environment under increasing scrutiny.</p>
