<p>The 3rd UNESCO World Open Educational Resources (OER) Congress has officially begun at the Dubai World Trade Centre, marking a historic first for the Arab World. This pivotal event, organized by UNESCO in partnership with the Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Knowledge Foundation (MBRF), has attracted over 500 participants from around the globe, including ministers, academics, and private sector leaders. Their collective mission is to explore how open solutions and artificial intelligence (AI) can be harnessed to ensure inclusive access to knowledge for all.</p><p>Under the theme 'Digital Public Goods: Open Solutions and AI for Inclusive Access to Knowledge,' the congress is set to unfold over two days, featuring a series of high-level panels, breakout sessions, and expert discussions. These sessions are meticulously designed to advance the cause of equitable and sustainable education through the innovative use of OER and cutting-edge technologies. The significance of this congress cannot be overstated, as it holds the potential to redefine the future of global education by addressing critical challenges and fostering inclusivity through the strategic application of open resources and AI.</p><p>The opening ceremony was graced by notable figures such as His Excellency Abdul Rahman Al Awar and Dr. Tawfik Jelassi, whose speeches underscored the transformative power of OER in overcoming educational barriers worldwide. A ministerial panel, chaired by Louise Haxthausen, further enriched the dialogue by examining policies that encourage the use of openly licensed learning content, offering a glimpse into how nations are innovating to promote inclusion and accessibility in education.</p><p>Key discussions at the congress have revolved around the integration of OER and generative AI for digital inclusion, the value of openly licensed learning content, and the implementation of the 2019 Recommendation on OER. These conversations have shed light on the role of technology in achieving gender parity, supporting language inclusion, and meeting the unique needs of vulnerable populations. The congress is poised to culminate in the Dubai Declaration for Action on OER, a landmark document that will outline actionable steps toward achieving inclusive and equitable quality education for all.</p><p>Highlighting the global impact of OER, the congress showcased successful initiatives from countries like Cuba, Madagascar, Malaysia, and Morocco. These examples illustrate the diverse and innovative approaches being taken to ensure that knowledge is accessible to everyone, regardless of geographical or socio-economic barriers. The UNESCO World OER Congress stands as a testament to the power of collaboration and innovation in shaping a more inclusive future for education worldwide.</p>
