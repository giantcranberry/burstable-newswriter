<p>Before Health Intelligence, Ltd. has unveiled Antshrike™, a mobile health application leveraging artificial intelligence to forecast heart attacks and strokes with remarkable precision. This innovation processes biometric data from Apple smartphones and smartwatches, offering early alerts for cardiovascular events, which are the leading cause of death globally. The app's development is rooted in extensive research, analyzing over 130 billion data points alongside CDC data, to deliver personalized, real-time risk assessments.</p><p>Antshrike™ stands out for its passive monitoring capability, ensuring users' daily routines remain undisturbed while their health status is continuously evaluated. This feature, combined with an 85% predictive accuracy rate, positions the app as a transformative tool in heart disease management. Privacy concerns are mitigated through HIPAA-compliant data preprocessing on the user's device, safeguarding sensitive health information.</p><p>The app's AI technology operates on two levels: a static layer for initial risk assessment based on user-input data and a dynamic layer that analyzes real-time biometric data. This dual approach provides a comprehensive evaluation of cardiovascular health, considering both long-term risks and immediate physiological changes. Dr. Ekaterina Mitricheva, CEO of Before Health Intelligence, highlights the app's potential to address the urgent need for predictive and preventive measures against cardiovascular diseases.</p><p>Antshrike™ is not only a breakthrough for individual users but also a valuable asset for healthcare providers, enabling earlier interventions that could mitigate or prevent cardiovascular events. Its freemium model, launching in the U.S. in 2025, aims to broaden access to this life-saving technology. As wearable technology becomes more ubiquitous, Antshrike™ exemplifies how AI can revolutionize health monitoring and management, paving the way for future applications in predictive healthcare.</p>
