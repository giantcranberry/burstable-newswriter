<p>ZenaTech, Inc. (Nasdaq: ZENA) (FSE: 49Q), a leader in AI drone solutions and enterprise SaaS, has taken a significant step towards expanding its global market presence by listing its common shares on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange (FSE) under the symbol '49Q' as of October 31, 2024. This dual listing is poised to open new avenues for European investors to engage with the company, enhancing liquidity and trading activities.</p><p>CEO Shaun Passley, Ph.D., highlighted the strategic rationale behind this move, emphasizing the benefits of increased exposure and accessibility for European investors. The FSE, being the largest exchange in Germany and the third largest in Europe, offers a robust platform for ZenaTech to amplify its investor following and support its growth trajectory in AI drone solutions and enterprise SaaS applications.</p><p>With a solid foundation in Europe, including an office in Germany and a burgeoning customer base across law enforcement, government, and industrial sectors, ZenaTech's listing on the FSE's Xetra platform—a leading electronic trading system—further solidifies its commitment to global market expansion. This platform's connectivity to major European financial hubs is anticipated to boost trading volume and investor interest in ZenaTech's shares.</p><p>The company's subsidiary, ZenaDrone, is pioneering autonomous drone technologies, such as the ZenaDrone 1000 and IQ Nano, which leverage AI and machine learning for diverse applications from agriculture to logistics. This technological prowess, combined with the strategic FSE listing, positions ZenaTech to meet the escalating demand for innovative solutions in inspection, monitoring, and safety processes across industries.</p><p>This development occurs amidst a surge in the global drone market, fueled by AI advancements and sector-wide adoption. ZenaTech's established presence in North America, Europe, and the UAE, along with its expanding partner network, underscores its potential to capitalize on this trend. For European investors, the FSE listing presents a unique opportunity to invest in a company at the forefront of AI, drone technology, and enterprise software solutions.</p><p>ZenaTech's dual listing reflects a broader trend among technology firms seeking to diversify their investor base through international exchanges. This strategic move not only enhances the company's visibility in the European tech and investment landscapes but also sets a precedent for other firms aiming to strengthen their global market position. As ZenaTech advances with this initiative, its performance and ability to leverage this expanded market access will be closely monitored by investors and industry observers alike.</p>
