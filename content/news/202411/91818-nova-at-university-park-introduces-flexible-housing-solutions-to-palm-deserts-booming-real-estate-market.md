<p>The Palm Desert real estate market is experiencing a notable uplift with the launch of Nova at University Park, a new residential development by Woodbridge Pacific Group (WPG). This project stands out for its high-style homes at accessible prices, starting in the high $600,000s, and introduces flexible living solutions through Accessory Dwelling Units (ADUs). These ADUs are designed to accommodate multi-generational living, long-term guests, or serve as rental income sources, featuring self-contained living spaces with essential amenities.</p><p>Todd Cunningham, WPG President, highlighted the ADUs' appeal to a broad spectrum of buyers, including empty nesters and first-time homeowners, by addressing current and future lifestyle needs. The development's strategic location near the 10 Freeway enhances its attractiveness, providing easy access to medical facilities, schools, and retail areas like the El Paseo Shopping District.</p><p>Residents will enjoy access to The Grove, a comprehensive amenity center with resort-style pools, fitness facilities, and outdoor recreational spaces. The development also benefits from proximity to local parks, adding to the quality of life for its community members. WPG is facilitating the purchase process with financing options and incentives, supported by Jeff Weirsma from US Bank.</p><p>Nova at University Park marks a significant advancement in Palm Desert's housing market, offering a blend of quality, flexibility, and community amenities. This development not only meets the diverse needs of today's homebuyers but also contributes to the region's real estate growth, making it a compelling option for investment in the California desert area.</p>
