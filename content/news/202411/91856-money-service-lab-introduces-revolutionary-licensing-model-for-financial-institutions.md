<p>The financial technology sector is witnessing a transformative development with Money Service Lab (MSL) introducing a novel licensing model that allows banks, credit card issuers, and other financial entities to act as their own issuing processors for major card schemes such as Visa, MasterCard, and Discover. This innovation comes after MSL achieved MasterCard Europe certification and is in the process of securing others, marking a significant milestone in the payment processing industry.</p><p>With the European Central Bank reporting over 72 billion card transactions in Europe in 2023, the demand for efficient processing solutions is undeniable. MSL's platform addresses this need by offering three operational models: a fully managed service, a hybrid approach, and a licensed model that grants clients access to source code and customization options. This flexibility is designed to meet the diverse needs of financial institutions, enabling them to scale operations efficiently.</p><p>Lee Britton, Strategy Director at MSL, highlighted the company's foresight in recognizing the surge in card-based transactions and the existing market gap. The integration of the ENGINÂ© switch from Muscato Corporation, which processes about 15% of U.S. financial transactions, underscores the platform's capability to handle approximately 9,000 transactions per second. This technological backbone ensures scalability and reliability for clients.</p><p>MSL's CEO, Conor Doyle, pointed out the rapid growth of card transactions and the limited number of global processors, many of which rely on outdated technologies. The platform's features, including multi-currency processing, spend controls, and advanced fraud monitoring, position it as a comprehensive solution for modern financial institutions. The 'Compliance as a Service' system further enhances its appeal by addressing risk and AML requirements.</p><p>The introduction of this licensing model could significantly lower processing costs for financial institutions, fostering a more competitive and innovative market. By enabling institutions to process their own cards, MSL is not only challenging the status quo but also paving the way for a future where financial transactions are more efficient and cost-effective for all stakeholders involved.</p>
