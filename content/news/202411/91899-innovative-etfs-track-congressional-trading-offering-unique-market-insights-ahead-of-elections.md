These ETFs track the trading activities of congressional members and their spouses, leveraging the disclosure requirements of the STOCK Act to offer a unique perspective on potential market trends influenced by political insiders.</p><p>As of October 25, 2024, both ETFs have demonstrated strong performance, with KRUZ returning 14.33% and NANC delivering 25.24%, performances that are comparable to major indices. The sector allocations of these funds reflect the differing priorities of the two major U.S. political parties, with NANC heavily invested in technology and KRUZ showing a broader distribution across sectors including financial services and energy.</p><p>Notably, both ETFs share investments in AI leaders Nvidia and Microsoft, indicating a bipartisan consensus on the significance of artificial intelligence in the economy. This overlap suggests that certain technological advancements are viewed as critical across political divides.</p><p>For investors, NANC and KRUZ represent a turnkey solution to tap into the collective intelligence of congressional insiders regarding future U.S. policy and its economic implications.
