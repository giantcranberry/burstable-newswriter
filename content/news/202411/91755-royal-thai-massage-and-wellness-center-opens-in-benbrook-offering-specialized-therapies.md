<p>The Royal Thai Massage and Wellness Center has officially opened its doors at the Salon and Spa Galleria Benbrook in Benbrook, Texas, marking a significant addition to the local wellness industry. Founded by licensed massage therapist Orawan Singhan, the center specializes in a variety of massage therapies, including Swedish, deep-tissue, traditional Thai, and Thai combination treatments, with a strong emphasis on pain relief and mobility improvement.</p><p>Singhan's inspiration for entering the massage therapy field stemmed from a personal experience of aiding her grandfather in Thailand, which led her to pursue formal training at ELM Health Institute in Fort Worth. Her center now offers traditional Thai massage, a service particularly beneficial for athletes and those looking to enhance physical performance, through unique techniques such as back-walking and yoga-inspired stretches.</p><p>In addition to its specialized services, the Royal Thai Massage and Wellness Center is committed to serving the community by offering a 10-percent discount to veterans and first responders. To celebrate its grand opening, new customers can choose between a 10-percent discount or complimentary add-ons like hot stone, aroma oil, or tiger balm treatments.</p><p>Located within the Salon and Spa Galleria Benbrook, the center provides easy access, ample parking, and handicap-friendly facilities, serving not only Benbrook but also surrounding communities such as Granbury, Fort Worth, Aledo, Whiskey Flats, and Cresson. This opening underscores the expansion of Salon and Spa Galleria, a company that supports independent beauty and wellness professionals across 23 U.S. locations, reflecting the increasing demand for personalized wellness services.</p><p>The establishment of the Royal Thai Massage and Wellness Center is a testament to the evolving wellness industry in Texas, offering residents access to a blend of traditional and modern massage techniques. Its focus on alternative therapies for pain management and well-being aligns with growing public interest in non-traditional health solutions, positioning the center as a valuable resource for the community and beyond.</p>
