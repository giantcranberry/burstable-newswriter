<p>Meta Platforms Inc. is currently embroiled in a pivotal antitrust trial initiated by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), challenging the company's dominance in the social media market. The trial scrutinizes Meta's acquisitions of Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014, which the FTC claims were strategic moves to eliminate competition and maintain a monopoly. This legal battle holds significant implications for the tech industry, potentially setting new precedents for how large technology companies can grow and manage competition.</p><p>The FTC's case against Meta argues that the acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp were illegal attempts to stifle competition, thereby harming consumers and the market.

The proceedings are expected to shed light on antitrust regulations in the digital age, offering insights into how regulatory bodies might approach market competition in the future.
