<p>The Canadian aerospace and technology sectors are at a pivotal juncture, with leaders from across the nation gathering at the inaugural Canadian Space Launch Conference (CSLC) in Ottawa. This landmark event aims to chart a course for Canada to develop sovereign space launch capabilities, a critical step for the nation to secure its place in the rapidly expanding global space economy. Currently, Canada stands as the only G7 and Five Eyes nation without autonomous launch capabilities, a gap that poses both a challenge and an opportunity for national leadership in space.</p><p>Dr. Doug Milburn, Co-Founder and Chairman of Protocase and ProtoSpace Mfg., is set to highlight Canada's aerospace manufacturing prowess in his lightning talk, titled 'Canada's Aerospace Manufacturing Advantage - Making the Impossible, Possible.' His presentation will underscore the urgent need for Canada to establish independent space launch infrastructure, a move that could significantly enhance national security, create jobs, and foster technological independence.</p><p>The conference boasts an impressive lineup of speakers, including Brigadier-General Christopher Horner, Commander of 3 Canadian Space Division, who will deliver the opening keynote, and Brian Gallant, CEO of Space Canada, who will provide the closing address. These discussions will cover a broad spectrum of topics, from defense and security to commercial space development and regulatory readiness, reflecting the multidisciplinary approach required to advance Canada's space sector.</p><p>Sponsored by industry leaders such as ProtoSpace Mfg., Galaxia, and Spaceport Canada, the CSLC represents a united front in the push for Canada to become a spacefaring nation. With the global space economy projected to surpass $1 trillion by 2040, the stakes could not be higher. Dr. Milburn's call to action emphasizes the time-sensitive nature of this opportunity, urging Canada to transition from a passive observer to an active leader in space exploration and technology.</p><p>The Canadian Space Launch Conference is more than just a meeting of minds; it's a strategic pivot towards securing Canada's future in space. By investing in space infrastructure and innovation, Canada has the potential to reshape its technological and economic trajectory, ensuring its competitiveness and sovereignty in the new space age.</p>
