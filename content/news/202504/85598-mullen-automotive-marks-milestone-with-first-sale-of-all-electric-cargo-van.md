<p>Mullen Automotive has achieved a significant milestone with the first sale of its all-electric Mullen ONE Class 1 cargo van to Global Expert Shipping, a Glendale, California-based international freight forwarding company. This sale, conducted through Mullen's dealership partner Pritchard Automotive, represents a pivotal moment in the company's strategy to penetrate the commercial electric vehicle market. The move by Global Expert Shipping to incorporate Mullen's electric vehicle into its fleet underscores the logistics industry's increasing focus on sustainability and operational cost reduction.</p><p>The Mullen ONE cargo van, along with the Class 3 Mullen THREE truck, meets all U.S. safety and emissions standards, having received critical certifications from the California Air Resource Board (CARB) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). These certifications facilitate the broad commercial deployment of Mullen's vehicles, positioning the company as a competitive player in the electric vehicle sector. Furthermore, Mullen has secured significant financial incentives, including federal EV tax credits of up to $7,500 per vehicle and a CARB-issued HVIP approval for the Mullen THREE, offering up to a $45,000 cash voucher at purchase, enhancing the attractiveness of its vehicles to potential buyers.</p><p>With commercial vehicle production underway at its Tunica, Mississippi facility since August 2023, Mullen has expanded its dealer network to seven partners across strategic U.S. markets. This expansion is crucial for supporting sales and service operations nationwide. Additionally, the company's Tunica manufacturing center has been granted Foreign Trade Zone (FTZ) status, providing benefits like duty deferment and elimination on exported vehicles, further solidifying Mullen's competitive edge in the electric vehicle market.</p><p>This development is not just a win for Mullen Automotive but also signals a broader shift in the logistics and transportation sectors towards adopting electric vehicles. The transition to electric fleets can significantly reduce carbon emissions and operational costs, aligning with global sustainability goals. For businesses in the logistics industry, Mullen's advancements offer a viable pathway to greener operations, potentially setting a new standard for commercial transportation.</p>
