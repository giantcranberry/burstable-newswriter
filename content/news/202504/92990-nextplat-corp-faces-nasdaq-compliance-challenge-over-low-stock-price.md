<p>NextPlat Corp (NASDAQ: NXPL), a global e-commerce platform specializing in technology and healthcare sectors, has recently been issued a formal notice by Nasdaq Stock Market LLC. The notice highlights the company's failure to maintain a closing bid price of at least $1.00 per share for 30 consecutive business days, breaching Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2). This development places NextPlat in a critical 180-day compliance period, set to conclude on October 27, 2025, during which the company must achieve a closing bid price of $1.00 or more for at least 10 consecutive business days to regain compliance.</p><p>The implications of this notice are significant for NextPlat and its stakeholders.
