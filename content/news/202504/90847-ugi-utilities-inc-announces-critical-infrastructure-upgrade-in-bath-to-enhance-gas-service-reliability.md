<p>UGI Utilities, Inc. is preparing to start a pivotal infrastructure upgrade project in Bath next week, targeting the replacement of gas mains and the enhancement of system reliability. The initiative, kicking off on April 7, will specifically affect West Main Street between Mulberry Street and Race Street, with an anticipated completion by early May. This project underscores UGI's dedication to ensuring the safety and reliability of utility services for its extensive customer base, which exceeds 760,000 individuals.</p><p>The construction, scheduled from Monday to Friday between 7 a.m. and 5 p.m., is expected to lead to road closures, traffic delays, and parking limitations. These disruptions necessitate adjustments for local drivers, residents, and business operators during the construction phase. Moreover, the infrastructure overhaul presents a valuable chance for properties along the project's path to switch to natural gas, aligning with UGI's methodical strategy that includes property inspections and equipment relighting, possibly causing brief service interruptions.</p><p>While the project's timeline is adaptable, with completion dates contingent on weather and work progress, the upgrades are a testament to UGI's commitment to modernizing the gas distribution system and elevating service quality. Affected parties are advised to prepare for possible alterations in travel and service during the construction period, marking a significant step towards infrastructure modernization and improved utility services in the Bath area.</p>
