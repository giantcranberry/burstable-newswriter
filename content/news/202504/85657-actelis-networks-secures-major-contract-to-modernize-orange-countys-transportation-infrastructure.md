<p>Actelis Networks has recently been awarded a significant contract to modernize the intelligent transportation system (ITS) infrastructure in Orange County, California. This development highlights the company's expanding role in enhancing traffic management and smart city technologies across the United States. Orange County, with its population exceeding 3 million, stands to benefit from improved traffic flow and safety, thanks to Actelis's hybrid-fiber technology. This technology not only delivers fiber-grade performance over existing infrastructure but also offers considerable cost savings and faster deployment times.</p><p>The contract, facilitated through partner Western Systems, is part of a series of successful deployments by Actelis in cities like Washington D.C., Seattle, and Ventura County. These projects demonstrate the company's capability to meet the growing demand for smart city solutions. Actelis's innovative approach has also caught the attention of the defense and railway sectors, with recent orders for military base modernization and Positive Train Control implementation, respectively.</p><p>Financially, Actelis is on an upward trajectory, with fiscal year 2024 revenue jumping 38% to $7.8 million and gross margins improving significantly. This financial health, combined with a reduction in operating expenses and loss per share, paints a promising picture for the company's future. Analyst Theodore O'Neill from Litchfield Hills Research has endorsed Actelis's potential, maintaining a Buy rating with a $5 price target.</p><p>The global smart cities market, projected to reach $300 billion by 2032, with the ITS segment expected to hit $65.33 billion, presents a vast opportunity for Actelis. The company's strategic positioning and technological prowess make it a key player in the infrastructure modernization wave. For business and technology leaders, Actelis's progress signals the importance of investing in smart infrastructure to address urban challenges and foster sustainable development.</p>
