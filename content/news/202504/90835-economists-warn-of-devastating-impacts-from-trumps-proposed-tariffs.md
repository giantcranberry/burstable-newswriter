<p>Prominent economists and policy experts are raising concerns over President Donald Trump's latest trade policy, a 10% across-the-board tariff, warning it may lead to severe economic repercussions. The policy has sparked fears over rising production costs, potential market instability, and a misunderstanding of international trade dynamics. Jason Furman, former chairman of the Council of Economic Advisors, highlighted the importance of imports for economic competitiveness, noting they offer consumers more choices, lower prices, and help American companies produce higher-quality goods more efficiently.</p><p>The automotive industry is particularly vulnerable, with about 40% of auto parts used in US manufacturing sourced internationally. Tariffs could significantly increase production costs, making American products less competitive globally. Wall Street's reaction has been negative, with the stock market reportedly losing over $4 trillion since the tariffs were introduced, amid warnings of a potential recession and bearish market trends.</p><p>Constitutional questions have also emerged, with experts suggesting the tariff implementation may exceed presidential authority. The US Constitution grants Congress the power to impose tariffs, with exceptions only in wartime emergenciesâ€”a situation many argue does not apply to current trade relations. The majority of economists advocate for free trade and globalization, seeing them as crucial for economic growth and international cooperation. The unilateral approach to tariffs contradicts these principles and risks damaging diplomatic and economic ties with key partners.</p><p>As discussions continue, the long-term economic effects of these tariffs remain a pressing concern for policymakers, economists, and the public, highlighting the delicate balance between protecting domestic industries and fostering global economic stability.</p>
