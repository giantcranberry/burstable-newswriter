<p>As outdoor projects commence with the arrival of spring, utility safety experts are highlighting the necessity of calling 811 before any digging begins. This precautionary measure is designed to prevent serious injuries, avoid utility service disruptions, and mitigate the risk of life-threatening accidents. A survey conducted by the Common Ground Alliance has brought to light a startling figure: approximately 27 million homeowners in the U.S. intend to undertake digging projects this year without notifying utility locator services, a decision that poses significant risks not only to individuals but also to communities at large.</p><p>In Pennsylvania, the law requires both homeowners and contractors to contact 811 at least three business days prior to excavation. The service is provided free of charge to homeowners, while contractors are subject to a nominal annual fee. Essential details such as the project's location, the nature of the work, the excavation method, and the project's timeline must be provided when making the call. This process ensures that underground utility lines—ranging from gas and water to electric and telecommunications—are accurately marked with paint or flags, thereby reducing the likelihood of accidental damage during digging activities.</p><p>Chris Brown, UGI Utilities Vice President of Operations, underscores the universal applicability of this safety protocol: "UGI wants every dig on every project to be a safe one. Whether it is a small project or a major one, the same rule applies: call 811." Beyond underground utilities, experts also caution workers to exercise vigilance around above-ground electrical facilities, where contact can have fatal consequences. As National Safe Digging Month progresses, the message is clear: prioritizing safety by calling 811 before digging is a simple yet effective step that can save lives and prevent unnecessary disruptions.</p>
