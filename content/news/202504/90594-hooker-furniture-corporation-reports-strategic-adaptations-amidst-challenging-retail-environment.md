<p>Hooker Furniture Corporation (NASDAQ: HOFT) has announced its fourth-quarter fiscal year 2025 financial results, showcasing a resilient performance in a complex retail environment. The company reported a revenue of $104.5 million, a 7.9% increase year-over-year, slightly surpassing consensus estimates. This growth is primarily due to additional operating days compared to the previous year, despite facing macroeconomic challenges such as fluctuating interest rates, housing shortages, and elevated home prices.</p><p>In response to these challenges, Hooker Furniture has implemented significant cost-reduction strategies, achieving a 10% reduction in fixed costs, approximately $10.0 million, with plans for an additional $10.0 million in savings through warehouse optimization and other initiatives by fiscal year 2027. The company's financial strategy also includes maintaining a consistent dividend approach, currently at $0.23 per share, marking a 4.4% increase from the previous year.</p><p>Balance sheet management has been a key focus for Hooker Furniture, with debt levels reduced from $76.3 million to $70.3 million over fiscal year 2025. The company ended the quarter with $6.3 million in cash, reflecting strategic inventory build and increased accounts receivable. Despite a decrease in order backlog to $52.6 million from $71.8 million in the previous year's fourth quarter, management remains optimistic, citing improved warehousing in Vietnam and the exit from the Savannah warehouse as pivotal in reducing lead times significantly.</p><p>Valuation analyses suggest a potential share value range between $14.22 and $21.47, indicating a cautiously optimistic outlook for the company. Hooker Furniture's strategic focus on operational cost control, supply chain efficiency, and financial flexibility positions it to potentially capitalize on opportunities as market conditions stabilize, underscoring its adaptability in a challenging industry landscape.</p>
