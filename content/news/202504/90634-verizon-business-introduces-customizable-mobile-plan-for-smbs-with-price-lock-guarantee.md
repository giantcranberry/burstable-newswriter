<p>Verizon Business has introduced the My Biz Plan, a groundbreaking mobile plan designed specifically for small and midsized businesses (SMBs), offering a level of customization and cost management previously unseen in carrier offerings. This plan allows businesses to tailor their wireless solutions with a base package of unlimited calling, data, and texting, complemented by optional add-ons such as international connectivity and productivity tools, which can be adjusted as business needs evolve.</p><p>A significant feature of the My Biz Plan is the 3-year price lock guarantee, ensuring that the core monthly plan pricing remains unchanged, providing businesses with financial predictability in an often volatile market. Additional benefits include built-in mobile internet security to safeguard against malware and phishing attacks, with pricing starting at an affordable $29 per month for businesses with five or more lines.</p><p>From April 10 to June 10, Verizon is offering an introductory 15% discount on the core monthly plan for new lines, which, when combined with auto pay and paper-free billing, could reduce the cost to as low as $25 per line. This initiative comes in response to findings from the 2024 State of Small Business Survey, highlighting the challenges SMBs face in balancing cost management with the need for advanced technological tools.</p><p>Iris Meijer, Chief Product & Marketing Officer at Verizon Business, highlighted the company's dedication to supporting the unique needs of small businesses through flexible and cost-effective communication solutions. The My Biz Plan is a testament to Verizon's commitment to empowering SMBs with the tools they need to thrive in a competitive business environment.</p>
