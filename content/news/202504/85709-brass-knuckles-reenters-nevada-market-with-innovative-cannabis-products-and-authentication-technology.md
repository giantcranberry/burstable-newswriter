Brass Knuckles is set to offer its premium cannabis products across several Las Vegas retail locations, including Planet 13, Jardin, Shango, Inyo, and Cookies Flamingo, introducing consumers to high-quality extracts and innovative technology.</p><p>Founder Mike Healy highlights the brand's dedication to quality and innovation, with the introduction of three distinct extraction types: Super Premium Distillate, Live Liquid Diamonds, and Live Resin. The All-In-One (AIO) hardware further exemplifies Brass Knuckles' commitment to enhancing the consumer experience, setting a new benchmark in product development within the cannabis industry.</p><p>A standout feature of this relaunch is the adoption of Lucid Green's authentication technology.
