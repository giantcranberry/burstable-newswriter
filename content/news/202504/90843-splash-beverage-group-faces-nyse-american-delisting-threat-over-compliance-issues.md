<p>Splash Beverage Group, known for its diverse portfolio including Copa di Vino wine and SALT flavored tequilas, has encountered a significant regulatory hurdle. The NYSE American has notified the company of its failure to meet compliance standards by the April 6, 2025, deadline, specifically citing violations of Sections 1003(a)(i), (ii), and (iii) of the Listed Company Manual. This development places the company's listing status in jeopardy, with delisting as a potential outcome if an appeal is unsuccessful.</p><p>The company has swiftly moved to address the issue, planning to appeal the NYSE American's determination within the stipulated seven-day window. Splash Beverage Group anticipates the appeals process to span 60 to 90 days, during which it aims to rectify the shareholder equity deficiencies identified by the exchange. While the company expresses confidence in overcoming these challenges, it acknowledges the uncertainty surrounding the appeal's outcome.</p><p>For stakeholders and the broader beverage industry, the situation underscores the importance of regulatory compliance for publicly traded companies. A successful appeal would allow Splash Beverage Group to continue trading its common stock and warrants on NYSE American, preserving its access to capital markets. Conversely, delisting could limit the company's financial flexibility and impact its brand portfolio's growth trajectory. This scenario highlights the delicate balance between corporate governance and operational strategy in the competitive beverage sector.</p>
