<p>Vycor Medical, a leader in neurosurgical solutions, has announced a 10% increase in revenue for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2024, marking a significant milestone in its financial performance. This growth is largely due to the company's expanded presence in the United States healthcare market, with its Vycor Medical division generating $1,515,744 in revenue. The division's success is underscored by a 17% growth in US hospital sales and the addition of 11 new hospitals to its client base.</p><p>The company's flagship product, the ViewSite Brain Access System (VBAS), has been a key driver of this growth, supported by the publication of eight peer-reviewed studies in 2024. Among these, a 106-patient study highlighted VBAS's effectiveness in glioma removal, while a 22-patient study demonstrated minimal complications in colloid cyst surgery, further validating the system's clinical value.</p><p>Financially, Vycor Medical maintained robust gross margins of approximately 90%, reflecting its operational efficiency and the high value proposition of its products. However, the company also reported an increase in non-GAAP operating expenses to $1,340,967, attributed to investments in regulatory compliance, human resources, and scientific consulting.</p><p>In a strategic development, Vycor Medical has engaged Maxim Group LLC to explore corporate development opportunities, including potential strategic acquisitions, partnerships, and the possibility of uplisting to a US exchange. This move signals the company's ambition to further expand its market presence and enhance shareholder value.</p><p>While the NovaVision division, focusing on vision rehabilitation therapies, contributed $73,580 in revenue, its high gross margin of 94% indicates strong potential for future growth. Despite facing potential challenges from recent trade tariffs, Vycor Medical's US-based manufacturing is expected to mitigate direct import-related risks, ensuring the company remains focused on its mission to deliver innovative, minimally invasive surgical solutions.</p>
