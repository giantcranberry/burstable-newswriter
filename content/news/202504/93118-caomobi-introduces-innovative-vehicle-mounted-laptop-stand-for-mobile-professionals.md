A distinctive weight-distributing structure ensures unparalleled stability, distinguishing it from conventional car mounts.</p><p>Among its key features is an adjustable clamp mechanism that facilitates easy positioning of devices in both horizontal and vertical orientations with minimal adjustments. The inclusion of non-slip padding not only protects the steering wheel and the laptop but also enhances security during use.</p><p>What sets the Caro STAND apart is its user-friendly design.
