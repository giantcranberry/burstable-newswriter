<p>A federal whistleblower has taken a stand against the bankruptcy proceedings of Wellpath Holdings, Inc., with a 300-page emergency motion suite that alleges systemic procedural and constitutional irregularities. Dr. Kanwar Partap Singh Gill, a board-certified physician, filed the motion in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas, challenging what he describes as a manipulative bankruptcy process aimed at extinguishing billions in legal exposure by private equity firm H.I.G. Capital.</p><p>Between April 14 and April 22, 2025, Dr. Gill submitted eight verified filings that raised objections including allegations of ADA retaliation, ERISA fiduciary breaches, and governance violations. He claims these filings were not publicly docketed, potentially misleading stakeholders into believing there was a creditor consensus. The comprehensive 75-in-One Verified Emergency Motion Suite seeks to strike plan documents, invalidate ballots, disqualify legal representatives, and enforce constitutional due process rights, invoking protections under the Americans with Disabilities Act, ERISA, and bankruptcy statutes.</p><p>With a confirmation hearing set for April 30, 2025, Dr. Gill insists that legal proceedings cannot proceed lawfully while 75 verified motions remain unresolved. He has outlined his intention to explore post-confirmation remedies through appellate review and potential federal prosecution. This legal challenge not only questions the integrity of Wellpath Holdings' bankruptcy proceedings but also casts a spotlight on broader systemic vulnerabilities within judicial and corporate restructuring processes, with implications for corporate governance and legal accountability in the business and technology sectors.</p>
