<p>Tiago Capelo Monteiro, a 21-year-old student at the NOVA School of Science and Technology, has emerged as a symbol of hope for young individuals facing personal adversities.

Monteiro's portfolio includes publishing more than 20 technical articles, earning Top Open Source Contributor honors for three years straight, and holding the position of Vice Chair at his university's IEEE branch.</p><p>Monteiro's narrative, "From Failure to International Success: How Online Learning Platforms Saved My Life," has inspired a global audience.
