<p>UGI Utilities, Inc. has announced a comprehensive gas main replacement project in Easton, starting April 23, 2025, with the goal of enhancing the reliability and safety of natural gas services. This initiative, expected to last until mid-September, will focus on several key streets, including Northampton Street, North Union Street, North 6th Street, Church Street, and North 5th Street, potentially transforming the local infrastructure landscape.</p><p>The project will involve construction activities from Monday to Friday, 7 am to 5 pm, leading to road closures, detours, and possible traffic disruptions. Residents and businesses in the vicinity may face temporary interruptions in natural gas service as UGI conducts equipment inspections and system relights to ensure a seamless transition.</p><p>This infrastructure upgrade presents an opportunity for property owners in the affected areas to switch to natural gas, offering a more efficient and possibly cost-effective energy solution. The completion of the project, however, is subject to weather conditions and the progress of the ongoing work, with UGI Utilities committed to maintaining flexibility in the timeline while ensuring the upgrades are thoroughly implemented.</p><p>Representing a significant investment in infrastructure, this project highlights UGI Utilities' dedication to its customer base of over 760,000 individuals. By modernizing the gas main infrastructure, the utility company aims to not only improve service reliability and safety but also expand energy options for communities within its service region.</p>
