<p>Cboe Global Markets is organizing a virtual webinar focused on Zero Days to Expiration (0DTE) options, designed to provide traders with in-depth knowledge on managing market volatility and refining trading strategies. The session will be led by Henry Schwartz, Vice President of Derivatives Market Intelligence at Cboe, who will explore the development of 0DTE options since their introduction in 2005. Originally created to expand risk management methods, these options have evolved significantly, now offering daily trading opportunities beyond the initial weekly S&P 500 Index options.</p><p>The webinar will cover the expansion of 0DTE options to include expirations every weekday, a milestone achieved in 2022. This advancement allows traders to execute more precise, same-day trading strategies, a feature especially pertinent in today's volatile market environment. With economic policies and global trade tensions contributing to market unpredictability, 0DTE options present a timely tool for traders to adapt swiftly to market changes.</p><p>Among the advantages of 0DTE options are reduced capital requirements, the potential for more cost-effective volatility trading, and the clarity of seeing trade outcomes within the same day. The webinar promises to deliver actionable strategies for integrating these options into trading portfolios, with a strong focus on risk management. It is an opportunity for traders across the spectrum of experience to enhance their understanding of short-term market dynamics and to engage directly with Schwartz during the live Q&A segment.</p>
