<p>Comcast is set to revolutionize digital connectivity in four Minnesota communities—Prior Lake, Savage, Victoria, and Waconia—by deploying high-speed, symmetrical internet services. This ambitious project, representing a multi-million dollar investment, is expected to link more than 30,000 homes and businesses to a suite of advanced internet, mobile, entertainment, and security services for the first time. With this expansion, Comcast's total investment in Minnesota's technological infrastructure over the past three years exceeds $525 million, underscoring the company's commitment to enhancing the state's digital landscape.</p><p>The initiative promises to deliver multi-gigabit internet speeds with 99.9 percent reliability, a critical upgrade that positions local residents and businesses for success in an increasingly digital-dependent world. Through its Xfinity brand, Comcast will offer a comprehensive range of services, including internet, video, mobile, voice, and home security, all designed to meet the growing demands of modern consumers and enterprises.
