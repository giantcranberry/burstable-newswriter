<p>Direxion, a leading ETF provider, has expanded its portfolio with the introduction of four new single stock daily leveraged and inverse exchange-traded funds (ETFs) centered on The Boeing Company and Exxon Mobil Corporation. The new ETFs, namely Direxion Daily BA Bull 2X Shares (BOEU), Direxion Daily BA Bear 1X Shares (BOED), Direxion Daily XOM Bull 2X Shares (XOMX), and Direxion Daily XOM Bear 1X Shares (XOMZ), are tailored for active traders with a high tolerance for risk, seeking focused, short-term trading opportunities.</p><p>These ETFs distinguish themselves from traditional ETFs by tracking the performance of individual stocks instead of broader market indices, thereby removing the layer of diversification that typically mitigates risk. Douglas Yones, CEO of Direxion, emphasized the strategic value of these funds, pointing out that traders can leverage specific catalysts affecting Boeing and Exxon Mobil. For Boeing, such catalysts could include regulatory updates, new airline orders, and production hurdles, whereas Exxon Mobil's performance might be swayed by changes in crude oil prices, demand shifts, and geopolitical events.</p><p>Designed exclusively for short-term trading, these ETFs are not advisable for long-term investment strategies. Direxion urges potential investors to familiarize themselves with the intricate risk profile associated with leveraged and inverse products. The firm provides <a href="https://www.direxion.com/leveraged-etf-education" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">leveraged ETF education resources</a> to help investors grasp the nuanced risks involved.</p><p>Investors should be cognizant of the substantial risks these funds entail. The ETFs are prone to rapid value depreciation, and their performance may not perfectly align with the underlying stock's movements, particularly in volatile market conditions. These products are best suited for sophisticated traders capable of actively overseeing and adjusting their positions.</p>
