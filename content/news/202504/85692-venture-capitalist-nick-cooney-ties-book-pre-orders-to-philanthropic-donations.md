<p>Nick Cooney, a venture capitalist and the founder of Lever VC, is redefining the traditional book launch by integrating philanthropy directly into the pre-order process of his upcoming book, 'What We Don't Do: Inaction in the Face of Suffering and the Drive to Do More.' For every pre-order received, Cooney has committed to donating $100 to high-impact charitable programs focused on alleviating extreme poverty, reducing animal suffering, and protecting the environment. This initiative not only highlights the potential of combining business ventures with social impact but also sets a precedent for how individuals and companies can leverage their resources for the greater good.</p><p>The book delves into the psychological barriers that hinder individuals from taking action against suffering and provides actionable advice on how to maximize one's impact. Published by Regalo Press and distributed by Simon & Schuster, the project has garnered attention for its unique approach to philanthropy. Gretchen Young, the publisher, noted the growing interest in the initiative, fueled by social media campaigns and collaborations with influencers. This strategy not only amplifies the reach of Cooney's message but also significantly increases the potential for charitable contributions.</p><p>Cooney's commitment extends beyond mere donations; he has pledged to continue giving until his personal liquid wealth is exhausted. This bold move underscores the urgency and importance of addressing the issues highlighted in his book. By transforming book pre-orders into a direct mechanism for social change, Cooney challenges the conventional boundaries between commerce and charity, offering a model that others in the business and technology sectors might emulate. The book is set to be released on April 15th, with pre-orders accepted until April 14th, marking a critical window for those looking to contribute to these causes while gaining insights into making a tangible difference in the world.</p><p>This initiative represents a significant shift in how business leaders can engage with social issues, demonstrating that profitability and philanthropy can go hand in hand. For readers and industry leaders alike, Cooney's approach offers both inspiration and a practical framework for integrating social impact into business strategies. The implications of this announcement extend far beyond the book's content, signaling a growing trend towards socially responsible business practices that prioritize global welfare alongside financial success.</p>
