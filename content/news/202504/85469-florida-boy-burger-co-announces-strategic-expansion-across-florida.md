<p>Florida Boy Burger Co., a fast-casual restaurant chain known for its celebration of Florida's culinary culture, is embarking on a significant expansion with the opening of four new locations in 2025. This strategic growth will introduce the brand's unique dining experience to Orlando, Jacksonville, Naples, and North Port, marking a pivotal moment in the company's mission to showcase Florida's rich flavors and traditions.</p><p>Each new restaurant will embody the chain's distinctive aesthetic, featuring reclaimed cypress bars, antique postcards, and taxidermy displays that pay homage to the Everglades and Gulf Coast. A standout feature will be the 500-gallon freshwater tank housing live baby alligators, an initiative developed in partnership with the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission to educate guests on local wildlife.</p><p>The menu at Florida Boy Burger Co. is a testament to the brand's commitment to local sourcing, with 100 percent chuck-and-brisket patties hand-pressed daily. By the fourth quarter of 2025, the company aims to source all its beef from a cooperative of Panhandle cattle ranchers, further reinforcing its dedication to Florida-grown produce and sustainable practices.</p><p>From an economic standpoint, the expansion is a boon for local communities, with each new location representing a $1.6 million investment and creating 35 to 40 jobs. Co-founder Louis Cioffi emphasized the positive ripple effects of these openings, from job creation to the stimulation of local economies.</p><p>Beyond its culinary offerings, Florida Boy Burger Co. is deeply committed to environmental conservation through its 'Burgers for the Bay' initiative. This program supports Everglades restoration and organizes monthly waterway clean-ups, aligning with the company's broader mission to celebrate and preserve Florida's natural beauty.</p><p>While the current focus is on solidifying its presence within Florida, the company is also exploring strategic partnerships that could pave the way for expansion into neighboring Southeastern markets by 2026. With its unique storytelling approach and unwavering commitment to local flavors, Florida Boy Burger Co. is carving out a distinctive niche in the regional restaurant landscape.</p>
