<p>Seanergy Maritime Holdings Corp. (NASDAQ: SHIP) has emerged as a standout performer in the capesize dry bulk shipping sector, leveraging a period of unprecedented market strength to post remarkable financial results and strategic advancements in 2024. The company's success is attributed to a dramatic increase in freight rates, which have soared by 300% from $6,000 to $24,000 per day since mid-November, driven by a favorable supply and demand dynamic.</p><p>The surge in seaborne shipments of key commodities such as iron ore, bauxite, and coal has been a critical factor in Seanergy's performance. Notably, Brazilian iron ore exports have risen by 6% year-over-year, while Guinea's bauxite exports have seen an increase of over 15%. This uptick in demand comes at a time when the capesize fleet growth has been minimal, expanding by just 1.7% in 2024, further tightening the market.</p><p>Financially, Seanergy has reported a 52% increase in net revenue to $167.5 million, with adjusted EBITDA reaching $98.4 million, up from $53.0 million the previous year. The company's net income also saw a significant leap to $43.5 million, a stark contrast to the $2.3 million reported in 2023. These figures underscore Seanergy's robust operational efficiency and its ability to capitalize on current market conditions.</p><p>Strategically, Seanergy has focused on expanding its fleet while ensuring a strong balance sheet. The company has invested $138 million in acquiring four capesize vessels since the second quarter of 2024, increasing its total fleet to 21 units. This expansion aligns with projections that the global capesize bulk carrier market will grow to $112.7 billion by 2032, with a compound annual growth rate of nearly 7%.</p><p>Shareholder value has been a key priority for Seanergy, evidenced by the declaration of a cash dividend of $0.10 per common share for the fourth quarter of 2025 and the repurchase of 532,411 common shares for $4.9 million under its share repurchase program initiated in December 2023.</p><p>Looking ahead, Seanergy is optimistic about the continued strength of the capesize market. With capesize fleet growth expected to slow to 1.4% in 2025 and the anticipated commencement of the Simandou iron ore project in Guinea, alongside rising energy demands in emerging economies, the company is well-positioned to sustain its growth trajectory and navigate the evolving landscape of the bulk shipping industry.</p>
