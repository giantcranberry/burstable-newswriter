<p>The Georgia Society of Certified Public Accountants (GSCPA) has heralded the passage of House Bill 148, a significant legislative update that modernizes CPA licensure and professional practice in Georgia. Effective January 1, 2026, the bill offers two new licensure pathways: a master's degree in accounting or taxation with one year of experience, or a bachelor's degree in accounting with two years of experience, alongside the existing 150-semester-hour requirement.</p><p>This legislative update not only diversifies the routes to becoming a CPA but also simplifies interstate practice privileges, ensuring Georgia businesses have unimpeded access to top-tier accounting talent. GSCPA CEO Boyd Search highlighted the bill's role in addressing the urgent need for skilled professionals by lowering entry barriers and fostering professional mobility.</p><p>Representative John Carson, a CPA and pivotal figure in the bill's advancement, pointed out the legislation's potential to elevate Georgia's economic standing. By making the CPA profession more accessible, the state is set to attract a wider array of talent, enriching the profession's diversity and expertise.</p><p>The unanimous approval of House Bill 148 underscores the collective effort of Georgia's lawmakers, educators, and accounting professionals. With the bill now awaiting Governor Brian Kemp's endorsement, the accounting sector looks forward to a future marked by more inclusive professional development opportunities and a strengthened accounting workforce.</p>
