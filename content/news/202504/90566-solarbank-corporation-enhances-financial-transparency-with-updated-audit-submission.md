<p>SolarBank Corporation has taken a significant step toward enhancing financial transparency by resubmitting its audited consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2024. This update includes the addition of a report from its predecessor independent auditor, MSLL CPA LLP, following a request from the Ontario Securities Commission. The original filing, made on September 30, 2024, now features the predecessor auditor's report immediately after the current auditor ZH CPA, LLC's report, without any changes to the underlying financial data.</p><p>This move underscores SolarBank's dedication to maintaining high standards of financial reporting and adherence to regulatory requirements. As a developer specializing in renewable and clean energy projects across Canada and the United States, SolarBank's commitment to transparency is crucial for stakeholders in the rapidly evolving energy sector. The company's portfolio includes distributed and community solar initiatives, Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) projects, and electric vehicle charging infrastructure, with a development pipeline exceeding one gigawatt and over 100 megawatts of completed projects.</p><p>SolarBank's strategy of selling electricity to a diverse range of off-takers, including utilities, commercial entities, and residential customers, positions it as a key player in the transition toward sustainable energy solutions. The updated financial submission not only reflects the company's compliance with regulatory standards but also its role in fostering trust and stability in the renewable energy market. This development is particularly relevant for business and technology leaders interested in the intersection of regulatory compliance, financial transparency, and sustainable energy development.</p>
