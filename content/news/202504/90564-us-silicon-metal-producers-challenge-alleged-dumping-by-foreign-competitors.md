<p>Ferroglobe USA, Inc. and Mississippi Silicon LLC have taken legal action against silicon metal imports from Angola, Australia, Laos, Norway, and Thailand, accusing these countries of selling their products at artificially low prices. This practice, known as dumping, is claimed to severely harm the U.S. manufacturing sector. The companies have submitted antidumping and countervailing duty petitions to the U.S. Department of Commerce and the International Trade Commission, with allegations of import pricing margins reaching up to 337.84%.</p><p>Silicon metal is a critical material, containing at least 85% elemental silicon, and is essential for the production of aluminum, silicones, and polysilicon. These materials are, in turn, vital for the semiconductor, solar, and electronics industries. Marco Levi, CEO of Ferroglobe PLC, highlighted the detrimental impact of dumped and subsidized imports on the domestic market, stating that such practices have significantly weakened the position of U.S. producers. Echoing this sentiment, Eddie Boardwine, CEO of Mississippi Silicon, stressed the ability of American manufacturers to compete on a global scale, provided the playing field is level.</p><p>The petitions specifically target all forms of silicon metal with a silicon content ranging from 85.00% to 99.99% and an iron content below 4.00%. The U.S. Department of Commerce is slated to begin investigations by May 14, 2025, with the International Trade Commission expected to make a preliminary determination by June 9, 2025. This legal move underscores the broader challenges U.S. manufacturers face in safeguarding domestic industries against unfair international trade practices, particularly in the production of strategic materials like silicon metal.</p>
