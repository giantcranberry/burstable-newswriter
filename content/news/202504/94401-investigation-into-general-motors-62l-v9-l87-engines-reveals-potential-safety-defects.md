<p>Personal injury attorneys at Kantrowitz, Goldhamer & Graifman, P.C. are currently investigating potential defects in General Motors' 6.2L V9 L87 engines, which are installed in several high-profile vehicle models from 2019 to 2024. The models under scrutiny include the Chevrolet Silverado 1500, Chevrolet Tahoe, Chevrolet Suburban, GMC Sierra 1500, GMC Yukon, and Cadillac Escalade. Reports to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) have highlighted instances of sudden power loss due to engine seizures, with mechanical failures stemming from bearing issues that may lead to connecting rods breaching the engine block.</p><p>This investigation sheds light on critical safety implications, as a seized engine could result in unexpected power loss while driving, significantly elevating crash risks for both the vehicle occupants and other road users. Despite the accumulation of consumer complaints and an ongoing NHTSA investigation, General Motors has yet to issue a formal recall for the affected vehicles. This situation has prompted Kantrowitz, Goldhamer & Graifman, P.C. to evaluate the feasibility of a class action lawsuit on behalf of vehicle owners experiencing these engine problems, potentially offering compensation for repair costs, diminished vehicle value, and other related damages.</p><p>With a history of handling consumer protection and class action litigation since 1975, Kantrowitz, Goldhamer & Graifman, P.C. has assembled a specialized team to review cases related to these engine failures. Their expertise in consumer protection matters across New York and New Jersey equips them to conduct a comprehensive investigation into these potential mechanical defects, underscoring the importance of addressing these safety concerns promptly to prevent further risks on the road.</p>
