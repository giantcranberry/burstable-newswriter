<p>G Mining Ventures Corp. has recently released a detailed feasibility study for its Oko West Gold Project in Guyana, showcasing the project's strong economic viability and potential for substantial gold production. The study forecasts a total gold output of 4.3 million ounces over a 12.3-year lifespan, with an average annual production of 350,000 ounces. This positions the Oko West Project as a significant contributor to the gold mining sector, with an all-in sustaining cost of $1,123 per ounce, making it a competitive venture in the current market.</p><p>Financial projections for the project are notably robust, with an after-tax net present value of $2.2 billion and a 27% after-tax internal rate of return, based on a gold price assumption of $2,500 per ounce. These figures underscore the project's potential to deliver considerable returns to investors, reinforcing Guyana's reputation as a mining-friendly jurisdiction. The strategic planning phase is progressing, with final environmental permits expected by the second quarter of 2025, paving the way for a construction decision in the latter half of the same year.</p><p>The Oko West Gold Project, situated in Region 7 of Guyana, represents a significant investment in the country's mining sector. G Mining Ventures Corp.'s commitment to developing sustainable and economically viable precious metal projects is evident in the comprehensive feasibility study. The project not only promises to boost the local economy but also aligns with global efforts towards responsible mining practices.
