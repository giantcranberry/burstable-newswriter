<p>UGI Utilities, Inc. has announced a comprehensive infrastructure upgrade in Emmaus, with gas main replacement work slated to start on April 28, 2025. This project, focusing on Chestnut Street between North 9th Street and Sixth Street, is expected to wrap up by early September, marking a significant step forward in the company's efforts to ensure the safety and reliability of natural gas services for its customers.</p><p>The construction, which will run from Monday to Friday, 7 am to 5 pm, is anticipated to bring about temporary inconveniences such as road closures, detours, and traffic delays. Additionally, parking restrictions will be enforced on the affected streets, and residents may experience brief interruptions in natural gas service as UGI representatives access properties to inspect and relight equipment.</p><p>An advantageous aspect of this upgrade is the opportunity it presents for homes and businesses along the project route to switch to natural gas. This initiative not only aims to modernize the infrastructure but also to make natural gas more accessible to the local community, potentially leading to energy cost savings and environmental benefits.</p><p>While the target completion date is early September, UGI cautions that the project's timeline could be influenced by unforeseen factors such as adverse weather conditions. This project underscores UGI Utilities' commitment to investing in infrastructure improvements to serve over 760,000 customers with safe and reliable utility services.</p>
