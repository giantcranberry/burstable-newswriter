<p>Meridianbet, a global leader in sports betting and iGaming, has announced its corporate social responsibility (CSR) milestones for 2024, demonstrating a comprehensive approach to sustainability and social impact. The company's efforts span 25 markets across Europe, Latin America, and Africa, with nearly 300 CSR actions focused on healthcare, education, sports development, and support for local institutions. A notable highlight is its pioneering partnership with Crvena zvezda, marking the first emblem logo integration between a gaming brand and a top Euroleague basketball club.</p><p>Technologically, Meridianbet stands out as part of the '5% Tech Club', a select group of operators that develop and maintain their entire technology stack in-house. This technological edge supports its social impact strategies, including the Meridianbet Donate Button and a global book donation initiative aimed at enriching underfunded libraries. The company's innovative 'Scan. Help.' campaign leverages QR codes to fund critical medical equipment for maternity hospitals, alongside strategic support for women's football and participation in flood relief efforts in Brazil.</p><p>Governance and diversity are key pillars of Meridianbet's operations, with women occupying over 60% of managerial positions. The company also plays a strategic role in shaping European gaming industry policies through its involvement with the European Organization for Gaming Law, highlighting its dedication to responsible industry growth. CEO Zoran Milosevic underscores ESG as a core operational strategy, not just a corporate slogan, with tangible outcomes across various sectors. The upcoming 2024 ESG Report will further detail Meridianbet's global impact and sustainable business practices.</p>
