<p>The Chamber of Commerce and Industry (CCI) France Malaysia has recently relocated and expanded its business center in Wisma Mont Kiara, marking a significant milestone in its mission to support French businesses in Malaysia. This expansion not only enhances the Chamber's physical presence but also its capacity to serve the business community with a large multipurpose function room, capable of hosting up to 40 participants for conferences and training sessions.</p><p>With the addition of the new facility, CCI France Malaysia's national network now boasts two business centers in Kuala Lumpur, alongside satellite offices in Johor Bahru, Penang, and Kota Kinabalu. The center is equipped with 16 workstations and offices, adding to the organization's extensive infrastructure that includes 30 private offices, 22 workstations, and six meeting rooms. This development is a testament to the Chamber's dedication to providing comprehensive support and resources to French and Malaysian businesses alike.</p><p>A standout feature of the expanded center is its capability to host <a href='https://www.mfcci.com/business-center.html' rel='nofollow' target='_blank'>HRDC-certified training programs</a>, covering essential business areas such as human resources, management, artificial intelligence, sales, and sustainability. These programs highlight the Chamber's focus on talent development and upskilling within the business community, ensuring that members are equipped with the knowledge and skills needed to thrive in today's competitive landscape.</p><p>The inauguration of the new center was a notable event, attended by key figures such as Datuk Sikh Shamsul Ibrahim Sikh Abdul Majid, CEO of the Malaysian Investment Development Authority (MIDA), H.E. Axel Cruau, Ambassador of France to Malaysia, and Richard Fostier, President of CCI France Malaysia. Their presence underscored the strong collaborative ties between the French and Malaysian business sectors and the shared commitment to fostering economic growth and innovation.</p><p>Beyond its physical expansion, CCI France Malaysia continues to offer a wide range of business support services, including assistance with company setup, visa applications, payroll and accounting services, certified translations, and legal and administrative support for regulatory compliance. With nearly 600 French companies established in Malaysia and over 300 organizational members, the Chamber plays a pivotal role in facilitating trade and investment between France and Malaysia. The expansion of the business center is a clear indication of CCI France Malaysia's ongoing efforts to strengthen bilateral business ties and support entrepreneurial development in the Asia-Pacific region.</p>
