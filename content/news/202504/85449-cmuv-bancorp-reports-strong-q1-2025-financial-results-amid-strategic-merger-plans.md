These figures underscore the institution's solid financial footing and operational efficiency.</p><p>The bank's capital strength is evident from its Community Bank Leverage Capital ratio of 10.82%, well above the regulatory requirements for a well-capitalized status.

The return on average assets (ROAA) and return on average equity (ROAE) were reported at 0.52% and 4.52%, respectively, indicating healthy profitability metrics.</p><p>A pivotal aspect of this quarter's announcement is the proposed transaction with Frontwave Credit Union, initially revealed on January 22, 2025. This strategic merger has impacted the quarter's earnings due to related transaction expenses, signaling a significant shift in the bank's trajectory. The proposed merger and subsequent dissolution of CMUV Bancorp will be a key focus at the Special Shareholder Meeting scheduled for July 15, 2025, in Brawley, California.</p><p>This development is crucial for shareholders and the broader financial industry, as it represents a strategic consolidation that could enhance competitive positioning and service offerings. Shareholders are advised to review the forthcoming proxy materials by mid-June for detailed insights into the transaction and voting proposals.</p><p>The implications of CMUV Bancorp's Q1 performance and the proposed merger extend beyond immediate financial metrics, offering a glimpse into the evolving landscape of community banking and credit union collaborations.
