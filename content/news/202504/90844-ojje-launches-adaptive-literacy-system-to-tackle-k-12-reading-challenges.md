<p>Education technology company Ojje has introduced an adaptive literacy system designed to revolutionize reading instruction for K-12 students. This platform addresses the critical issue of reading proficiency, with national data from the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) showing that 66% of 4th graders and 69% of 8th graders are not proficient in reading. The system offers a scalable, personalized learning experience to meet the diverse needs of students, whose reading abilities can vary by as much as 9-11.6 grade levels within a single classroom.</p><p>The platform features a library of short-form stories available in 15 reading levels in both English and Spanish, complete with illustrations, read-aloud support, and synchronized word highlighting. It is based on the Science of Reading methodology and includes decodable texts aligned with the University of Florida Literacy Institute (UFLI), focusing on early literacy development. Stories are designed to be completed in 5-15 minutes, encouraging daily reading habits that enhance stamina and comprehension.</p><p>For educators, Ojje provides tools to save time and gain insights into student progress, along with the unique Story Maker feature. This allows teachers to quickly create curriculum-based content across all reading levels, add comprehension questions, and produce leveled audiobooks in about 15 minutes. The platform also supports English Language Learners, who make up 10.4% of public school students, with bilingual content to foster inclusive learning environments.</p><p>Under the leadership of CEO Adrian Chernoff, whose experience includes innovations at NASA and Disney, Ojje aims to eliminate educational barriers and empower teachers. This initiative marks a pivotal move towards leveraging technology for personalized literacy education, offering a solution to one of the most significant challenges in education today.</p>
