<p>SolarBank Corporation, a leader in renewable and clean energy project development, has recently amended its 2024 annual financial statements to include the report of its predecessor independent auditor, MSLL CPA LLP. This adjustment was made in response to a request from the Ontario Securities Commission during a routine prospectus review, underscoring the stringent regulatory environment surrounding financial disclosures in the renewable energy sector.</p><p>The restatement, which was originally filed on September 30, 2024, incorporates the predecessor auditor's report alongside the current auditor ZH CPA, LLC's report. SolarBank has clarified that the financial statements themselves remain unchanged, emphasizing the procedural nature of this amendment. This move reflects the company's commitment to maintaining high standards of transparency and accountability, which are paramount in fostering investor trust and confidence.</p><p>Specializing in distributed and community solar initiatives, SolarBank has carved a niche for itself in the North American renewable energy market. With a development pipeline surpassing one gigawatt and existing projects totaling over 100 megawatts, the company is at the forefront of the transition towards sustainable energy solutions. Its diverse portfolio, encompassing solar, Battery Energy Storage System (BESS), and electric vehicle charging projects, caters to a wide range of off-takers, including utilities, commercial entities, and residential customers.</p><p>The financial restatement by SolarBank serves as a reminder of the critical importance of regulatory compliance and precise financial reporting in the renewable energy industry. As the sector continues to grow, the accuracy and completeness of financial disclosures will play a pivotal role in attracting investment and ensuring the long-term viability of clean energy projects. This development not only highlights SolarBank's adherence to regulatory standards but also reinforces the broader industry's commitment to transparency and sustainability.</p>
