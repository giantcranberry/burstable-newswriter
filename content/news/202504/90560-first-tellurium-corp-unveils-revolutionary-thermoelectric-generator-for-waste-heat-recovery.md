<p>First Tellurium Corp., via its majority-owned subsidiary PyroDelta Energy Inc., is set to introduce a novel thermoelectric generator aimed at revolutionizing waste heat recovery in combustion engines. This innovation, the result of eight years of development, could offer fuel savings of at least 6% by converting waste heat into usable electrical energy, thereby eliminating the need for traditional components such as alternators and radiators.</p><p>The technology utilizes tellurium-based materials to efficiently capture and convert heat, with a design that facilitates easy installation in both new and existing vehicles. This versatility positions the generator as a potential game-changer for enhancing energy efficiency not only in transportation but also in industrial settings.</p><p>CEO Tyrone Docherty emphasized the scalability of the technology, pointing to its applicability in sectors like artificial intelligence and cryptocurrency mining. A video presentation scheduled for April 30 will showcase the generator's capabilities, offering stakeholders and potential investors a detailed look at its performance.</p><p>Alongside the technological showcase, Docherty announced a shareholder luncheon in mid-May and the issuance of 1.5 million stock options at $0.15 per share, reflecting the company's optimism about the future of its technological advancements.</p>
