<p>Wytec International is set to revolutionize school safety with the launch of its first pilot program for an integrated AI gunshot detection solution across Texas school districts. This initiative, part of a broader effort to enhance public safety, utilizes the Federal Communications Commission's Citizens Broadband Radio Service (CBRS) to establish secure, private wireless networks capable of detecting various gunshot threats.</p><p>The program stems from a multi-state government award via the TXShare Cooperative Purchasing Program, enabling Wytec to deploy its cutting-edge solutions in over 170 U.S. cities, 50 counties, and various special districts, including educational institutions, healthcare facilities, and public safety organizations. This move underscores the growing emphasis on leveraging technology to safeguard communities.</p><p>Collaborating with Nextivity Inc. and Lemko Corporation, Wytec has developed an embedded AI and machine learning software solution for threat detection. This technology combines smart sensors with advanced wireless connectivity, backed by over 75 global patents and patent-pending technologies. Nextivity's contribution includes in-building cellular solutions, while Lemko Corporation provides a secure wireless backbone through its private LTE network capabilities, highlighting the collaborative effort to enhance public safety.</p><p>Wytec's selection of one or more Texas Independent School Districts from the TXShare members for the initial pilot reflects a strategic phased approach. This initiative not only demonstrates the potential of advanced public safety technologies but also addresses the urgent need for innovative solutions to combat gun violence in educational settings. The program represents a significant step forward in the integration of technology and public safety, offering a proactive measure to protect students and staff in schools across Texas.</p>
