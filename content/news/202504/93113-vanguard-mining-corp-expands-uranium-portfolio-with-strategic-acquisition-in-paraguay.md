<p>Vanguard Mining Corp. has announced a strategic move to acquire four uranium concessions in Paraguay's Parana Basin, covering approximately 90,000 hectares. This acquisition, known as the Yuty Prometeo project, includes three San Jose and one Yuty Uno concessions, situated near Uranium Energy Corp.'s Yuty deposit, a site with a multi-million-pound uranium resource. The deal underscores Vanguard's commitment to expanding its uranium exploration footprint in a region with significant potential.</p><p>Under the terms of the agreement, Vanguard will obtain an 85% interest in Paraguay Uranium. The transaction involves a $20,000 payment upon signing, the issuance of 8,000,000 common shares to Paraguay Uranium shareholders, and an additional $20,000 payment upon the receipt of a prospecting permit. This acquisition is poised to enhance Vanguard's position in the uranium sector, leveraging the historical exploration data and promising assay results from the Uno Concessions, where uranium concentrations have ranged from 0.05% to 0.10% U₃O₈.</p><p>The geological alignment of the Prometeo block with Uranium Energy Corp.'s adjacent Transandes block, coupled with the significant uranium anomalies identified through radiometric surveys on the San Jose Concession, presents a compelling exploration opportunity. The proximity to UEC's Yuty ISR Project, which boasts an established resource estimate, further bolsters the strategic value of this acquisition for Vanguard.</p><p>Paraguay's favorable mining jurisdiction, characterized by political stability, low sovereign risk, and an investor-friendly regulatory framework, adds another layer of appeal to this venture. The country's emerging focus on mineral exploration, particularly in uranium and strategic minerals, positions it as an attractive destination for mining investments. Vanguard Mining's CEO, David Greenway, highlighted the transformative nature of this acquisition, emphasizing its role in positioning the company within one of South America's most promising uranium regions.</p><p>This strategic acquisition not only marks a pivotal step in Vanguard Mining Corp.'s uranium exploration strategy but also signals the growing importance of Paraguay in the global uranium market. For industry leaders and investors, this development underscores the potential for significant discoveries and the evolving dynamics of uranium exploration in South America.</p>
