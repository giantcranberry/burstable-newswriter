<p>Pratesi, the esteemed Italian luxury linens brand, has inaugurated its newest retail outlet at 130 Newbury Street in Boston, introducing its century-long tradition of exquisite craftsmanship and innovative design to the city's elite shopping district. This opening is a pivotal part of Pratesi's strategic growth, following recent expansions in Palm Beach, concessions at Bloomingdale's in New York City and South Coast Plaza, and the launch of a European flagship in Paris.</p><p>The Boston store is designed to be more than a mere retail space; it is an embodiment of Pratesi's dedication to artistry and superior quality. With features like a custom-designed milk oak geometric parquet floor with travertine inlay, oiled hand-rubbed teak, and sophisticated leather accents, the store offers an immersive experience that mirrors the brand's rich Italian heritage.</p><p>A highlight of the new location is the introduction of Pratesi's bespoke program, which facilitates direct collaboration between the brand's Italian atelier and interior designers or clients. This initiative allows for the creation of custom linens tailored for a variety of luxury environments, including residential spaces, private yachts, and aviation interiors, showcasing the brand's adaptability and commitment to personalized luxury.</p><p>Pratesi's linens are renowned for their heirloom quality, crafted in Italy's finest mills and hand-cut by skilled artisans. The brand's unwavering focus on quality ensures that each piece becomes softer and more luxurious over time, embodying a legacy of luxury that has been refined over generations.</p><p>Michelle Klein, CEO of Pratesi, highlighted the importance of the Boston store, describing it as a venue that offers an unmatched shopping experience, encapsulating the essence of Pratesi's design philosophy. Beyond serving as a retail space, the store is envisioned as a hub for the interior design community to engage with the brand's iconic collections.</p><p>Founded in 1906 with a romantic gesture—Remigio Pratesi's commission of an embroidered linen set for his future bride—the brand has steadfastly upheld its commitment to exceptional craftsmanship. Today, Pratesi continues to produce its collections exclusively in Italy, utilizing the finest Egyptian cotton, and stands as a testament to the perfect marriage of tradition and innovation in the luxury linens market.</p>
