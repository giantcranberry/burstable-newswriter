Open to all U.S. craft distillers using corn, the event promises a diverse showcase of spirits, from traditional bourbon to innovative whiskey expressions.</p><p>Representing more than 75% of U.S. craft distillers, participating state corn marketing associations from Colorado, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, and several other states ensure a wide-ranging and competitive field.
