<p>Giant Mining Corporation has announced the integration of an artificial intelligence-guided approach to its 2025 drilling program at the Majuba Hill Porphyry Copper-Silver-Gold Deposit in Pershing County, Nevada. This innovative strategy aims to more accurately target potential mineral resources, following the successful completion of Hole MHB-32, which reached a depth of 889.5 feet. A fifth drill hole, designed by ExploreTech's proprietary AI program, has been added to the program, targeting a high-potential southern resistivity anomaly identified through advanced computational modeling.</p><p>CEO David Greenway highlighted the strategic significance of this expanded drilling initiative, noting its potential in light of increasing copper prices and the growing demand for domestic U.S. copper. The program's objectives include expanding known copper mineralization zones and progressing towards a new Mineral Resource Estimate. ExploreTech's AI methodology, which combines surface geology and drilling results with intensive geophysical data remodeling, plays a pivotal role in this endeavor. The technology generates thousands of potential solutions, focusing on the most promising geological and geophysical data intersections to optimize drilling trajectories.</p><p>Big Sky Exploration, LLC was responsible for drilling Hole MHB-32, with core samples set to be transported to Giant Mining's Elko, Nevada warehouse for processing and analysis by ALS Group USA, Corp. These samples will undergo comprehensive assays for copper, silver, gold, and trace elements. The 2025 Core Program builds on the success of the 2024 drill holes MHB-30 and MHB-31, which uncovered high-grade copper mineralization. The current program aims to extend these high-grade copper zones beneath historic underground workings.</p><p>The Majuba Hill project, located in Nevada—a top-ranked mining jurisdiction—covers 9,684 acres and has already seen 83,930 feet of drilling. Initial surveys and drilling results suggest the potential for a significant copper-silver-gold mineralized body, with opportunities for expansion. Giant Mining is committed to advancing copper, silver, and gold projects to support global green energy infrastructure and meet critical metal demands, positioning the Majuba Hill project as a potential key contributor to domestic mineral resources.</p>
