<p>Pampa Metals Corp. has made a significant stride in mineral exploration with the discovery of a new copper-gold porphyry system at its Piuquenes East project in San Juan, Argentina. The initial drill hole, PIU-06, revealed a mineralized interval of 98 meters with grades of 0.49% copper and 0.16 grams per tonne gold, indicating the presence of a potentially substantial mineral system. This discovery is particularly noteworthy as it represents a previously unexplored mineral zone adjacent to Aldebaran Resources' Altar porphyry system, suggesting the possibility of further discoveries in the area.</p><p>The geological findings from the Piuquenes East project highlight a complex, multi-phase porphyry system, characterized by various alteration stages and mineralization styles. Features such as quartz stockwork veining and the presence of chalcopyrite and chalcocite mineralization are indicative of world-class porphyry deposits. The system's progressive alteration from potassic to chlorite-sericite and advanced argillic phases further underscores its geological significance.</p><p>Subsequent drilling, including hole PIU-07, has corroborated the initial findings, encountering similar breccia formations and localized high-sulfidation mineralization. These results not only confirm the geological complexity of the area but also suggest the potential for additional mineral discoveries within the broader Piuquenes project area. The strategic location of the discovery within the San Juan Miocene porphyry belt, home to several major copper mining operations, enhances its potential value and impact on the mining industry.</p><p>While the current drill results show modest mineralization, the multi-phase nature of the system points to promising prospects for future exploration. Pampa Metals Corp. plans to continue its exploration efforts through systematic geological mapping, geophysical surveys, and targeted drilling. This discovery could have far-reaching implications for the mining industry, potentially contributing to the global supply of copper and gold, and reinforcing Argentina's position as a key player in the mineral resources sector.</p>
