<p>The consumer packaged goods (CPG) community in Houston is set to highlight its resilience and innovative spirit through an upcoming networking event. The CPG Houston Market Happy Hour, scheduled for Wednesday, April 23, at Lustre Pearl East Downtown, will serve as a free, public platform for brands within the food, wellness, and lifestyle sectors to showcase their products and network with industry stakeholders.</p><p>Organized by volunteers from Wingman Kitchens and Culture Pilot, this event is part of a larger effort to support CPG brands facing economic difficulties. It aims to facilitate direct engagement between local producers and retail buyers, category managers, distributors, and investors, thereby fostering potential collaborations and meaningful connections.</p><p>From 5 to 8 PM, attendees will have the opportunity to discover emerging brands, share products, and enhance local awareness. The organizers stress that the event's focus is on genuine community building and mutual support, rather than on polished presentations.</p><p>This initiative is supported by <a href='https://TexasCPG.org' rel='nofollow' target='_blank'>TexasCPG.org</a>, a grassroots organization that is establishing city-specific chapters to connect founders, retailers, and resources throughout Texas. By offering a platform for interaction and visibility, the event demonstrates the potential for local businesses to flourish despite broader economic challenges.</p><p>The CPG Houston Market Happy Hour not only underscores the entrepreneurial resilience of the region but also celebrates the innovative spirit of local consumer product creators committed to growth and community development.</p>
