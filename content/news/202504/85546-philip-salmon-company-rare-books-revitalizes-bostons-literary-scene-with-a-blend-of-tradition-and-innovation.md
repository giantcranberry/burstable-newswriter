<p>The rare book scene in Boston has been enriched with the arrival of Philip Salmon & Company Rare Books, a new establishment that promises to carry forward the legacy of its predecessor while introducing fresh perspectives to the world of rare book collecting. Located at 607 Boylston Street, the shop occupies the space once home to the esteemed Bromer Booksellers, signaling a new chapter in Boston's literary history.</p><p>Phil Salmon, co-owner of the new venture, describes it as a 'legacy venture,' with a team that includes former Bromer employees. This team is dedicated to upholding the shop's prestigious reputation while also pioneering new ways to engage with rare book collecting. Their first catalog, titled 'The Interaction of Paper,' exemplifies this approach by delving into the art of paper engineering across various epochs, showcasing items from children's pop-up books to intricate artist's books, with prices ranging from $50 to several thousand dollars.</p><p>In an era where most rare book dealers operate solely online, Philip Salmon & Company stands out by offering a physical space where collectors and enthusiasts can personally interact with the books. Salmon highlights the unique value of this hands-on experience, which allows potential buyers to fully appreciate the craftsmanship and history of each piece before making a purchase.</p><p>The shop's inventory is not limited to paper engineering; it also includes literary first editions, manuscripts, letters, fine printing, and works by notable figures such as Edward Gorey, as well as miniature books. Looking ahead, Salmon has expressed ambitions to broaden the shop's focus to include materials related to social justice issues, further diversifying its offerings and appeal.</p><p>Open Monday through Friday, with weekend appointments available, Philip Salmon & Company Rare Books represents a bold step towards preserving the tactile and communal aspects of rare book collecting in an increasingly digital world. Its opening is a testament to the enduring allure of physical books and the importance of spaces that celebrate their history and artistry.</p>
