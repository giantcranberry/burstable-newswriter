<p>ProElite Dental Supply is making waves in the dental equipment distribution sector with its national expansion and strategic alliances with leading global technology manufacturers. This move is set to transform how dental practices access and afford cutting-edge technologies, marking a significant shift in the industry's supply chain dynamics.</p><p>At the heart of ProElite's strategy is a commitment to bypass traditional high markups, offering a curated selection of advanced dental equipment directly to practices. Among the standout products in their catalog are the HyperLight Portable X-Ray System, Helios 500 3D Digital Scanner, Jinme High-Speed Handpieces, and the Eighteeth CBCT Unit. These technologies represent the forefront of dental innovation, enabling practitioners to deliver superior patient care.</p><p>Founded by DJ Moody, ProElite Dental Supply is built on a foundation of trust, customer priority, and goodwill.
