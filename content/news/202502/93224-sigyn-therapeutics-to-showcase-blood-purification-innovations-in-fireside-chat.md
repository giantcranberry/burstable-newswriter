<p>Sigyn Therapeutics is poised to share its advancements in blood purification technologies during an exclusive Fireside Chat with Zacks Senior Healthcare Analyst John Vandermosten. This event, organized by Force Family Office, will delve into the potential of these therapies to revolutionize the treatment of life-threatening infectious diseases and improve cancer treatment outcomes. Jim Joyce, CEO of Sigyn Therapeutics, will offer a closer look at the company's pioneering technologies that seek to broaden the horizon of medical treatments beyond conventional pharmaceutical solutions.</p><p>At the heart of Sigyn Therapeutics' innovation is Sigyn Therapy, a lead product that has shown promise in removing viral pathogens, bacterial toxins, and pro-inflammatory cytokines from human blood plasma. This breakthrough opens new avenues for addressing complex medical challenges, including viral infections, antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections, endotoxemia, and sepsis. The company is also advancing other platforms like ImmunePrep, ChemoPrep, and ChemoPure, aimed at optimizing immunotherapeutic antibody delivery, refining chemotherapeutic agent administration, and potentially mitigating chemotherapy toxicity.</p><p>One of the clinical strategies involves integrating Sigyn Therapy with routine dialysis treatments to target endotoxemia and concurrent inflammation in end-stage renal disease patients. This approach not only has the potential to enhance patient survival rates but also to make a substantial impact within the dialysis sector. The upcoming Fireside Chat serves as a pivotal platform for healthcare professionals, investors, and researchers to explore the transformative potential of blood purification technologies in reshaping medical treatment paradigms.</p>
