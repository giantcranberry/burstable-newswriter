This collaboration equips financial institutions with the tools to securely manage LSK tokens alongside major cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, leveraging Fireblocks' advanced Multi-Party Computation (MPC) technology. The partnership is a direct response to the growing institutional demand for crypto, underscored by Fireblocks' report of $60 billion in DeFi transactions last year.</p><p>Dominic Schwenter, Lisk's Chief Operating Officer, highlighted the strategic nature of this partnership, pointing to the increasing institutional search for reliable platforms to navigate the digital asset space.
