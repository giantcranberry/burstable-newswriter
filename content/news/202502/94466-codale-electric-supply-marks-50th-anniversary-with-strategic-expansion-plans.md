<p>Codale Electric Supply, a regional leader in electrical distribution, is poised to celebrate its 50th anniversary in 2025 with a series of ambitious growth initiatives. Founded in 1975 by Dale and Jay R. Holt with a modest team of five, the company has grown exponentially, now boasting over 530 associates and 18 branches across Utah, Wyoming, Nevada, and Idaho.</p><p>The company's expansion strategy includes the construction of a 150,000-square-foot Customer Delivery Center (CDC) in Las Vegas, which will feature an automated warehouse to significantly improve order fulfillment efficiency. Further plans involve opening a Pro Logistics Center in Las Vegas, launching a Will Call branch in Saratoga Springs, Utah, relocating its Midvale branch to Draper, and establishing a new branch in Idaho Falls.</p><p>President Todd Saunders emphasized Codale's dedication to innovation and growth, attributing the company's success to its hardworking associates, loyal customer base, and the support from its parent company, Sonepar. From its humble beginnings in a 5,000-square-foot facility, Codale has consistently expanded its operations and capabilities, including becoming an Allen-Bradley distributor in 1984 and adopting advanced warehouse automation systems in 2021.</p><p>The last ten years have been particularly transformative for Codale, marked by strategic acquisitions and the introduction of specialized segments such as solar energy in 2017. As part of the global Sonepar network, Codale is well-positioned to continue leading innovation in electrical distribution across the Intermountain West region.</p>
