<p>Eight distinguished Peruvian fashion brands are poised to showcase the nation's exceptional textile capabilities at Coterie New York, a premier global fashion trade event. From February 18 to 20, brands such as Balkanica, Carla Testino, and Kuna will present collections that blend traditional craftsmanship with contemporary design, highlighting Peru's unique position in the fashion industry.</p><p>Peru's textile sector is renowned for its premium raw materials, including alpaca fiber and Pima cotton, known for their superior quality. Alpaca fiber offers luxurious texture and thermoregulating properties, while Pima cotton is celebrated for its comfort and durability. These materials underscore Peru's competitive edge in producing high-quality, sustainable fashion.</p><p>The U.S.-Peru Free Trade Agreement further enhances Peru's appeal by allowing duty-free entry of garments into the U.S. market, reducing production costs without compromising quality. This economic advantage, combined with a commitment to sustainability through responsible sourcing and ethical production practices, positions Peru as a leader in environmentally conscious fashion manufacturing.</p><p>Peru's textile industry operates on a full-package manufacturing model, covering every step from fabric sourcing to final garment production. This integrated approach ensures efficiency, consistency, and superior quality, catering to both emerging designers and established international brands. Through strategic initiatives by PROMPERÃš, Peru is cementing its reputation as an innovative and reliable partner in the global fashion market.</p><p>The participation of Peruvian brands at Coterie New York not only showcases the country's rich textile heritage and modern design capabilities but also signals its growing influence and competitiveness in the international fashion industry. This event represents a significant opportunity for Peruvian brands to connect with global buyers and reinforce the country's status as a source of high-quality, sustainable fashion.</p>
