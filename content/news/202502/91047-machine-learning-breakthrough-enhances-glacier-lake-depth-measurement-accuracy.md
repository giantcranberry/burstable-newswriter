<p>Scientists from Sun Yat-sen University have developed a machine learning approach that markedly enhances the accuracy of measuring supraglacial lake depths, a pivotal advancement in climate change research. Published in the Journal of Remote Sensing, their study introduces a method combining XGBoost and LightGBM algorithms with satellite imagery from ICESat-2, Landsat-8, and Sentinel-2, resulting in the enhanced Automated Lake Depth (ALD) algorithm.</p><p>This innovative technique was tested on seven supraglacial lakes in Greenland, where XGBoost applied to Sentinel-2 L1C imagery achieved a root mean square error of merely 0.54 meters, a significant improvement over traditional methods. The precision of this approach is crucial for understanding ice sheet mass balance and the dynamics of melting rates, as supraglacial lakes are key indicators of climate change impacts.</p><p>Dr. Qi Liang, the lead researcher, highlighted the scalability of this machine learning-based method for large-area monitoring, opening new avenues for assessing climate change effects in polar and glaciated regions. The study also uncovered that top-of-atmosphere reflectance data outperforms atmospherically corrected data in lake bathymetry mapping, pointing to potential limitations in existing correction techniques.</p><p>Supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China among others, this research underscores the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration in tackling climate change. The development represents a leap forward in remote sensing technology, equipping scientists with more accurate tools to monitor glacier systems amidst rapid environmental changes.</p>
