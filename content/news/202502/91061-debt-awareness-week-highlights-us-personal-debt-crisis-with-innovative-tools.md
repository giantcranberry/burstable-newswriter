<p>Recent findings underscore a concerning financial reality for many Americans, with the average worker earning $62,000 annually but facing $105,056 in total consumer debt. Credit card debt alone averages $8,674 per cardholder, highlighting a widespread challenge. In response, Debt.com has launched Debt Awareness Week from February 17-23, aiming to educate consumers on managing their debt through innovative tools and resources.</p><p>Central to this initiative is the Debt-Free Day Calculator, a tool designed to help individuals grasp the magnitude of their debt by illustrating the time required to become debt-free. For the average American, this means dedicating 20 months of their entire income to debt repayment, a stark revelation that assumes no living expenses. Howard Dvorkin, CPA and chairman of Debt.com, points out the normalization of debt in society, stating, "When everyone is in debt, no one feels like it's a problem. Debt becomes a way of life." The calculator seeks to change this perception by making the abstract concept of debt more concrete.</p><p>Don Silvestri, President of Debt.com, highlights the calculator's potential to shift perspectives: "Once you realize that you're working most of the year just to pay down debt, it really starts to sink in." By translating total debt into days of work, the tool offers a vivid illustration of personal financial struggles, encouraging individuals to seek solutions.</p><p>Debt Awareness Week also promotes access to free resources for debt management, credit counseling, and budgeting. Through these efforts, Debt.com aims to empower Americans to reduce their debt burden and move closer to achieving financial freedom. This initiative not only sheds light on the personal debt crisis but also provides actionable steps for individuals to regain control of their financial futures.</p>
