<p>Aeva Technologies has made a significant leap in autonomous vehicle technology with the introduction of its Atlas Ultra LiDAR sensor. This innovative sensor boasts up to three times the resolution of its predecessor, the Atlas, and features a configurable field of view that extends to 150 degrees across the horizon. With a maximum detection range of 500 meters, the Atlas Ultra is poised to enhance the safety and efficiency of autonomous driving systems dramatically.</p><p>The Atlas Ultra's design is another breakthrough, with a 35% slimmer profile that allows for seamless integration behind vehicle windshields or rooflines. This design innovation addresses a critical challenge in autonomous vehicle development by ensuring that advanced sensing technology does not compromise vehicle aesthetics. At CES, Aeva, in collaboration with Wideye, showcased the industry's first functional Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) in-cabin 4D LiDAR solution, demonstrating the sensor's capability to provide enhanced long-range sensing with minimal aerodynamic impact.</p><p>Among its advanced features, the Atlas Ultra is immune to direct sunlight and interference from other LiDAR sensors. It can detect small objects on the roadway with centimeter accuracy, differentiate between lane markers and road hazards, and track dynamic objects at distances far beyond those achievable with conventional 3D time-of-flight LiDAR sensors. These capabilities represent a significant advancement in the quest for safer autonomous vehicles.</p><p>Aeva's partnership with Torc Robotics, a subsidiary of Daimler Truck AG, further underscores the sensor's potential. Together, they are developing advanced safety architectures for autonomous truck technology, leveraging 4D LiDAR sensing data to enable more intelligent decision-making in autonomous vehicles. This collaboration utilizes a Freightliner Cascadia vehicle platform, highlighting the practical applications of Aeva's technology in the commercial vehicle sector.</p><p>The company's custom silicon, including the Aeva CoreVision LiDAR-on-Chip module and X1 System-on-Chip processor, plays a crucial role in the sensor's advanced capabilities. These components facilitate sophisticated AI-powered object detection and classification, enabling the identification of vulnerable road users such as pedestrians and cyclists, as well as various vehicle types. With the Atlas Ultra sensor and its strategic partnerships, Aeva Technologies is leading the charge in making autonomous vehicles safer, more efficient, and seamlessly integrated into our transportation ecosystem.</p>
