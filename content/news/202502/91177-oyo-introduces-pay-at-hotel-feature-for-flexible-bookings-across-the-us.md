This innovation is available at over 400 properties across 35 states, aiming to simplify the booking process with a three-click reservation system that requires no upfront financial commitment.</p><p>The feature, initially piloted in Houston, showed notable success, including increased customer satisfaction and lower cancellation rates. Nikhil Heda, OYO US's Head of Business Development, highlighted the feature's alignment with the needs of business professionals and spontaneous travelers, positioning OYO uniquely in the competitive hospitality sector.</p><p>Early results from the pilot indicate strong adoption among last-minute bookers and enhanced customer satisfaction. The Pay at Hotel option is accessible via OYO's mobile app and website, underscoring the company's commitment to leveraging technology for improved hospitality services.</p><p>This development follows OYO's recent acquisition of G6 Hospitality, known for the Motel 6 and Studio 6 brands.
