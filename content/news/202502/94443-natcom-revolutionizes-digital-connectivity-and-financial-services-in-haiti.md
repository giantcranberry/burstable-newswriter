<p>NATCOM, Haiti's leading telecommunications provider, has introduced two innovative services aimed at enhancing digital connectivity and financial accessibility for Haitians both domestically and internationally. The first is an international mobile top-up service, enabling customers from countries such as the United States, Canada, and France to recharge mobile accounts for their contacts in Haiti instantly. This service is made possible through partnerships with global platforms like Ding, TransferTo, and BOSS Revolution, ensuring secure and convenient transactions across borders.</p><p>Alongside the top-up service, NATCOM has launched a digital remittance platform via its Natcash Mobile Wallet, in collaboration with CAM Transfer. This platform allows Haitians in the United States to send money directly to recipients in Haiti, who can then access the funds immediately. The Natcash Mobile Wallet offers a range of functionalities, including bill payments, purchasing goods, transferring funds, and cash withdrawals through a nationwide network of agents. This initiative provides a more efficient and accessible alternative to traditional money transfer methods, addressing significant financial challenges faced by the Haitian community.</p><p>These advancements underscore NATCOM's commitment to technological innovation and social responsibility. Since its inception in 2011 as a joint venture between the Viettel Group and the Haitian government, NATCOM has been at the forefront of expanding digital infrastructure in Haiti. By facilitating economic connectivity and empowerment, NATCOM is playing a pivotal role in bridging geographical and financial divides for Haitians around the globe.</p>
