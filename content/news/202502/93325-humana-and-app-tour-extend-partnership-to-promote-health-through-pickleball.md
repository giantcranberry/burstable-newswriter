<p>The Association of Pickleball Players (APP) Tour and Humana Inc. have solidified their collaboration with a multi-year partnership extension, reinforcing Humana's role as the official healthcare partner of the premier pickleball tour. This partnership highlights the increasing importance of pickleball in fostering health and wellness, particularly among older adults, through competitive play and community engagement.</p><p>Central to this partnership is the Humana Cup, a season-long team competition that will feature two age divisions: Champions (50 and older) and Masters (60 and older). The 2025 edition will include six teams in each division, with a total of 144 professional players competing across seven APP Tour events nationwide. The competition will employ a round-robin format, leading to semifinals and finals at the APP's global headquarters in Fort Lauderdale, showcasing the sport's competitive spirit and camaraderie.</p><p>Jennifer Ilecki, Humana Chief Marketing Officer, emphasized the alignment of this partnership with Humana's mission to prioritize health for its members and communities. The initiative not only promotes physical fitness but also highlights the mental health benefits associated with active lifestyles and social interaction through sports like pickleball.</p><p>The 2025 tournament schedule is set to feature events in major U.S. cities, including the APP Vlasic Classic in Daytona Beach and the APP International Championships in Fort Lauderdale. The tour's new headquarters, equipped with 43 courts and the world's first dedicated pickleball stadium, signifies a pivotal moment in the sport's growth and professionalization.</p><p>Beyond the professional arena, Humana's presence at APP Tour events will be marked by the Humana Backcourt recovery lounge and the Humana Human Care Spotlight during national broadcasts on CBS Sports, ESPN, and FOX Sports. This partnership not only elevates the profile of pickleball but also illustrates the shifting dynamics of sports sponsorships, where health and wellness companies are increasingly investing in emerging sports to advocate for active living.</p><p>This collaboration between Humana and the APP Tour represents a forward-thinking approach to sports sponsorship, leveraging the popularity of pickleball to champion health and wellness among seniors and the broader community. As pickleball continues to be the fastest-growing sport in America, partnerships like this are pivotal in shaping the future of recreational and professional sports.</p>
