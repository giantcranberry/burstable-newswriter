<p>Technology company eQuorum has announced the upcoming release of Version 12.2 of its ImageSite and EngineBox platforms, marking a significant step forward in engineering document management. This update is designed to streamline workflow automation and data management, catering to industries such as manufacturing, facilities management, utilities, energy, and architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC).</p><p>Among the standout features of Version 12.2 is the Data List Management functionality. This innovation allows teams to create customized data lists for projects, including master document registries, vendor requirements, transmittals, and bills of materials. These lists are centrally managed, ensuring easy access and improved project coordination.</p><p>Another notable addition is the QR Code Data Linking feature. It enables users to link specific data lists with QR codes, which can then be printed and scanned on equipment or infrastructure. This facilitates quick mobile access to relevant documents and data, eliminating the need for additional software applications and enhancing on-site efficiency.</p><p>The update also brings enhanced workflow management capabilities, such as improved document control through step actions and SQL filtering. The introduction of parallel workflows is set to accelerate decision-making processes, accommodating last-minute changes and facilitating multi-disciplinary reviews more effectively.</p><p>Further improving document management, the new Document Information Pane offers comprehensive visibility into document details, including markups, notes, and approval statuses. This feature is expected to significantly expedite the review and approval processes within organizations.</p><p>Scott Brandt, CEO of eQuorum, highlighted the update's focus on workflow management and automation. According to Brandt, the new features are designed to foster greater operational discipline and efficiency by integrating work package requirements and generating automated notifications and reports.</p><p>Scheduled for release in February 2025, Version 12.2 underscores eQuorum's dedication to advancing engineering document management technology. This update is poised to have a substantial impact on the efficiency and coordination of engineering and construction projects, offering tools that address the complex needs of modern industries.</p>
