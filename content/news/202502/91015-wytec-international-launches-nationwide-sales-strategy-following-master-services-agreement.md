<p>Wytec International has announced a comprehensive nationwide sales strategy to leverage its Master Services Agreement (MSA) with the North Central Texas Council of Governments. This strategic move aims to deploy the company's cutting-edge AI gunshot detection smart sensors and private LTE solutions across a vast network, including 170 US cities, 50 counties, and more than 40 special districts. The initiative underscores Wytec's commitment to enhancing public safety through technological innovation.</p><p>Leading this ambitious expansion is Eric Garcia, newly appointed as Executive Sales Director. Garcia's extensive background in sales, with stints at Verizon Wireless, Time Warner, and Power Solar, along with his experience in training thousands of sales representatives, positions him as a key figure in Wytec's growth strategy. The company's initial focus will be on existing customer installations, with a particular emphasis on Texas Independent School Districts, integrating its in-building cellular solutions with patented AI Threat Detection Sensor Technology.</p><p>Wytec's technological advancements have already been recognized with two patents from the United States Patent and Trademark Office, with five more provisional patents filed in AI and sensor technologies. These innovations have wide-ranging applications across various public sector entities, including transit authorities, water utility boards, and police departments, highlighting the potential for significant societal impact.</p><p>Currently trading on the OTC Markets under the ticker OTCQB:WYTC, Wytec has outlined plans to uplist to the Nasdaq upon reaching certain revenue milestones. This ambition reflects the company's confidence in its growth trajectory and the broader potential of its solutions in the telecommunications and public safety sectors. The deployment of Wytec's technologies could mark a pivotal shift in how public safety is managed, offering smarter, more efficient solutions to protect communities across the United States.</p>
