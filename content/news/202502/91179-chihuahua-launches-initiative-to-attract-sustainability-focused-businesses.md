This initiative, led by Startup Chihuahua in collaboration with local government and business leaders, seeks to create a nurturing environment for international enterprises looking to expand or relocate.</p><p>Ulises Fern√°ndez of the Innovation and Economic Development Secretariat highlights the region's progress through these collaborative efforts. The strategy is designed to offer incoming businesses access to capital investments, equity-free grants, and corporate sponsorship opportunities, alongside workforce development programs and networking with local industry leaders. This approach not only benefits the relocating companies but also strengthens the local economy by fostering innovation and job creation.</p><p>Chihuahua City emerges as a prime location for businesses considering nearshoring, thanks to its strategic position along the U.S. border and comprehensive transportation infrastructure. The city's safe environment, growing middle class, and strong educational system further enhance its appeal as a business destination.
