<p>Aemetis, a leader in renewable fuels, has reported that its California ethanol plant has exceeded $2 billion in cumulative revenues. The Keyes plant, operational since 2011, has produced 768 million gallons of ethanol, contributing $1.6 billion to this total, alongside 5.2 million tons of wet distillers grain valued at $400 million, supporting local agriculture.</p><p>The company is now focusing on a $25 million Mechanical Vapor Recompression (MVR) system, expected to be installed by late 2025 and fully operational in the first half of 2026. This innovative project aims to cut natural gas consumption by 80% by leveraging high-capacity turbofans powered by lower-carbon electricity, marking a significant step towards environmental sustainability and operational efficiency.</p><p>Financial benefits from the MVR project are multifaceted. Beyond the substantial energy cost savings, the reduction in carbon intensity of ethanol production could unlock government incentives, including an estimated $22 million in annual cash flow improvements under the Treasury's Section 45Z guidance. Additionally, California's Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS) credits could add up to $12 million annually at current prices.</p><p>A 2-megawatt solar installation at the Keyes plant further supports the initiative, aligning with Aemetis' sustainability objectives. The combined advantages of LCFS credits, new revenue opportunities, and energy savings are projected to boost annual cash flow by over $40 million starting in 2026.</p><p>This strategic endeavor highlights Aemetis' dedication to pioneering eco-friendly manufacturing solutions in the renewable fuels industry, showcasing the potential for technology to reconcile economic growth with environmental stewardship.</p>
