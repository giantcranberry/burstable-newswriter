<p>Alliance Resource Partners, L.P. (NASDAQ: ARLP) has reported a challenging fourth quarter for 2024, with total revenues declining by 5.6% year-over-year to $590.1 million. This performance, as analyzed by Stonegate Capital Partners, underscores the broader pressures facing the industry, including lower coal sales pricing and heightened operating expenses. The company's net income significantly decreased to $16.3 million from $115.4 million in the same quarter of the previous year, attributed in part to non-cash impairment charges of $31.1 million related to the MC Mining operation.</p><p>Despite these hurdles, Alliance Resource Partners showcased resilience with an adjusted EBITDA of $124.0 million, although this marks a 27.2% sequential decline. The coal operations segment saw a 3.3% year-over-year drop in sales revenue to $504.6 million, with coal sales volumes decreasing by 2.3% to 8.4 million tons. The Illinois Basin segment, however, demonstrated some strength with a 2.8% increase in sales volumes, contrasting with the Appalachia segment's 17.1% decline due to reduced production at Tunnel Ridge.</p><p>The company's strong liquidity position, standing at $593.9 million including $137.0 million in cash and $456.9 million in available credit, alongside generating $75.2 million in free cash flow for the quarter, underscores its financial stability. This brings the year-to-date free cash flow total to $383.5 million. The royalty business segment also faced challenges, with total royalty revenues falling 8.6% year-over-year to $48.5 million, despite a slight 1.7% increase in oil and gas royalty volumes.</p><p>Looking forward, Alliance Resource Partners is optimistic about its fiscal year 2025 guidance, expecting improvements from operational efficiencies, a strengthening order book, and declining domestic inventories. The company's decision to maintain its quarterly cash distribution at $0.70 per unit reflects confidence in its financial health. Stonegate Capital Partners' valuation of the company at $27.89 to $30.97 per unit, based on an EV/EBITDA framework, suggests a balanced view of current challenges and future growth potential in the dynamic energy market landscape.</p>
