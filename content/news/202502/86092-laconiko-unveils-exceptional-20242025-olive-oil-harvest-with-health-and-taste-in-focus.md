<p>Laconiko, renowned for its award-winning single-origin extra virgin olive oils (EVOO), has announced the release of its 2024/2025 harvest from Southern Greece, featuring two standout varieties that promise not only exceptional taste but also notable nutritional benefits. The Laconiko Estate Olive Oil and Laconiko Olio Nuovo are the stars of this year's harvest, each offering unique flavors and health-promoting properties.</p><p>The Estate Olive Oil is characterized by its grassy and artichoke notes, alongside a polyphenol count of 538mg/kg, indicating a robust antioxidant profile. Meanwhile, the Olio Nuovo stands out as the first certified high phenolic EVOO in North America, with an impressive 877mg/kg of polyphenols and a high oleocanthal content of 503mg/kg, underscoring its potential anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and cardioprotective benefits.</p><p>Diamantis Pierrakos, co-owner of Laconiko, shared his enthusiasm for the harvest, likening the introduction of these new products to welcoming a new member into the family. The 2024/2025 harvest is notable not only for its quality but also for the quantity produced, with olives meticulously picked and processed to preserve their nutritional integrity.</p><p>Pierrakos also offered valuable advice for consumers looking to navigate the premium olive oil market: opt for extra virgin olive oil for superior quality, check the harvest date to ensure freshness, and choose packaging that shields the oil from light to prevent degradation. These tips highlight the importance of informed choices in enjoying the full benefits of high-quality olive oil.</p><p>Available through Laconiko's online shop, Manassas showroom, and select specialty retailers across the nation, this harvest continues the company's legacy as a fourth-generation family business dedicated to producing premium olive oil from organic Koroneiki olives in Lakonia, Greece. The introduction of these varieties, especially the Olio Nuovo, represents a significant advancement in the EVOO market, offering consumers not just a culinary delight but a product packed with health-enhancing properties.</p>
