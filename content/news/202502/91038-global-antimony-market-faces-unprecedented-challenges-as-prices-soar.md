<p>The global antimony market is currently under significant strain, with prices reaching an all-time high of $51,000 per ton. This surge is attributed to tightening export controls in China and escalating international demand for this critical mineral. Antimony plays a vital role in the production of military ammunition, missile systems, flame retardants, and advanced electronics, making it a strategic resource for Western nations aiming to reduce their reliance on foreign suppliers.</p><p>China and Russia dominate nearly 100% of the global antimony production, posing vulnerabilities for NATO and Western countries. The conflict in Ukraine has further exacerbated the situation, depleting stockpiles and emphasizing the need for diversified supply chains. In response, several mining companies are stepping up to address this crisis. Military Metals Corp., Perpetua Resources Corp., United States Antimony Corporation, and Nova Minerals Limited are at the forefront of developing domestic antimony resources in North America.</p><p>Perpetua Resources' Stibnite Gold Project in Idaho is notable for its potential to supply 35% of the U.S. antimony demand within its first six years of operation, thanks to its estimated 148 million pounds of antimony reserves. This project not only aims to lessen dependence on foreign sources but also includes efforts to restore the environment. Similarly, Military Metals Corp. is making strides with projects in North America and Europe, including the Trojárová Antimony-Gold Project in Slovakia, to fill the critical mineral supply gap.</p><p>United States Antimony Corporation is expanding its operations by acquiring mining claims in Alaska and upgrading its Madero smelter in Mexico, focusing on enhancing domestic antimony production. Nova Minerals Limited is also contributing to the solution with its Estelle Critical Minerals Project in Alaska, where high-grade antimony concentrations have been discovered, marking it as a promising domestic supplier.</p><p>These efforts transcend mere economic ventures; they are pivotal to national security. By establishing alternative antimony sources, these companies are playing a crucial role in mitigating geopolitical risks and ensuring a steady supply for defense, technology, and industrial sectors, thereby safeguarding the interests of Western nations.</p>
