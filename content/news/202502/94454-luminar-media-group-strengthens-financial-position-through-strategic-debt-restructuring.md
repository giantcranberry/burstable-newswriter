<p>Luminar Media Group has announced a comprehensive financial restructuring aimed at addressing legacy debt and safeguarding shareholder interests. The company has retired $150,232.34 of convertible notes, accounting for 32% of its debt inherited from a May 2024 reverse merger. Additionally, $110,000 of outstanding debt has been reassigned to new lenders, featuring a six-month conversion moratorium, thereby reducing immediate conversion risks by 23%.</p><p>CEO Yoel Damas highlighted the strategic nature of these measures, revealing that approximately $200,000 in new financing was raised to specifically target debt reduction. This financing is characterized by extended repayment periods and restructured conversion features, tailored to align with prevailing market conditions. The company initially took on $472,821.83 in convertible notes, with conversion terms set at $0.01 per share, mirroring the stock's average trading price of $0.015 at the time. Foreseeing the risk of significant shareholder dilution, management engaged in negotiations with legacy noteholders to revise and postpone conversion terms.</p><p>Further solidifying its financial strategy, Luminar Media Group has obtained agreements from holders of $212,589.49 in remaining legacy debt, representing 45% of the original total, to discuss terms and defer conversions. This move not only affords the company greater financial leeway but also underscores its commitment to disciplined capital management. Specializing in financial solutions for underserved communities, particularly Latino and minority-owned businesses, Luminar Media Group continues to prioritize transparency and the maximization of long-term shareholder value. The recent debt restructuring efforts exemplify the company's dedication to prudent financial practices and effective risk management.</p>
