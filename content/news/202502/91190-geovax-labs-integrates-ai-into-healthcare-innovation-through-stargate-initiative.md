<p>Biotechnology firm GeoVax Labs has taken a significant step forward by integrating artificial intelligence (AI) technologies into its research and development processes, aligning with President Donald J. Trump's Stargate Initiative. This move places GeoVax at the cutting edge of healthcare innovation, utilizing AI to revolutionize vaccine development and cancer treatment methodologies.</p><p>The company's AI-driven approach focuses on the Modified Vaccinia Ankara (MVA) platform to develop variant-proof vaccines for diseases such as COVID-19, Mpox, and Smallpox. This strategy not only aims to address current health crises but also prepares for future pandemics by enhancing the speed and efficiency of vaccine development.</p><p>In the realm of cancer immunotherapy, GeoVax is employing advanced predictive modeling to refine Gene-Directed Enzyme Prodrug Therapy (GDEPT) for treating solid tumors. The AI technology facilitates real-time adjustments to treatment protocols and identifies effective combinations with immune checkpoint inhibitors, offering new hope for cancer patients.</p><p>David Dodd, Chairman and CEO of GeoVax, highlighted the transformative potential of this initiative, underscoring its role in advancing healthcare innovation. The integration of AI into GeoVax's operations is expected to streamline clinical trials, improve patient stratification, and ensure that therapies are accessible to underserved populations, thereby addressing critical healthcare disparities.</p><p>Supported by the Stargate Initiative, which encourages up to $500 billion in private-sector investment, GeoVax's AI integration is a pivotal development in U.S. healthcare innovation. By collaborating with academic, industry, and federal partners, GeoVax aims to amplify the impact of its programs, setting a new standard for medical research and pandemic preparedness.</p>
