<p>Flash, a leader in parking and mobility technology, has announced the appointment of Jim Zeitunian as its new Chief Technology Officer (CTO). This strategic hire is set to accelerate the company's expansion into AI-enabled parking solutions and digital infrastructure, marking a pivotal moment in the parking and mobility sector's digital transformation. Zeitunian's extensive experience in transforming traditional businesses into AI-forward technology companies positions him as a key player in driving Flash's vision forward.</p><p>With a career spanning decades, Zeitunian has a proven track record of scaling AI platforms and modernizing legacy industries. His most recent role as CTO at Powerfleet saw him successfully transition a conventional fleet management operation into a data-driven SaaS enterprise. Prior to that, Zeitunian developed enterprise SaaS platforms at Coupa Software and Thomson Reuters, working closely with Fortune 500 clients. His expertise is expected to be instrumental in evolving Flash's parking management platform and connected mobility services.</p><p>Reporting directly to Flash president Chris Donus, Zeitunian will oversee global engineering, product management, design, and quality assurance teams. His primary focus will be on enhancing Flash's AI capabilities across its product portfolio, scaling its cloud-based operating system to accommodate growing transaction volumes, and integrating parking, EV charging, and mobility services into a seamless digital experience. 'Jim's track record of modernizing legacy industries through AI and cloud technologies aligns perfectly with Flash's vision,' remarked Dan Sharplin, Flash's CEO and Chairman.</p><p>This appointment underscores Flash's commitment to leveraging technology to revolutionize urban mobility. The company's platform facilitates reservable parking and charging through commonly used driver apps, connecting various parking facilities via a cloud-based operating system. This innovative approach aims to minimize the time drivers spend searching for parking, reduce emissions from idling vehicles, and enhance the overall parking experience in urban settings. 'The parking industry is ready for an AI-driven revolution, and Flash is poised to lead it,' Zeitunian stated, highlighting the company's ambition to create an intelligent parking network that transforms urban mobility.</p><p>The move is a clear indication of the parking industry's shift towards smart, connected solutions that integrate with broader urban mobility systems. As urban areas continue to expand and grapple with transportation challenges, the development of intelligent parking infrastructure is becoming increasingly vital for operational efficiency and environmental sustainability. Flash's initiative, under Zeitunian's leadership, represents a forward-thinking approach to addressing these challenges, setting a new standard for the industry.</p>
