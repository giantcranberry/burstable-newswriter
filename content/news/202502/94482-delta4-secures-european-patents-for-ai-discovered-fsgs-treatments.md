<p>Vienna-based biotechnology company Delta4 has achieved a significant milestone by securing European patents for two innovative compounds aimed at treating focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), a rare and severe kidney disorder. This breakthrough underscores the transformative role of artificial intelligence in drug discovery, particularly for diseases with limited treatment options.</p><p>The first compound, clopidogrel, already approved for cardiovascular conditions, has shown exceptional promise in preclinical studies for FSGS. Research demonstrated a 61% reduction in the urinary albumin to creatinine ratio and a 67.9% decrease in kidney damage scores, alongside beneficial anti-inflammatory, anti-fibrotic, and immune-modulating effects. These findings suggest a potential new avenue for treating FSGS by repurposing existing medications.</p><p>The second patented treatment involves a novel combination of saroglitazar and myristic acid (Saro+Myr), which has shown efficacy in reducing proteinuria and improving kidney pathology in animal models. This combination targets critical disease mechanisms, including inflammation and fibrosis, offering hope for a more effective treatment strategy.</p><p>Central to these discoveries is Delta4's Hyper-C platform, an advanced AI system capable of analyzing vast biomedical datasets to uncover molecular relationships between diseases and existing drugs. This technology enables the prediction of therapeutic mechanisms and potential drug efficacy with remarkable accuracy, accelerating the drug discovery process.</p><p>Kurt Herpel, CEO of Delta4, highlighted the importance of these patents, noting the platform's ability to uncover innovative treatment strategies. The company is now preparing to advance these compounds into clinical trials, with the aim of validating the encouraging preclinical results.</p><p>These developments represent a pivotal advancement in the fight against FSGS, a condition that has long eluded comprehensive treatment solutions. By leveraging AI to repurpose known drugs and identify novel therapeutic combinations, Delta4 is at the forefront of a new era in medicine, where technology and biology converge to address some of the most challenging health issues.</p>
