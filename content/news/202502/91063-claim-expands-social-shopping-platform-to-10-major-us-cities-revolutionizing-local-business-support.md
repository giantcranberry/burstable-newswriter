<p>Claim, a social shopping platform initially launched at Harvard University and later expanded across more than 90 college campuses, has now broadened its reach to include 10 major U.S. cities. This strategic move opens the platform to all residents and visitors in Atlanta, Austin, Boston, Chicago, Dallas-Fort Worth, Houston, Los Angeles, New York, Philadelphia, and Washington, D.C., eliminating the previous requirement for a college email address.</p><p>The platform's unique model offers users the opportunity to earn cash back, referred to as 'Claims,' when they patronize partner businesses such as Blank Street Coffee, Gong cha, and Chip City. This initiative not only benefits consumers but also provides local businesses with a novel customer acquisition channel. CEO and co-founder Sam Obletz pointed out that Claim redirects marketing budgets directly to consumers, presenting an alternative to costly digital advertising channels.</p><p>At the heart of Claim's strategy is an AI-powered algorithm designed to encourage repeat customer engagement by rewarding users for exploring new establishments. Additionally, the platform has introduced a referral program, offering users $10 in Claims for every friend they invite, further incentivizing organic growth. Luke deWilde, Head of Marketing, highlighted that existing users in the core cities will continue to enjoy the platform's benefits, with future offerings tailored to these urban markets.</p><p>This expansion signifies a significant shift in how Gen Z and young professionals interact with local businesses, creating a rewards-based ecosystem that benefits both consumers and businesses alike. By leveraging technology to foster community engagement and support for local economies, Claim is setting a new standard in the social shopping domain.</p>
