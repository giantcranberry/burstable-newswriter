<p>Protocase and its subsidiary 45Drives have taken a significant step in their U.S. manufacturing expansion by commencing production at a new 12,000-square-foot facility in Wilmington, North Carolina. Located at 4270 US Highway 421, the facility is set to initially focus on sub-assembly for 45Drives, with ambitions to scale to full production for both entities within the coming year. This strategic move is designed to enhance service delivery to U.S. customers through an integrated workflow that connects Protocase's headquarters in Sydney, Nova Scotia, with the new Wilmington site.</p><p>The facility's initial operations will rely on components sourced from existing supply chains, with metal parts coming from Sydney and being assembled in Wilmington. By mid-March, the site is expected to begin assembling complex 45Drives Storinator and Storinator Hybrid servers, with a future transition to full production for U.S. customers and the introduction of the new ultra-performance Stornado F16 server. Doug Milburn, President of 45Drives, underscored the company's dedication to U.S. manufacturing, aiming to bring high-value, high-density manufacturing to Wilmington. Steve Lilley, President of Protocase, highlighted the facility's role in improving service efficiency for U.S. customers while driving innovation in precision manufacturing and data infrastructure.</p><p>Designed with a focus on employee density and efficiency, the Wilmington facility is poised to contribute to job creation in the region. As Protocase and 45Drives expand, they plan to add more roles to support their growing operational capacity. This expansion leverages their expertise in <a href="https://www.protocase.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">High Velocity Mass Customization (HVMC)</a>, offering flexible, cost-effective manufacturing solutions. The facility is expected to gradually increase its production capabilities, including the on-site manufacturing of circuit boards and metal components.</p><p>This new manufacturing site reflects Protocase and 45Drives' commitment to innovation, customer service, and domestic manufacturing, positioning them to meet the rising demand for custom computing systems in the United States more effectively.</p>
