<p>The Copper Property CTL Pass Through Trust has disclosed its January 2025 financial performance, announcing a distribution of $6.20 million, equating to $0.082711 per trust certificate. Scheduled for payment on February 10, 2025, this distribution is earmarked for certificateholders recorded as of February 7, 2025. This month's payout is noted to be below the Trust's usual monthly distribution, a deviation attributed to the settlement of annual expenses such as insurance and Trustee fees in January.</p><p>Further detailing its January activities, the Trust completed its mandated semi-annual Broker's Opinion of Value (BOV) assessments, a critical step in evaluating its asset portfolio's market value. Originating from J.C. Penney's Chapter 11 reorganization, the Trust holds a significant real estate portfolio, including 160 retail properties and 6 warehouse distribution centers, with the primary goal of accelerating the sale of these assets to third-party buyers.</p><p>Managed by an affiliate of Hilco Real Estate LLC and with GLAS Trust Company LLC acting as Trustee, the Trust operates under a liquidating trust structure for tax purposes. This framework supports a focused strategy towards property management and divestment, aiming to maximize returns for certificateholders. For those seeking in-depth insights into the Trust's operations and financial health, comprehensive reports are accessible via the <a href='http://www.ctltrust.net' rel='nofollow' target='_blank'>CTL Trust website</a> and SEC filings, offering transparency and detailed analysis for investors and stakeholders.</p>
