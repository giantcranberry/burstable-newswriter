<p>US Nuclear Corp. has initiated the process of quoting and delivering up to 80 Gauntlet Sentry Radiation Detection Systems to a border state housing nuclear reactor sites, showcasing a leap forward in security technology. The Gauntlet Sentry system, developed by US Nuclear Corp., is designed for comprehensive detection, capable of identifying radiation and explosives, thereby offering a robust solution for enhancing security measures.</p><p>Bob Goldstein, President of US Nuclear Corp., underscored the system's adaptability, pointing to its wide-ranging applications from border security to safeguarding government buildings and military installations. A notable feature of the Gauntlet Sentry system is its ability to detect Tritium, an essential component in nuclear fusion research, further broadening its utility in critical security and scientific applications.</p><p>The company's Overhoff Technology division has seen a notable increase in demand, recently finalizing a significant deal for 10 400SB and 15 357Rm Tritium air monitors, with an estimated value of $500,000, set for delivery in the second quarter. This uptick in orders reflects the growing need for advanced radiation detection solutions in various sectors.</p><p>On the financial front, US Nuclear Corp. is engaged in advanced merger discussions that could bolster its annual revenues by $4-5 million and net income by $1-1.5 million. These discussions, expected to conclude in the second quarter following due diligence, highlight the company's strategic approach to growth and market expansion.</p><p>Operational efficiencies are also a key focus for US Nuclear Corp., with the merger of its Los Angeles and Ohio operations over halfway complete. This consolidation is anticipated to yield substantial cost savings, estimated at $60-80,000 per month, or nearly $1 million annually, contributing approximately $0.02 per share in savings. These initiatives underscore US Nuclear Corp.'s dedication to innovation, strategic growth, and operational excellence in the fields of radiation detection and security technology.</p>
