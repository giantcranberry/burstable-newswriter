<p>The face painting industry has witnessed a notable innovation with the introduction of Jest Paint's GTX Water Resistant Cream Kit. This silicone-based solution is set to redefine the standards of temporary skin decoration, offering a blend of durability, versatility, and safety that surpasses traditional alcohol-based formulas. The kit, comprising 15 airless pump bottles of 15ml specialized cream paint, is designed to meet the demands of both professional artists and enthusiasts, especially in challenging environments like outdoor festivals and summer parties.</p><p>What sets the GTX paint apart is its elimination of strong odors and potential skin irritation, common drawbacks of conventional face paints. Its unique formulation ensures seamless blending and extended working time, allowing for the creation of intricate designs and full-face artwork with ease. The slow-drying properties of the paint not only provide artists with additional flexibility during application but also ensure vibrant color retention, enhancing the overall quality of the artwork.</p><p>The GTX kit boasts a diverse color palette, including shades like True Black, Rodeo Red, Blue Bonnet, Corn Bread Yellow, and Plum Pie, catering to a wide range of creative expressions. With a 36-month shelf life, the product offers long-term value, making it a worthwhile investment for users. Developed by Amber Massa, a professional with a background in permanent makeup ink development, the GTX line is the result of global collaboration with artists. It is MOCRA-registered in the United States and uses FDA-compliant pigments, underscoring its commitment to safety and quality.</p><p>Application of the GTX paint is straightforward, requiring artists to pump small dots onto a palette, load a dry brush, and apply directly to the skin. Its compatibility with glitter tattoo adhesive stencils further enhances its versatility. For removal, oil-based cleansers, micellar water, or natural oils like coconut and olive oil are recommended, ensuring a hassle-free cleanup process. Brush maintenance is equally simple, involving cleaning with alcohol between uses and allowing complete drying.</p><p>The GTX Water Resistant Cream Kit by Jest Paint represents a leap forward in face painting technology, offering a reliable, high-performance solution that combines artistic flexibility with long-lasting durability. Its introduction is poised to have a significant impact on the face painting industry, providing professionals and hobbyists alike with a product that meets their creative and practical needs.</p>
