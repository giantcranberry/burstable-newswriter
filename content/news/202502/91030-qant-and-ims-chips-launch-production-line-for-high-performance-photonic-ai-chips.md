<p>The partnership between Q.ANT and the Institute of Microelectronics Stuttgart (IMS CHIPS) has culminated in the creation of a dedicated production line for high-performance photonic AI chips. This initiative marks a significant leap forward in semiconductor manufacturing and computational technology, with an investment of €14 million in machinery and equipment. The production line, capable of producing up to 1,000 wafers annually, leverages an upcycled CMOS production facility and Q.ANT's patented photonic chip technology to set a new standard for sustainable and resilient semiconductor production.</p><p>Photonic chips stand out by computing with light rather than electricity, offering a 30-fold increase in energy efficiency and a 50-fold boost in computing speed over traditional technologies. The use of Thin-Film Lithium Niobate (TFLN) in these chips allows for ultra-fast optical signal manipulation without the need for heat modulation, further enhancing their performance and efficiency.</p><p>Dr. Michael Förtsch, CEO of Q.ANT, highlighted the initiative's role in advancing sustainable AI chip technology, targeting critical computing workloads such as AI model training, scientific simulations, and complex mathematical operations. Prof. Dr. Jens Anders, Director and CEO of IMS CHIPS, pointed out the project's potential to meet the computational demands spurred by the rapid growth of AI and data-intensive applications.</p><p>This collaboration not only showcases how transformative technologies can utilize existing infrastructure to foster innovation but also aims to democratize semiconductor production. By reducing reliance on global supply chains and speeding up the development of essential technologies, the partnership is poised to benefit data centers, research institutions, and advanced industries. Q.ANT's vision for 2030 includes establishing photonic processors as a scalable, energy-efficient foundation for AI infrastructure, signaling a promising future for the industry.</p>
