<p>UGI Utilities, Inc. has embarked on a critical gas main replacement initiative in Manheim Township, Lancaster County, starting February 10, with completion aimed for late April. This project underscores the company's dedication to upgrading utility infrastructure to ensure safety and reliability for its customers. The construction will notably affect Pleasure Road between Crest Lane and Hilltop Approach, Crest Lane between Pleasure Road and Skyline Drive, and Tusitala Drive between Pleasure Road and Crest Lane.</p><p>Operating hours are set from 7 a.m. to 5 p.m., Monday through Friday, potentially causing traffic disruptions and temporary natural gas service interruptions. Local residents and businesses should anticipate road closures, detours, and delays, with parking restrictions in place on the affected streets. UGI will also need access to properties to inspect and relight equipment, a necessary step in the infrastructure enhancement process.</p><p>An added benefit of this project is the opportunity for certain properties along the construction route to convert to natural gas service, aligning with broader efforts to promote cleaner energy sources. However, the project's timeline could be influenced by adverse weather conditions or unforeseen working challenges, possibly extending beyond the late April target.</p><p>This initiative is a testament to UGI Utilities' ongoing commitment to maintaining and improving the utility infrastructure that serves its customers. By prioritizing safety and reliability, the company not only addresses current infrastructure needs but also lays the groundwork for future energy solutions.
