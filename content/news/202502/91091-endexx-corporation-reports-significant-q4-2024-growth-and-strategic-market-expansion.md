<p>Endexx Corporation, trading under OTC: EDXC, has announced a remarkable 164% year-over-year revenue increase in its Q4 2024 results, achieving $632,000 in revenue and improving its gross margin to 46.5%. This financial progress underscores the company's strategic positioning for future market expansion and its ability to capitalize on the growing demand for wellness products.</p><p>Interim CEO Brad Listermann detailed the company's multifaceted strategy to sustain growth, which includes forging major distribution agreements, broadening product offerings, and strengthening e-commerce platforms. A significant development is the partnership with American Shaman, set to introduce HYLA's zero-nicotine products to 40 stores, with the potential to expand to 300 locations, marking a pivotal step in Endexx's retail penetration.</p><p>Anticipating the launch of a new nicotine-free pouch line in early 2025, Endexx is targeting online sales channels, benefiting from fewer regulatory hurdles than those faced by traditional vaping products. This move aligns with consumer trends towards healthier lifestyle choices and positions Endexx as a forward-thinking player in the wellness industry.</p><p>Financial restructuring has been a key focus for Endexx, with efforts to reduce operating expenses while boosting revenue. The appointment of Doug Williams, CPA, as Fractional CFO, and the conversion of debt into equity, reflect the company's commitment to financial health and transparency. The removal of its Yield sign from OTC Markets listing further attests to its improved compliance and operational integrity.</p><p>International markets present a lucrative opportunity for Endexx, with ongoing order fulfillments and expansion talks in various regions. The HYLA division's emphasis on plant-based, nicotine-free products caters to the global shift towards wellness and sustainability, offering a competitive edge in the international arena.</p><p>Looking ahead, Endexx is poised to secure large-scale distribution deals, innovate its product line, and obtain more favorable financing terms, leveraging its proven revenue growth and expansion capabilities. These strategic initiatives not only highlight Endexx's potential for sustained success but also its contribution to shaping the future of the wellness industry.</p>
