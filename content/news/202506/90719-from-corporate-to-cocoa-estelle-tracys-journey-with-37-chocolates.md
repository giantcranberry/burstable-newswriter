<p>Estelle Tracy's journey from a corporate background to establishing 37 Chocolates underscores a remarkable shift towards passion-driven entrepreneurship in the craft chocolate sector. Originally from France and now based in Philadelphia, Tracy's venture began as a personal challenge to review 37 chocolate bars for her 37th birthday. This initiative not only introduced her to the rich diversity of craft chocolate but also paved the way for her current role as a chocolate sommelier and educator.</p><p>With a masterâ€™s degree in analytical chemistry and experience as a food blogger, Tracy brings a unique perspective to the world of gourmet chocolate. Her approach demystifies the often intimidating realm of craft chocolate, focusing on simplicity and encouraging individuals to trust their own taste. This philosophy has fostered a community of chocolate enthusiasts eager to explore and learn about chocolate's varied flavors and origins.</p><p>The path from hobby to business was fraught with challenges, including skepticism and the logistical complications brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic. Tracy's resilience and people-first approach have been instrumental in navigating these hurdles. Notably, her decision to support a colleague by purchasing her inventory, despite the financial risks, reflects her commitment to community and collaboration within the industry.</p><p>37 Chocolates extends beyond mere tastings, offering educational events and storytelling sessions with experts from chocolate-producing regions. These initiatives aim to enrich the public's understanding of chocolate's complex world, from bean to bar. Tracy's vision for the future is clear: to continue educating and uniting people through their shared love of chocolate, proving that passion and perseverance can indeed transform a simple idea into a thriving, impactful business.</p>
