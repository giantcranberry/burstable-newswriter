<p>UGI Utilities has announced the commencement of system upgrades in Bethlehem starting July 1, as part of its commitment to maintaining safe and reliable service. The project involves the replacement of a gas main on East North Street between Pine Street and Center Street, and on Center Street between East North Street and East Raspberry Street. Construction hours are set from 7am to 5pm, Monday through Friday, with parking restrictions in place during these times.</p><p>The upgrades may lead to temporary interruptions in natural gas service, requiring UGI to access properties for equipment inspection and relighting. The underground work is expected to be completed by the end of July, although adverse weather or working conditions could prolong the timeline. Following the underground work, final paving and restoration will be carried out.</p><p>This project not only aims to enhance the infrastructure but also provides an opportunity for residences and businesses along the project route to switch to natural gas. UGI is encouraging those interested in converting to natural gas to seek more information.
