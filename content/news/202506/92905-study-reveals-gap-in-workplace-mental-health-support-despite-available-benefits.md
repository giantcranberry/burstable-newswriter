<p>A recent study by the HR.com Research Institute, 'HR.com's State of Employee Mental Health & Stress in the Workplace 2025', reveals a critical gap in the effectiveness of mental health support within organizations. Despite 89% of companies offering mental health benefits, only 28% of employees find these benefits helpful in managing workplace stress. This discrepancy points to a broader issue of inadequate support systems, with 61% of employees frequently experiencing stress at work, yet less than half of organizations having effective mechanisms to address these challenges.</p><p>The study also notes a worrying trend in employee perception of organizational support, with 34% of respondents feeling their companies do not go beyond basic benefits to tackle mental health issues. This represents a 15-point increase from the previous year, signaling a growing dissatisfaction among workers. Additionally, the research found that only 9% of organizations actively assess employee mental health, leaving many without the data needed to improve support services. The lack of preparedness among managers is another concern, with just 15% trained to guide stressed employees and 14% able to recognize stress signs.</p><p>Debbie McGrath, CEO of HR.com, calls for a cultural shift within organizations to prioritize mental health, including better manager training and leadership accountability. The findings serve as a wake-up call for businesses to reassess and strengthen their mental health support systems, ensuring a healthier and more productive workforce. This study underscores the importance of addressing mental health in the workplace, not only for employee well-being but also for organizational success.</p>
