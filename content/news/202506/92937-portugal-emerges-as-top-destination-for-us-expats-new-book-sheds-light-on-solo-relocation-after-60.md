<p>Portugal has recently been identified as the leading destination for U.S. expatriates, a trend underscored by Barbara Grassey's latest publication, 'American Expat: Moving Abroad Solo After 60.' Launched on June 24th, the book provides a comprehensive look at the realities of moving to a foreign country later in life, blending practical advice with personal stories.</p><p>Grassey's work is particularly timely, as an increasing number of Americans, especially women over 50, are considering overseas relocation.

'American Expat' addresses these motivations head-on, offering readers a candid exploration of the emotional and logistical challenges involved.</p><p>The book distinguishes itself by moving past the often romanticized notions of expatriate living. Grassey shares her firsthand experiences with the complexities of obtaining visas, managing finances abroad, and the emotional toll of starting over in a new country. Her narrative serves as both a cautionary tale and a source of inspiration for those contemplating a similar journey.</p><p>Available on <a href='https://www.amazon.com' rel='nofollow' target='_blank'>Amazon</a> in both paperback and ebook formats, 'American Expat' is poised to become an essential resource for older Americans dreaming of a new beginning overseas.
