<p>Lantern Pharma Inc. (NASDAQ: LTRN), a clinical-stage biotechnology company, is pioneering the use of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning in oncology to fast-track the discovery and development of targeted cancer therapies. At the core of its innovative approach is the RADR(R) platform, a cutting-edge technology that analyzes over 200 billion oncology-specific data points. This enables the company to swiftly identify promising drug candidates and tailor clinical trials for specific patient groups and cancer types, marking a significant leap forward in personalized medicine.</p><p>The company's pipeline includes three lead drug candidates targeting non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), areas with high unmet medical needs. Furthermore, through Starlight Therapeutics, Lantern Pharma is extending its research into brain and central nervous system (CNS) cancers, including rare pediatric cancers, supported by orphan and rare disease designations from the FDA. These designations underscore the therapeutic potential of Lantern's candidates and facilitate a smoother regulatory review process.</p><p>With a solid financial foundation of approximately $19.7 million in cash and equivalents, Lantern Pharma is well-positioned to advance its drug development pipeline and platform technology through at least mid-2026. The company's work is not just a testament to the power of AI in drug discovery but also a beacon of hope for patients battling hard-to-treat cancers. By combining large-scale genomics, AI-driven biomarker discovery, and preclinical modeling, Lantern Pharma is setting a new standard in oncology research, promising more effective and personalized treatment options that could significantly improve patient outcomes and quality of life.</p>
