<p>Pixee, a cybersecurity startup based in Baltimore, has announced the closure of a $15 million seed funding round. This round saw participation from Maryland's technology development agency, TEDCO, and was led by Decibel and Wing VC from Palo Alto, California. Additional investments came from PrimeSet of Brazil and strategic investors including GitHub engineer Zach Holman, HackerOne founder Alex Rice, and Oracle's senior vice president of Cloud Operations, Brian Chess.</p><p>Founded by CEO Surag Patel and CTO Arshan Dabirsiaghi, Pixee is pioneering the use of agentic AI and deterministic techniques to automate the remediation of vulnerabilities in application security. This approach aims to shorten the patch time for security flaws from months to days, addressing a critical need in the cybersecurity industry. The significance of Pixee's technology is underscored by IDC's prediction that by 2027, 70% of corrective code fixes for application security issues will be generated by AI-assisted automated remediation tools.</p><p>Patel and Dabirsiaghi's extensive experience, including leadership roles at Contrast Security, where Dabirsiaghi was a co-founder, has been instrumental in developing Pixee's tools. These tools are designed to integrate smoothly into developer workflows across platforms such as GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, and Azure DevOps, offering automated, production-ready code fixes.</p><p>TEDCO CEO Troy LeMaile-Stovall highlighted Maryland's position as a center for cybersecurity talent and innovation, noting that the investment in Pixee reflects the state's strategy to bolster the growth of cybersecurity businesses. Pixee has already demonstrated impressive results, with enterprise customers reporting a 91% recapture of developer remediation time, a 74% reduction in security triage time, and a 76% merge rate for automated code fixes.</p><p>The seed funding will support Pixee in accelerating product development and expanding its go-to-market team, further solidifying its role in the cybersecurity sector. This investment not only emphasizes the increasing role of AI in cybersecurity but also showcases Maryland's dedication to leading in technological innovation and security solutions.</p>
