<p>Direxion Shares ETF Trust has announced the liquidation and closure of two of its exchange-traded funds (ETFs), the Direxion Daily Travel & Vacation Bull 2X Shares (OOTO) and the Direxion Daily Cloud Computing Bull 2X Shares (CLDL), effective July 24, 2025. This decision was made following a recommendation from the Fundsâ€™ adviser, Rafferty Asset Management, LLC, due to the funds' inability to attract sufficient investment assets. The Board of Trustees determined that liquidation and closure would be in the best interest of the Funds and their shareholders.</p><p>The ETFs will stop trading on the NYSE Arca, Inc., and purchase orders will no longer be accepted after the closing date. Shareholders are advised to sell their holdings before July 24, 2025, to avoid potential difficulties in finding buyers during the liquidation phase from July 24 to July 30, 2025. During this period, the Funds will not track their underlying indices, deviating from their intended investment objectives.</p><p>On or around the Liquidation Date, each Fund will distribute cash pro rata to remaining shareholders, marking a taxable event. These distributions may include accrued capital gains and dividends, with the net asset value adjusted to reflect the costs associated with the Funds' closure. After completing these distributions, the Funds will officially terminate.</p><p>This development highlights the inherent challenges niche ETFs face in maintaining adequate asset levels to remain operational, underscoring the critical role of investor interest and favorable market conditions in the viability of specialized financial products.
