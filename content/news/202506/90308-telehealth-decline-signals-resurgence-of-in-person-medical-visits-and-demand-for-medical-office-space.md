<p>The COVID-19 pandemic initially saw a surge in telehealth services, but recent data from the Center for Telehealth and e-Health Law (CTeL) indicates a significant shift back to in-person doctor visits, with an estimated annual loss of 12 million virtual appointments. This trend is reshaping the healthcare industry's approach to care delivery and the real estate strategies of medical practices, particularly in urban areas where the demand for accessible, high-quality medical office space is increasing.</p><p>Kurt Hackett, Vice President of Asset Management at Rethink Capital, points to the Medical Pavilion at 939 Ellis Street in San Francisco as a leading example of facilities designed to meet this growing need. Its location in the city's healthcare corridor and its modern design cater to the evolving requirements of healthcare providers and patients alike, emphasizing the importance of physical proximity to top-tier health systems.</p><p>Several factors are driving the preference for in-person care, including the clinical limitations of telehealth for certain conditions, shifts in insurance reimbursement policies, digital fatigue among patients, and the inherent value of face-to-face interactions between patients and providers. These dynamics are influencing investment trends in the medical real estate sector, with a focus on properties that can support the current and future needs of healthcare delivery.</p><p>As the industry continues to adapt to these changes, facilities like the Medical Pavilion at 939 Ellis Street are becoming increasingly vital. They represent a new chapter in healthcare that seeks to balance technological innovation with the essential benefits of in-person care, ensuring that patients have access to the best possible treatment options in settings designed to meet modern clinical standards.</p>
