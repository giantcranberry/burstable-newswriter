<p>The NAVEX 2025 Regional Whistleblowing & Incident Management Benchmark Report offers an in-depth look at the current state of internal reporting across the globe, analyzing over 2.15 million reports from more than 4,000 organizations. The findings reveal notable disparities in report volumes, with North American organizations receiving more than twice the reports compared to Europe and Asia Pacific (APAC), despite Europe experiencing the most significant increase in reporting levels to date.</p><p>Investigation and closure times for cases vary by region, with Europe and APAC taking longer than North America. However, the substantiation rates of cases remain high across all regions, with nearly half of all global reports being valid. This consistency underscores the reliability of whistleblowing reports as a tool for identifying misconduct.</p><p>Anonymous reporting rates are highest in South America, followed by APAC and Europe, suggesting concerns over retaliation may influence employees' willingness to report misconduct openly. The substantiation rates for retaliation cases, particularly in Europe where they are nearly double those in North America, highlight the urgent need for effective whistleblower protection mechanisms.</p><p>The report also examines preferred reporting channels and differences by company ownership type, with privately owned companies showing higher substantiation rates than publicly traded ones. Carrie Penman, Chief Risk and Compliance Officer at NAVEX, stresses the role of trusted reporting channels in mitigating risks before they escalate into larger liabilities.</p><p>These findings not only provide a snapshot of global whistleblowing trends but also serve as a critical resource for organizations looking to enhance their internal reporting systems. By addressing the identified disparities and challenges, companies can foster a culture of transparency and accountability, ultimately safeguarding their operations and reputation.</p>
