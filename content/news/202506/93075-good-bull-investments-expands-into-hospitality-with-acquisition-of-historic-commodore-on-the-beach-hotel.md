The hotel, located at 3618 Seawall Blvd. in Galveston, is a 92-room mid-century property that Good Bull Investments plans to renovate and reopen by Mardi Gras 2026. This acquisition represents a significant step for Good Bull Investments as it diversifies its portfolio beyond private equity and real estate into the hospitality sector.</p><p>The sale of the Commodore Hotel aligns with JMK5 Holdings' strategic pivot towards marquee redevelopment projects.
