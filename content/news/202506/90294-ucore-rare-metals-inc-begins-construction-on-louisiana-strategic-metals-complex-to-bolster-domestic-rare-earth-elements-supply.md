<p>Ucore Rare Metals Inc. (TSX.V: UCU) (OTCQX: UURAF) has initiated the construction of its Louisiana Strategic Metals Complex (SMC) in Alexandria, a move poised to significantly contribute to the establishment of a domestic supply chain for rare earth elements (REEs). This development is critical for North America, aiming to diminish reliance on foreign sources of these vital minerals, which are indispensable for various high-tech and defense applications.</p><p>The Louisiana SMC will utilize Ucore's proprietary RapidSX(TM) technology, designed to offer a more efficient and environmentally sustainable method for REE separation. This innovation represents a leap forward in the processing of critical metals, addressing both the environmental concerns associated with traditional methods and the strategic imperative of securing a domestic supply of REEs.</p><p>Supporting this initiative, the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) has contributed $18.4 million in funding, highlighting the project's national security implications and the broader importance of developing a secure and sustainable REE supply chain within the United States. The Louisiana SMC is anticipated to be Ucore's inaugural commercial REE refining operation, signifying a major milestone in the company's efforts to revolutionize the critical metals industry.</p><p>For further details on Ucore's innovative technology and the Louisiana SMC project, interested parties can visit <a href='https://ibn.fm/zPMiw' rel='nofollow' target='_blank'>https://ibn.fm/zPMiw</a> and <a href='https://ibn.fm/DbX2R' rel='nofollow' target='_blank'>https://ibn.fm/DbX2R</a>.</p>
