<p>A recent survey conducted by Consolidated Credit has brought to light the complex relationship between Hispanic families and credit card usage, revealing a significant financial literacy gap that poses a risk to household stability. With over 90% of Hispanic participants reporting ownership of at least one credit card, the survey underscores a troubling trend towards over-indebtedness, fueled by easy access to credit and a lack of foundational financial knowledge.</p><p>The data shows that 42% of respondents hold between two and three credit cards, while 28% possess four to five, indicating a potential for financial instability. This situation is further exacerbated by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York's report that total credit card debt in the U.S. soared to $1.18 trillion in the first quarter of 2025, highlighting a nationwide challenge of managing credit responsibly.</p><p>Financial education emerges as a critical need, with 61% of survey participants admitting they only learned to manage credit cards after incurring debt. The repercussions of this gap are severe, with 51% of respondents feeling that credit card use has adversely affected their finances, and 14% expressing regret over their credit card usage. For 8%, the consequences of misuse have been life-altering.</p><p>Despite these challenges, the survey also identifies what Hispanic consumers prioritize in credit cards: low or 0% interest rates for several months (72%), no annual fees (64%), rewards and travel miles (54%), and no international fees (18%). However, the misuse of credit, such as exceeding 30% of available credit, can significantly harm credit scores, restricting access to vital services like loans, housing, and employment opportunities.</p><p>Consolidated Credit advocates for the responsible use of credit cards, offering free financial education, personalized counseling, and debt management programs to help families achieve financial stability. This initiative is particularly vital for the Hispanic community, addressing the underlying issues of credit card misuse and providing practical solutions to avert financial distress.</p>
