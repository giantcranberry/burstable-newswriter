<p>LaFleur Minerals Inc. (CSE: LFLR) (OTCQB: LFLRF) has made a significant move in Quebec’s Abitibi Gold Belt by acquiring the Beacon Gold Mill for C$1 million (US$ 0.73 million) from Monarch Mining following its bankruptcy. This acquisition is seen as a bargain, considering the over C$20 million previously invested in the mill's upgrades, and positions LaFleur to capitalize on the increasing demand for milling services in the region, driven by the current high price of gold.</p><p>The Beacon Mill, situated in Val-d’Or, Quebec, is a fully permitted and refurbished facility that provides an immediate solution for gold processing in the Abitibi Gold Belt. This area is renowned for its abundant gold deposits and has experienced a surge in mining activity as companies aim to leverage the soaring gold prices. By acquiring the mill, LaFleur bypasses the usual 3–5 years needed for permitting and the substantial US$80–100 million investment required to construct a new facility, thereby gaining a significant market advantage.</p><p>Beyond the Beacon Mill, LaFleur holds the Swanson Gold Project, located merely 50 km away, which it intends to develop for its mining operations. The company is already drawing attention from potential investors for its milling services and gold project development plans, with the goal of generating near-term revenue through custom milling services and production from its gold project. This strategic acquisition not only strengthens LaFleur’s standing in the gold mining industry but also plays a vital role in bolstering the local economy by facilitating mining operations in the Abitibi Gold Belt.</p>
