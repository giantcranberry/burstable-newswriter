<p>Alsco Uniforms, a global leader in uniform and linen laundry services, has recently acquired Topper Linen, marking a significant expansion of its operational footprint in the Greater Toronto Area. This strategic move not only bolsters Alsco's service offerings but also highlights its dedication to fostering long-term community relationships, as noted by Bob Steiner, CEO of Alsco Uniforms.</p><p>The transition of Topper's Toronto facility and fleet to the Alsco Uniforms brand is set to occur over the next few months, with assurances that current operations and employment will remain unaffected. This approach ensures uninterrupted service and capitalizes on local expertise, a priority for Alsco's leadership. The acquisition increases Alsco's presence in Toronto to two laundry facilities, significantly enhancing its capacity to serve a broad spectrum of industries, including industrial, healthcare, hospitality, and food and beverage sectors.</p><p>Jim Kearns, Alsco's chief operating officer, views this acquisition as a pivotal step towards future expansion in the Toronto region, with additional investments planned for sales and service teams across North America. Operating over 80 mixed-processing facilities in North America, Alsco Uniforms continues to strengthen its reputation as a premier provider of hygienically clean uniforms, linens, and essential business supplies.</p>
