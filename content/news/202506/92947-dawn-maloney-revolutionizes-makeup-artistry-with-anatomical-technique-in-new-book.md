Maloney's methodology, refined through her work on prominent television shows such as The Maury Povich Show and The Sally Jesse Raphael Show, outlines consistent anatomical patterns that demand specific techniques for achieving symmetry and a natural appearance.</p><p>THE MAKEUP ARTIST’S DESIGN BOOK comprehensively covers 32 eye shapes, 36 lip shapes, and 50 face shapes, detailing 57,600 possible combinations. It utilizes hand-drawn illustrations and in-depth descriptions to help readers identify their unique features and apply makeup techniques that complement their natural structure. Maloney advocates for a focus on facial proportions rather than transient trends, ensuring consistently beautiful results across diverse faces.</p><p>In addition to the facial shape identification system, the book is packed with professional application tips, product suggestions, and 50 face-coloring charts, positioning it as an essential tool for makeup artists and aficionados.
