<p>Mullen Automotive Inc. (NASDAQ: MULN), a prominent electric vehicle (EV) manufacturer, has taken a pioneering step by announcing the acceptance of cryptocurrency payments for its commercial EVs. This includes well-known digital currencies like Bitcoin and the $TRUMP meme coin, positioning Mullen among the select few automakers to embrace such payment methods. The initiative is designed to make its U.S. safety- and emissions-certified EV lineup more accessible to a broader audience, with the company also exploring the addition of other meme and stablecoins to its payment options.</p><p>The EV models eligible for purchase with cryptocurrency encompass the Mullen ONE van, Mullen THREE truck, and the Bollinger B4 chassis cab. Notably, the Bollinger B4 offers a 185-mile range and a substantial 7,325-pound payload capacity. This strategic move not only diversifies the payment avenues available to customers but also reflects the increasing integration of cryptocurrency across various industries.</p><p>This development comes as Mullen Automotive continues to expand its commercial dealer network and bolster its manufacturing infrastructure. The company has recently secured IRS approval for federal EV tax credits and CARB-issued HVIP approval for its Mullen THREE, Class 3 EV truck, further cementing its standing in the competitive EV market.
