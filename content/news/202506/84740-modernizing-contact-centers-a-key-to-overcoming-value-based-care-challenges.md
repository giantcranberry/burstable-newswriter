<p>The shift towards value-based care (VBC) is reshaping the healthcare industry, but not without its hurdles. Financial risks and the scarcity of actionable data are among the top concerns deterring providers from fully embracing VBC models. Patty Hayward, General Manager of Healthcare and Life Sciences at Talkdesk, offers a compelling perspective on how modernizing contact centers can turn these challenges into opportunities for enhancing patient care and operational performance.</p><p>Financial risk looms large for providers considering VBC, with the fear of penalties or the need to repay insurers for underperformance acting as significant barriers. Compounding this issue is the lack of real-time, actionable data that could help providers identify and address care gaps during patient interactions. Hayward points to the untapped potential of contact centers, traditionally seen as cost centers, which can now play a pivotal role in bridging these gaps through the use of AI-enabled platforms.</p><p>These advanced platforms can identify care gaps in real time, even during routine calls, transforming every patient interaction into an opportunity for improved outcomes. This capability is crucial for meeting the benchmarks set by value-based contracts, thereby mitigating financial risks and enhancing patient care. Moreover, the integration of these solutions with existing Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems and workflows ensures a seamless transition, minimizing disruption and the learning curve for staff.</p><p>Automation and self-service features further bolster efficiency by taking over routine tasks, freeing up agents to focus on more complex patient needs. The long-term benefits of such transformations are manifold, including proactive care coordination, reduced operational costs, and the potential to unlock additional revenue by meeting VBC benchmarks. Ultimately, modernizing contact centers with purpose-built healthcare customer experience solutions represents a strategic move towards more personalized, accessible, and efficient care delivery, underscoring the critical role of technology in the future of healthcare.</p>
