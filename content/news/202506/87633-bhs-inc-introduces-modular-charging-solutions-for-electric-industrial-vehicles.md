<p>BHS, Inc. has recently introduced a new line of modular charging solutions aimed at electric industrial vehicles, a move that responds to the increasing demand for flexible infrastructure as companies shift towards electric fleets. The product lineup includes the Universal Forklift Charger Stand (CSU), Cable Retractor Reel Mounts (CSU-PX), and Cable Retractor Reels (CRR), offering businesses the ability to tailor their charging stations to specific operational needs.</p><p>Trent Boothe, Inside Sales Manager at BHS, highlighted the significance of adaptable charging solutions in today's rapidly evolving industrial landscape. 'As electric fleets expand, so does the need for charging infrastructure that can grow and adapt. A universal solution isn't always feasible,' Boothe remarked. The Universal Forklift Charger Stands are engineered to accommodate battery chargers of nearly any design, with the capacity to charge multiple industrial vehicles at once, including forklifts and automated guided vehicles.</p><p>The modular approach also encompasses cable management, with Cable Retractor Reel Mounts equipped with articulating arms for secure cable guidance to any charging point. The inclusion of Cable Retractor Reels rounds out an automated cable management system, designed to handle cables of diverse sizes and weights. These products are now available, underscoring BHS's dedication to facilitating electrification in sectors such as warehousing, logistics, air travel, and manufacturing.
