<p>Direxion has expanded its investment offerings with the launch of four new Single Stock Daily Leveraged & Inverse ETFs, specifically targeting Cisco Systems, Inc. (CSCO) and QUALCOMM Incorporated (QCOM). These new funds include the Direxion Daily CSCO Bull 2X ETF (CSCL), Direxion Daily CSCO Bear 1X ETF (CSCS), Direxion Daily QCOM Bull 2X ETF (QCMU), and Direxion Daily QCOM Bear 1X ETF (QCMD). Designed with the active trader in mind, these ETFs aim to provide opportunities to leverage short-term price movements in these leading technology stocks.</p><p>Douglas Yones, CEO of Direxion, highlighted the pivotal roles that Cisco and Qualcomm play in the digital economy, noting that these ETFs are crafted to offer traders dynamic tools for market engagement. However, Yones also cautioned that these products are intended for experienced traders who possess a high tolerance for risk. Unlike traditional ETFs that track diversified indices, these funds focus on single stocks, which can significantly amplify both potential returns and losses.</p><p>It's important for potential investors to understand that these ETFs are not designed for long-term investment strategies. Their daily leveraged and inverse objectives necessitate active management and carry substantial risks, including the potential for investors to lose their entire investment in a single day. Direxion strongly advises that individuals fully comprehend these risks before engaging with these products.</p><p>For those seeking more in-depth information regarding the risks and operational mechanics of these ETFs, Direxion recommends visiting their <a href="https://www.direxion.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Leveraged and Inverse ETF Education Center</a>.</p>
