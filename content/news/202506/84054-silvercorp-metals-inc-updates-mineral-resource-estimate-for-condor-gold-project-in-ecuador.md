The report not only provides a comprehensive overview of the project's current resource base but also sets the stage for future development plans.</p><p>The Condor gold project is a cornerstone of Silvercorp's portfolio, and this updated estimate serves as a critical tool for investors and industry observers. The involvement of SRK Consulting, a leader in mining and natural resource consulting, lends additional weight to the findings, ensuring that the data is both reliable and indicative of the project's potential.
