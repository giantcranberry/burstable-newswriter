<p>EnSilica PLC (AIM: ENSI) has showcased its resilience and strategic growth potential in its mid-year update for the first half of 2025, as highlighted by Stonegate Capital Partners. Specializing in mixed-signal ASICs for sectors including automotive, industrial, healthcare, and satellite connectivity, EnSilica is reinforcing its market stance. The company currently has five ASICs in production and twelve in the design phase, moving towards a more predictable revenue model. This progress is further underscored by a substantial royalty agreement valued at approximately US$28.0M with a satellite service provider.</p><p>Despite a 3% revenue decline to £9.3M compared to the previous year, attributed to the slower pace of new contract acquisitions, EnSilica experienced a remarkable 170.3% year-over-year growth in product supply revenue, reaching £2.9M. This growth highlights the company's successful pivot towards more stable income sources. Although EBITDA fell to £(0.2)M from £0.5M, due to investments aimed at scaling operations, the management team remains confident in achieving a positive full-year EBITDA by FY25.</p><p>Looking ahead, EnSilica's projections for FY25 and FY26 are optimistic, with anticipated revenues of £19.0M to £20.0M and £33.0M to £35.0M, respectively. A robust order backlog, representing 80% of FY26's expected revenues, lays a solid foundation for future growth. Recent milestones, such as a Memorandum of Understanding with a leading European satellite operator and the launch of two chips for the satellite broadband market, further cement EnSilica's strategic position in a sector projected to grow at a CAGR of 21.4% until 2033.</p><p>Stonegate Capital Partners' valuation of EnSilica, utilizing P/E, DCF, and EV/EBITDA methodologies, points to a promising mid-point valuation of £0.83. This reflects a strong belief in the company's growth path and its potential to capitalize on market opportunities, signaling a bright future for EnSilica in the evolving technology and business landscape.</p>
