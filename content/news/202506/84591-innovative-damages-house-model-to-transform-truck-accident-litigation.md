This innovative model, set to be unveiled at the 'Winning Truck Wreck Cases' seminar, aims to simplify the complex nature of intangible damages for judges, jurors, and clients alike. By associating these damages with the rooms of a house, the model leverages storytelling and visualization to make the abstract more tangible and impactful.</p><p>Scheduled for August 4, 2025, at the Embassy Suites Noblesville Indianapolis Conference Center, the seminar promises to be a pivotal event for legal professionals.

The model's potential to influence verdicts and settlements could mark a turning point in how damages are assessed and awarded in the industry.</p><p>Beyond her legal innovations, Childers' role as a co-founder of the Sisterhood of the 8 highlights her commitment to empowering women in the trucking and transportation legal sector. This non-profit organization not only advocates for safer roads but also aims to elevate women trial lawyers to achieve 8-figure verdicts, showcasing the intersection of legal excellence and gender equality in the profession.</p><p>The 'Winning Truck Wreck Cases' seminar, organized by David W. Craig and Scott A. Faultless, stands as a testament to the evolving nature of truck accident litigation.
