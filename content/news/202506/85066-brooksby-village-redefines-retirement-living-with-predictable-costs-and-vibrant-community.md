Brooksby Village, a senior living community, addresses these concerns head-on with a model that combines predictable monthly costs with a vibrant, engaging lifestyle. This approach has resonated with residents like Barbara Hooper, who, along with her late husband Bill, found in Brooksby Village a solution to the financial and social uncertainties of retirement.</p><p>The community's monthly service package is comprehensive, covering maintenance, utilities, meals at on-site restaurants, access to amenities, and scheduled transportation. This all-inclusive model eliminates the unpredictability of homeownership expenses, a feature that, according to a survey by Erickson Senior Living, over 90% of seniors prefer. The financial model is further enhanced by a 90% refundable entrance fee, making it accessible to a broader range of budgets.</p><p>Executive Director Tracie Bettano emphasizes the value residents derive from the variety of residence options and the wealth of amenities and activities available.
