<p>Platinum Group Metals Ltd. (NYSE American: PLG) (TSX: PTM) is making strategic moves to capitalize on the current surge in platinum group metals (PGM) prices, driven by renewed demand from China's jewelry sector and global supply constraints. The company's focus on the Waterberg Project in South Africa, a palladium-dominant deposit, positions it as a significant player in the PGM market. With a 50.16% interest in the project, alongside partners Impala Platinum Holdings Limited, Hanwa Co. Ltd., and the Japan Organization for Metals and Energy Security, Platinum Group Metals is poised to benefit from the favorable market conditions.</p><p>The Waterberg Project, situated on the Northern Limb of South Africa's Bushveld Igneous Complex, is a cornerstone of the company's strategy to enhance its supply capabilities in the PGM market.

This development is not only significant for the company but also for the broader PGM industry, as it underscores the importance of strategic investments in mining projects to meet global demand.</p><p>For more information on Platinum Group Metals Ltd. and its Waterberg Project, visit <a href='https://ibn.fm/kZQqP' rel='nofollow' target='_blank'>https://ibn.fm/kZQqP</a>.
