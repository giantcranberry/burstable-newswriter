<p>LaFleur Minerals Inc. (CSE: LFLR) (OTCQB: LFLRF) (FSE: 3WK0) is nearing gold production in Québec's Abitibi Gold Belt, a move that could significantly impact the mining sector and investors. The company's strategy centers on the utilization of its fully permitted Beacon Gold Mill and the wholly owned Swanson Gold Project to kickstart production in the near term. With gold prices soaring above US$3,300 per ounce, LaFleur has outlined plans to restart its 750 tonnes per day mill by late 2025, targeting cash flow generation through bulk sampling and custom milling.</p><p>The Swanson Gold Project, spanning an impressive 16,600 hectares, is not only rich in gold but also in critical metals, providing LaFleur with a vertically integrated pathway to growth. The company boasts a compliant gold resource of over 187,000 ounces, with the ambitious goal of achieving full-scale production of up to 30,000 ounces annually by early 2026. This strategic development positions LaFleur as an emerging force in one of Canada's most esteemed mining districts, offering the potential for sustained value creation in a Tier 1 mining jurisdiction.</p><p>For more information on LaFleur Minerals Inc.'s advancements and strategic initiatives, visit <a href='https://ibn.fm/mMIum' rel='nofollow' target='_blank'>https://ibn.fm/mMIum</a>.</p>
