<p>YieldClub has unveiled a mobile application aimed at simplifying the process of earning high yields on cryptocurrency savings, offering users the potential to earn up to 12% Annual Percentage Yield (APY) on stablecoins. This development is supported by $2.5 million in pre-seed funding from prominent fintech and crypto investors, including Pharsalus, Flex Capital, The House Fund, and Superlayer, along with strategic angel investments from industry leaders.</p><p>Founded by CEO Mahesh Vellanki and CTO Michael Li, both with extensive experience in the consumer tech sector, YieldClub seeks to connect traditional finance with the high-reward potential of decentralized finance (DeFi). The app's non-custodial model ensures users maintain complete control over their funds, complemented by a user-friendly interface designed for easy navigation and social login onboarding.</p><p>The launch of YieldClub's app is timely, as more consumers look for alternatives to traditional low-interest savings accounts. Utilizing audited DeFi protocols such as Morpho, YieldClub offers a secure platform for generating yield on stablecoins, reducing the risk associated with the volatility of other cryptocurrencies. This feature is especially attractive in international markets like Brazil, where stablecoin usage is growing rapidly.</p><p>The $2.5 million in funding will facilitate the app's public launch, broaden its yield-generating capabilities, and strengthen partnerships to enable smooth cash-to-crypto conversions. Planned future enhancements include the release of a debit card for spending stablecoin balances while still earning yield and the exploration of tokenized stock offerings for users outside the United States.</p><p>YieldClub is currently available for preorder on the <a href='https://www.apple.com/app-store/' rel='nofollow' target='_blank'>Apple App Store</a>, with a full public launch set for June 23, 2025, on both Apple and Android platforms.</p>
