<p>ESGold Corp. (CSE: ESAU) (OTCQB: ESAUF) has announced a major expansion of its Montauban Project mine building, effectively doubling its size from 2,000 to 4,000 square feet. This strategic move is aimed at supporting the company's shift towards gold and silver production, with the expanded facility now including crew accommodations, control rooms, a secure lab, and an enlarged 'Gold Room' for dore storage. This expansion is a clear indicator of ESGold's commitment to scaling its operations and improving its production efficiency.</p><p>As the construction of the expanded facility moves forward, ESGold is also in the process of awaiting crucial lab results from railbed pre-concentrate samples. These results, along with an updated Preliminary Economic Assessment and final Ambient Noise Tomography imaging, are expected to play a key role in refining the company's scalable processing model. Such developments are essential for ESGold's plans for district-scale exploration and underscore the company's strategic approach to maximizing the potential of its Montauban property for sustainable resource recovery and exploration.</p><p>The Montauban property, situated 80 kilometers west of Quebec City, stands as a reflection of ESGold's commitment to responsible mining practices. By aligning near-term production objectives with the potential for uncovering district-scale discoveries, ESGold is establishing itself as a frontrunner in the realm of clean mining and exploration innovation.
