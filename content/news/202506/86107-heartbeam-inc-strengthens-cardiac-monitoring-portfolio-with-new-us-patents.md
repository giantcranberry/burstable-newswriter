<p>HeartBeam Inc. (NASDAQ: BEAT) has recently announced the issuance of two new U.S. patents, further solidifying its leadership in the development of cutting-edge cardiac monitoring technologies. These patents cover the company's compact, cable-free 3D ECG device and a sophisticated rhythm analysis algorithm designed to detect arrhythmias through continuous signal input. This development represents a pivotal step forward in the realm of remote cardiac diagnostics, offering the potential to revolutionize how heart conditions are monitored and diagnosed outside traditional medical facilities.</p><p>The 3D ECG device, a cornerstone of HeartBeam's technology portfolio, utilizes chest and finger electrodes to capture high-fidelity signals from three non-coplanar directions. This innovative approach enables on-demand symptom recording and the synthesis of 12-lead ECGs, providing physicians with detailed insights into a patient's cardiac health. Currently under FDA review, the device's software is supported by data from the VALID-ECG pivotal study, underscoring its potential to enhance diagnostic accuracy and patient care.</p><p>Complementing the 3D ECG device, HeartBeam's rhythm analysis algorithm is engineered to operate across various cardiac monitoring systems. It identifies abnormal rhythms and triggers targeted data collection, thereby improving diagnostic precision. With these technologies, HeartBeam is not only expanding its intellectual property portfolio but also paving the way for the integration of artificial intelligence to further refine diagnostic capabilities.</p><p>With a total of 20 issued patents and 34 additional filings, HeartBeam is at the forefront of digital cardiac care innovation. The company's commitment to transforming cardiac care through portable, actionable heart intelligence is evident in its strategic advancements. These developments hold significant implications for the healthcare industry, offering the promise of more accessible, efficient, and accurate cardiac diagnostics for patients worldwide.</p>
