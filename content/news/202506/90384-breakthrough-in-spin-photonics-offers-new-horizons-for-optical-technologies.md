<p>The field of spin photonics, which utilizes the spin and polarization properties of photons for advanced information processing, has encountered a major hurdle due to insufficient dispersion control. This limitation has restricted the bandwidth and integration levels achievable with current technologies. However, a team from the National Key Laboratory of Optical Field Manipulation Science and Technology, Institute of Optics and Electronics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, has introduced a groundbreaking solution. Their development of a folded-path metasurface platform enables independent dispersion and phase control of two opposite spin states, addressing a critical challenge in the field.</p><p>This innovation is significant because it overcomes the inability of current spin-decoupled metasurfaces to achieve broadband decoupling and higher integration levels. The new platform demonstrates unprecedented capabilities, including achromatic focusing, the achromatic photonic spin Hall effect, and the generation of spatiotemporal vector optical fields with a single metasurface. These achievements were made possible by modifying the equivalent path length through local interference at subwavelength scales, a departure from conventional techniques that rely on structural geometry modifications.</p><p>The implications of this research are profound, offering new possibilities for the dynamic control of light-matter interactions and the development of next-generation spin-photonic devices. The metasurface platform is expected to facilitate the creation of compact spin-multiplexing devices for applications in broadband polarization optics, information encoding, and spatiotemporal optical field manipulation. Supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China and the National Natural Science Foundation of China, this work highlights the transformative potential of spin photonics in revolutionizing optical technologies.</p><p>By addressing fundamental barriers, the folded-path metasurface platform opens up new avenues for innovation in industries dependent on optical information processing and transmission. This advancement not only marks a significant leap forward in spin photonics but also sets the stage for future developments that could redefine the capabilities of optical devices.</p>
