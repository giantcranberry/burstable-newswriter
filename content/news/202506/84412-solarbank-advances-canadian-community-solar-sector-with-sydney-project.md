<p>SolarBank Corporation has made significant strides in the renewable energy sector with its latest announcement regarding the 2.4 MW DC Sydney project in Nova Scotia. This project, developed in partnership with AI Renewable Flow-through Fund and Trimac Engineering, is a cornerstone in the company's expansion within the Canadian community solar market. With a valuation of $4.57 million, the Sydney project is poised to generate 2,730 MWh of clean energy each year, enough to power approximately 221 homes and reduce carbon emissions by 1,900 tons annually.</p><p>The construction of the Sydney project is set to begin in the spring of 2026, with SolarBank taking on the dual roles of developer and EPC contractor. This initiative not only promises to bring engineering revenues in the short term but also secures a long-term income stream through operations and maintenance contracts. The project is a testament to SolarBank's dedication to fostering sustainable energy solutions and aligns perfectly with Nova Scotia's goal of sourcing 80% of its energy from renewables by 2030.</p><p>Specializing in renewable and clean energy projects, SolarBank Corporation has a robust portfolio that spans solar, Battery Energy Storage System (BESS), and EV Charging projects across Canada and the USA. The company's efforts are directed towards serving a wide array of customers, including utilities, commercial, industrial, municipal, and residential sectors. With a development pipeline that exceeds one gigawatt and over 100 megawatts of built capacity, SolarBank is leading the charge in North America's transition to renewable energy.</p><p>The Sydney project underscores the critical role of community solar projects in advancing environmental sustainability and energy independence. Through strategic partnerships and the adoption of cutting-edge technologies, SolarBank is not only contributing to the reduction of carbon emissions but also setting a high standard for future renewable energy projects in the region and beyond. This initiative highlights the growing significance of community-based solar projects in the global push towards a cleaner, more sustainable energy future.</p>
