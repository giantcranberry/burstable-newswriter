<p>Splash Beverage Group, Inc. has announced a significant $20 million acquisition of exclusive water rights to a natural spring source located in Costa Rica's Blue Zone, an area renowned for its water purity and mineral richness. This strategic move includes the source of Blu, a premium water brand, and is poised to bolster Splash's portfolio with a scalable natural asset. The acquisition, financed through a new series of convertible preferred stock, highlights the company's dedication to high-margin beverage brands and sustainability.</p><p>William Meissner, President and Chief Marketing Officer of Splash Beverage Group, emphasized the acquisition's synergy with the growing global wellness movement and its capacity to enhance revenue streams. The natural spring will serve as the foundation for an expanded brand platform, featuring a super-premium glass bottle line and a sustainable canned water line, both produced with environmentally friendly methods. This initiative not only solidifies Splash's foothold in the premium water sector but also aligns with its strategy for long-term value creation.</p><p>The transaction is expected to be finalized by August 10, with a definitive deadline of December 31, 2025, for the rights transfer. Non-compliance with this timeline would obligate the seller to compensate Splash with $20 million or result in the preferred stock's cancellation. This acquisition underscores Splash Beverage Group's approach to harnessing unique natural resources for brand development and market penetration, reflecting a forward-thinking stance in the beverage industry.</p>
