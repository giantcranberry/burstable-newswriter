<p>Nicola Mining Inc. has announced the start of its 2025 diamond drilling campaign at the New Craigmont Copper Project near Merritt, British Columbia. This ambitious program aims to explore between 4,000 and 5,000 meters across five priority zones, including two new targets identified through a partnership with ALS Geoanalytics (GoldSpot Discoveries Ltd.), which employs artificial intelligence to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of exploration efforts.</p><p>With a budget ranging from $1.5 to $2 million, the campaign is focused on delineating porphyry-style copper mineralization and advancing exploration around key areas such as MARB, CAS, West Craigmont/WP, and the newly identified Draken prospect. The drilling is expected to continue through September, utilizing advanced data collection techniques like pXRF and SWIR to refine geological models and support future exploration strategies.</p><p>This initiative highlights Nicola Mining's dedication to integrating cutting-edge technology into mineral exploration. The application of AI to generate exploration targets represents a notable leap forward in the field, potentially increasing the likelihood of discovering new mineralization zones. Such advancements could set a new standard for exploration projects within the mining industry, demonstrating the transformative potential of technology in uncovering valuable resources.</p>
