<p>Lantern Pharma Inc. (NASDAQ: LTRN) has achieved a notable breakthrough in cancer treatment through its Phase 2 HARMONIC(TM) trial. A patient with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), who had previously undergone three unsuccessful treatments, including immunotherapy and targeted kinase inhibitors, achieved a complete response using LP-300. This compound was optimized using Lantern Pharma's AI-powered platform, RADR®. The patient's sustained remission, now lasting over two years, marks a significant milestone in the application of artificial intelligence in oncology.</p><p>The trial focuses on never-smokers with NSCLC, a demographic representing a growing global unmet need with an estimated annual market of over $4 billion. Lantern Pharma's innovative use of AI and machine learning in drug development not only accelerates the identification of effective treatments but also opens new avenues for personalized cancer therapy. The success of LP-300 in this context underscores the transformative potential of integrating technology and medicine, particularly for patient populations with limited treatment options.</p><p>For further details on Lantern Pharma's pioneering work in AI-driven oncology solutions, visit <a href='https://ibn.fm/II6O6' rel='nofollow' target='_blank'>https://ibn.fm/II6O6</a>.
