<p>SolarBank Corporation, a key player in the renewable energy sector, has announced the renewal of its at-the-market (ATM) equity program, a strategic move aimed at financing its ambitious clean energy projects. This initiative allows the company to issue up to US$15 million in common shares through designated agents, including H.C. Wainwright & Co., Research Capital Corporation, and Research Capital USA Inc. The shares will be sold at current market prices, with the proceeds earmarked for enhancing operations, funding capital programs, repaying debts, and pursuing potential acquisitions.</p><p>As an independent developer and owner of distributed and community solar projects across Canada and the USA, SolarBank is at the forefront of the transition to renewable energy. The company also focuses on Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) and EV Charging projects, catering to a wide array of customers from utilities to residential users. With a development pipeline exceeding one gigawatt and over 100 megawatts of projects already under its belt, SolarBank's renewed ATM program is a testament to its commitment to leading the charge in clean energy innovation.</p><p>The renewal of the ATM equity program is not just a financial strategy but a clear indicator of SolarBank's dedication to expanding its renewable energy portfolio. This move is expected to provide the necessary capital to accelerate project development, improve operational efficiencies, and seize new opportunities in the fast-evolving energy sector. For investors and industry stakeholders, this development underscores the growing importance of sustainable energy solutions and SolarBank's role in shaping the future of renewable energy in North America.</p>
