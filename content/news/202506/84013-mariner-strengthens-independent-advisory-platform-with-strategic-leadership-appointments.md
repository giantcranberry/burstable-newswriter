<p>Mariner, a prominent national financial services firm, is taking significant steps to reinforce its Mariner Independent platform through the appointment of key leaders, Rob Sandrew and Verne Marble. This strategic move is aimed at addressing the increasing demand among financial advisors for more flexible affiliation models and viable long-term monetization strategies. With over 1,100 advisors and approximately $40 billion in assets under management and advisement, Mariner Independent stands as a cornerstone of Mariner's expansion strategy.</p><p>Rob Sandrew, now the Head of Mariner Independent, brings a wealth of experience in operational and strategic leadership, previously driving substantial growth as chief growth officer at Integrated Partners. Verne Marble joins as Managing Director, offering deep expertise in distribution and leadership from leading financial services firms. Their appointments are timely, aligning with Mariner's period of significant growth, including the strategic acquisition of Ocean Heights Advisors, which provides advisors with succession solutions and monetization opportunities within a comprehensive W-2 structure.</p><p>This initiative not only offers advisors upfront cash and equity but also includes a three-year earnout based on operating margins, reflecting Mariner's dedication to fostering business autonomy and growth among its advisors. Marty Bicknell, CEO and president of Mariner, highlighted the platform's success in balancing independence with the support needed for advisors to scale their practices effectively.</p><p>Since its launch in 2020, Mariner Independent has provided a full spectrum of services, from back-office support to compliance resources, backed by a team of over 300 professionals. The addition of Sandrew and Marble to the Mariner Independent Executive Committee is a clear indication of Mariner's commitment to evolving the platform, ensuring it remains a top choice for independent advisors seeking growth and success in a competitive landscape.</p>
