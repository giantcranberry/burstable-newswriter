<p>UMAXX, a leader in privacy-first smartphones and secure communications, has publicly endorsed the Trump Organization's recent announcement of a new mobile phone initiative. This partnership underscores a mutual commitment to enhancing American digital sovereignty and reducing reliance on foreign technology. UMAXX's endorsement is significant, given its expertise in producing secure, U.S.-assembled smartphones, known as Liberty Phones, which offer hardware-level privacy protections.</p><p>Jim Devericks, CEO of SuperCloud International, UMAXX's parent company, praised the initiative for addressing the critical need to protect Americans from surveillance by Big Tech and for promoting domestic technology manufacturing. The Liberty Phones, launched in late 2024, are notable for their use of U.S.-sourced components and assembly, running on PureOS, an open-source operating system designed to eliminate hidden tracking and spyware. These features position the Liberty Phones as a leading choice for consumers prioritizing privacy and security.</p><p>The Liberty Plus model, in particular, exemplifies UMAXX's commitment to privacy and domestic manufacturing. Compatible with all major carriers, including UMAXX's secure 5G network and potentially the new Trump Mobile network, the Liberty Phones offer a comprehensive secure mobile solution. Additionally, each phone includes UMAXX's live TV service, providing over 350 HD channels, further enhancing its value proposition.</p><p>Devericks highlighted the challenges of developing a secure, American-made smartphone, a milestone UMAXX has achieved with its Liberty Phone platform. The company has engaged in preliminary discussions with the Trump Organization in 2024 and remains open to further collaboration. This initiative reflects a shared vision to redefine technology standards in the U.S., with a focus on privacy, security, and domestic manufacturing.</p><p>Liberty Phones are currently available for purchase, with subscription plans starting at $99 per month, offering unlimited talk, text, and data on UMAXX's secure 5G network. This collaboration between UMAXX and the Trump Organization represents a pivotal step towards achieving digital freedom for Americans, setting a new benchmark for privacy and security in the technology sector.</p>
