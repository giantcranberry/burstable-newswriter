<p>NOA Lithium Brines Inc. has made a pivotal discovery at its Rio Grande Project located in Argentina's Lithium Triangle, uncovering a fresh water source within the project's boundaries. This development is a game-changer for the lithium brine project, as access to industrial water is a critical challenge in the arid regions where lithium salars are found. The presence of an on-site water source not only mitigates a significant operational hurdle but also promises to reduce both capital and operating costs related to water procurement and transportation.</p><p>Gabriel Rubacha, CEO of NOA, emphasized the strategic value of this discovery, pointing out its proximity to areas with the highest lithium concentrations and the planned sites for production facilities and evaporation ponds. The water well, drilled to a depth of 190 meters in the northern section of the project, represents one of three identified fresh water targets, indicating potential for further expansion of water resources.</p><p>The Rio Grande Project is a key component of NOA's extensive land holdings in Salta Province, Argentina, a region renowned for its high-grade, low-cost lithium operations. With a preliminary economic assessment slated for Q3 2025, NOA is progressing towards an initial production capacity of about 20,000 metric tonnes per year of lithium carbonate equivalent, with plans to potentially double this capacity. This advancement is timely, as global lithium demand is experiencing unprecedented growth, fueled by the expanding electric vehicle market and the increasing need for energy storage solutions.</p><p>NOA's systematic strategy to mitigate risks and achieve critical development milestones highlights its potential to emerge as Argentina's next leading lithium producer. The discovery of fresh water at the Rio Grande Project represents a significant milestone in this endeavor, underscoring the project's enhanced feasibility and its contribution to addressing the world's surging lithium requirements.</p>
