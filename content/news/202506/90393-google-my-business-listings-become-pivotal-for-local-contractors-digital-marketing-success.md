<p>The digital marketing arena for local contractors has witnessed a notable shift in early 2025, with Google My Business (GMB) listings becoming a cornerstone for website traffic generation. Analysis by Blue Sky Advertisement, drawing on data from more than 40 contractor clients, indicates a dramatic increase in the proportion of clicks originating from GMB listings, from an average of 40% to frequently exceeding 60%, with some businesses reporting even higher figures.</p><p>This upward trend is illustrated by the experiences of various contractors across different regions and specialties. For example, an excavation company in Snohomish County, WA, observed its GMB-originated clicks jump from 37% to 54% within four months, while a demolition company in the same locale saw an increase from 31% to 58%. Likewise, a plumbing company in Washington and a remodeling company in Sacramento County, CA, reported their GMB clicks soaring to 61% and 59%, respectively.</p><p>The surge in GMB's importance is largely due to recent updates to Google's algorithm and the rollout of AI Mode and AI Overviews in local search results, which favor map pack listings and GMB profiles above traditional organic search outcomes. This development has significantly raised the stakes for businesses not featured in the map pack, as these listings now generate up to 80% of local service leads for certain contractors.</p><p>To stay ahead in this changing landscape, contractors are encouraged to ensure their GMB profiles are meticulously maintained with current and precise information, adopt robust local SEO practices, keep abreast of algorithm updates, and cultivate a positive online reputation. The transformation in digital marketing dynamics highlights the critical role of GMB profiles as the main avenue for lead generation in the local service sector.</p>
