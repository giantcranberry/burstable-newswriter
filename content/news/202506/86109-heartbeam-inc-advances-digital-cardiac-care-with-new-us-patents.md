<p>HeartBeam Inc. (NASDAQ: BEAT), a leader in digital cardiac care, has recently been granted two new U.S. patents, reinforcing its position in the development of remote cardiac diagnostics technologies. These patents encompass the company's compact, cable-free 3D ECG device and an advanced rhythm analysis algorithm, designed to detect arrhythmias through continuous signal input. This advancement is pivotal in enhancing the accessibility of advanced cardiac care beyond conventional medical settings.</p><p>The 3D ECG device, a key innovation by HeartBeam, employs chest and finger electrodes to capture high-quality cardiac signals from three non-coplanar directions. This method facilitates on-demand symptom recording and the creation of 12-lead ECGs, providing a detailed overview of the heart's electrical activity. Currently undergoing FDA review, the device's software has been validated by the VALID-ECG pivotal study, highlighting its potential to transform cardiac monitoring practices.</p><p>Accompanying the 3D ECG device, HeartBeam's rhythm analysis algorithm improves diagnostic accuracy by detecting abnormal heart rhythms and initiating focused data collection. This adaptable feature across various cardiac monitoring systems aims to enhance the precision of arrhythmia detection and treatment. Together, these technologies meet the urgent demand for portable, dependable cardiac diagnostics available anytime, anywhere.</p><p>With a strong portfolio of 20 issued patents and 34 pending applications, HeartBeam is leading the charge in digital cardiac care innovation. The company is also exploring the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) to further boost diagnostic accuracy, signaling a move towards more intelligent and responsive cardiac health management solutions. These innovations are expected to revolutionize cardiac care by facilitating early detection and intervention, thereby improving patient outcomes and alleviating pressure on healthcare systems.</p><p>HeartBeam's dedication to pioneering cardiac care is demonstrated by its development of the first cable-free 12-lead ECG device capable of three-dimensional heart signal capture. This platform technology aims to equip physicians with critical heart intelligence, enabling the identification of cardiac health trends and acute conditions outside traditional healthcare environments. Through these efforts, HeartBeam is establishing new benchmarks in patient care and diagnostic precision, reshaping the future of cardiac health management.</p>
