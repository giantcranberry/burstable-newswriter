<p>True Markets, a New York-based cryptocurrency startup, has successfully closed an $11 million Series A funding round, co-led by Accomplice and RRE Ventures, with participation from Reciprocal Ventures, Variant, and PayPal Ventures. This investment elevates the total funding to $20 million, underscoring the confidence in True Markets' vision to transform retail cryptocurrency trading. The startup, founded by former Coinbase executives Vishal K. Gupta and Patrick McCreary, leverages the Solana blockchain to offer a stablecoin-native DeFi trading experience through its newly launched app on Apple’s App Store.</p><p>The platform's non-custodial nature, which ensures client assets are not held by the company, addresses a critical risk in the cryptocurrency sector. By focusing on Solana-native assets and utilizing Turnkey’s secure key infrastructure, True Markets provides retail traders with low-cost, high-speed access to cryptocurrency trading, overcoming common challenges such as fragmented liquidity and unclear pricing. Bryce Ferguson of Turnkey highlighted the startup's innovative approach to merging security with simplicity, a combination that could redefine standards in the crypto space.</p><p>This funding and the launch of the True Markets app represent a pivotal moment for decentralized finance (DeFi), making it more accessible and user-friendly for retail traders. The involvement of notable investors and the expertise of its founders signal a strong potential for True Markets to influence the future of cryptocurrency trading, offering a glimpse into the evolving landscape of digital assets and blockchain technology.</p>
