<p>The U.S. housing market in 2025 is witnessing a pronounced slowdown, characterized by a 14.1% increase in homes listed for sale nationwide in May compared to earlier in the year, and a 17.8% rise from May 2024, reaching the highest inventory levels since the Great Recession. However, the pace at which homes are selling has decelerated, with more than half (53.5%) of homes selling below their asking price, according to Redfin. This trend is largely due to elevated mortgage rates and stretched affordability, which have significantly dampened buyer activity.</p><p>Elana Newman, co-founder of 3 Step Home Sale, highlights the difficulties sellers are currently facing, including increased competition, slower offer processes, and heightened uncertainty. In response, 3 Step Home Sale, specializing in as-is cash offers, has developed a proprietary 3-step process designed to streamline the selling experience. This process can generate a cash offer in as little as 30 minutes and facilitate closings in as few as 7 days, presenting a viable alternative to the conventional, often protracted home selling process.</p><p>To further support sellers, 3 Step Home Sale has launched the 7-Day Flex Stayâ„¢ program, enabling sellers to stay in their homes for up to one week post-closing. This program tackles the frequent challenge of delayed access to sale proceeds, offering families extra time to relocate without the pressure of an immediate move. The current dynamics of the U.S. housing market, coupled with innovative solutions such as those provided by 3 Step Home Sale, underscore the shifting landscape of challenges and opportunities within the sector.</p>
