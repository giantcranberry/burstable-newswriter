<p>UGI Utilities has initiated a significant infrastructure upgrade project in Union Township, including parts of Winfield, set to commence on June 23. This project is a critical step in UGI's ongoing efforts to enhance the safety and reliability of its natural gas distribution system. By replacing aging gas mains and service lines, UGI aims to reduce the risk of leaks and ensure a more dependable energy supply for its customers.</p><p>The upgrade will span several key areas, including Trutt Road between County Line Road and Felmey Road, Woodsedge Drive from Trutt Road to its cul-de-sac, and Felmey Road from Trutt Road to Amish Road. Additionally, service lines to properties on Felmey Road, Park Road, Shirley Drive, and Westbranch Highway will be replaced. This extensive work is expected to be completed by early September, weather permitting.</p><p>Residents and businesses in the affected areas should prepare for potential inconveniences, including road closures, detours, and temporary interruptions in natural gas service. UGI has outlined that construction will occur on weekdays from 7am to 5pm, with parking restrictions in place on the impacted streets. The company also emphasizes the importance of property access for safety inspections and service restoration following the upgrades.</p><p>This project not only underscores UGI's commitment to infrastructure modernization but also offers an opportunity for some customers to transition to natural gas, a cleaner and more efficient energy source. With over 760,000 customers relying on its services, UGI's investment in upgrading its distribution network is a testament to the growing demand for reliable and safe energy solutions. The completion of this project will mark a significant milestone in UGI's mission to meet the evolving needs of its customers and the communities it serves.</p>
