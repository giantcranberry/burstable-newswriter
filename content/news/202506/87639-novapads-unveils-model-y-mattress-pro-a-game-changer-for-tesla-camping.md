This product is engineered to transform the car's trunk into a comfortable sleeping area, rivaling the comfort of a home bed.</p><p>The development of the Model Y Mattress Pro was driven by a Tesla enthusiast's pursuit of the ultimate camping mattress. By employing advanced 3D scanning technology, the mattress guarantees a perfect fit within the Model Y's trunk, optimizing space to accommodate two adults comfortably. The innovative Air-Foam structural design merges the plushness of memory foam with the space-saving advantages of air mattresses. This design includes high-pressure air chambers and a 4.5-inch high-resilience foam layer, ensuring a level and restful sleeping surface.</p><p>Ease of use is a hallmark of the Model Y Mattress Pro, featuring a built-in compression pump for rapid setup and storage. The mattress can be ready for use in about 50 seconds and packed away in just 60 seconds, catering to the needs of adventurers seeking impromptu camping experiences. It also boasts odor-free TPU material for user safety, strategically placed grooves to prevent obstruction of rear AC vents and the touchscreen, and comes with a complimentary removable bed sheet for hygiene.</p><p>The NovaPads team emphasizes their mission to elevate Tesla camping to the comfort level of home sleeping. The Model Y Mattress Pro is a key addition to NovaPads' lineup of Tesla camping accessories, all aimed at improving the convenience and comfort for Tesla owners during their travels.</p>
