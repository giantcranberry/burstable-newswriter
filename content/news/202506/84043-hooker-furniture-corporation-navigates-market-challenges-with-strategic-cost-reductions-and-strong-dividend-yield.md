<p>Hooker Furniture Corporation (NASDAQ: HOFT) has disclosed its first-quarter fiscal year 2026 financial results, showcasing a revenue of $85.3 million and an operating income of ($3.6) million, with adjusted earnings per share (EPS) at ($0.29). These figures, slightly below consensus estimates, reflect an 8.8% year-over-year revenue decline, primarily due to reduced volumes and the adverse effects of tariffs on the HMI segment. Despite these hurdles, the company achieved a consolidated gross profit margin (GPM) of 22.3%, indicating a 173 basis points increase from the previous quarter.</p><p>The furniture retail sector continues to face significant macroeconomic challenges, including volatile interest rates, a persistent housing shortage, and elevated home prices, all contributing to an extended downturn. In response, Hooker Furniture Corporation is concentrating on controllable factors to steer through these turbulent times. A notable achievement is the company's success in reducing fixed costs by 25%, or approximately $25.0 million, with full realization anticipated by fiscal year 2027.</p><p>On the capital allocation front, HOFT remains steadfast in its commitment to shareholders, distributing a dividend of $0.23 per share, which annualizes to $0.92 per share, yielding an 8.1% dividend yield. The quarter concluded with $18.0 million in cash, and the company has since cleared all outstanding borrowings on its revolving credit facility, leaving it with about $3.0 million in cash and $63.3 million in borrowing capacity.</p><p>Inventory management has been a pivotal area of focus for HOFT, with strategic adjustments made to bolster the balance sheet and inventory position over the past year. The company's adaptive inventory strategy, including a new Vietnam warehouse, has significantly reduced lead times, enabling less security stock and delaying the need for substantial restocking.</p><p>With a reported backlog of approximately $51.2 million, slightly down from $52.6 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2025, HOFT attributes the reduction to strong throughput. Despite current macroeconomic uncertainties, the company's operational adjustments and supply chain efficiencies are poised to offer a competitive edge once the market stabilizes.</p><p>Valuation analyses, including Dividend Discount Model, DCF Model, and EV/EBIT comp analysis, suggest a valuation range for HOFT with mid-points around $15.95, $15.98, and $13.53, respectively. Hooker Furniture Corporation's strategic initiatives, coupled with its robust dividend yield, underscore its resilience and potential in the face of ongoing market challenges.</p>
