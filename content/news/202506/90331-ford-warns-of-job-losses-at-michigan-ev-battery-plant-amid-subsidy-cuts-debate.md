<p>Ford Motor has raised concerns over possible job reductions at its electric vehicle (EV) battery facility in Michigan, contingent on the US Congress's decision to diminish current subsidies for clean energy manufacturers. The Michigan plant, slated for operation next year, is projected to create 1,700 jobs. This development emerges amidst congressional budget talks that may roll back incentives crucial for the clean energy industry, potentially jeopardizing Ford's and other companies' positions and undermining the US's competitiveness against China in the EV sector.</p><p>The potential policy shift carries implications not just for Ford but for the entire US battery manufacturing landscape and its standing on the global stage. Entities such as Platinum Group Metals Ltd., which have expressed investment interest in the US battery domain, could encounter similar hurdles. This scenario illustrates the intricate interplay between fiscal decisions and the expansion of the clean energy sector, pointing to possible adverse effects on employment and innovation within the industry.</p>
