The partnership aims to streamline the process for business banking sales teams, allowing them to leverage real-time, actionable insights during customer conversations.</p><p>The integration utilizes Vertical IQ's vast coverage, which includes over 97% of the economic revenue in the U.S. and Canada, featuring more than 920 Industry Profiles and 3,400 local economic reports. This wealth of data is now dynamically applied within the Ignite platform, providing frontline bankers with immediate access to critical industry trends and benchmarks. Such accessibility is expected to enhance the quality of customer interactions, leading to more informed discussions and stronger relationships.</p><p>Paul Hock, VP of Sales and Strategic Partnerships at Vertical IQ, and Ken Patrick, Chief Growth Officer of Ignite Sales, both underscored the partnership's potential to empower bankers with timely insights. This initiative reflects the financial sector's increasing demand for solutions that combine efficiency with personalized customer service.
