<p>Lantern Pharma Inc. (NASDAQ: LTRN), a clinical-stage biotechnology company, is pioneering the use of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning in oncology drug development. Its proprietary RADR(R) platform, which harnesses over 200 billion oncology-specific data points, is setting new standards in the field. This innovative approach not only accelerates the drug development process but also drastically cuts the associated costs, marking a significant leap forward in the fight against cancer.</p><p>Currently, Lantern Pharma has three lead drug candidates in clinical development, focusing on non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), and non-Hodgkinâ€™s lymphoma (NHL). The company's Starlight Therapeutics initiative is expanding its research into brain and central nervous system (CNS) cancers, including pediatric cases, with support from FDA orphan and rare disease designations.</p><p>The FDA has acknowledged the potential of Lantern Pharma's pipeline by awarding it multiple designations, such as Fast Track, Orphan Drug, and Rare Pediatric Disease status. These accolades not only highlight the significance of Lantern's contributions but also streamline the regulatory process for its therapies. Remarkably, the company has demonstrated the ability to progress drug programs from AI-driven insights to first-in-human clinical trials in just 2-3 years, with an average cost of $2.5 million per program. This efficiency underscores the transformative potential of AI in oncology drug development.</p><p>For further details on Lantern Pharma's innovative efforts, visit <a href='https://ibn.fm/s1B45' rel='nofollow' target='_blank'>https://ibn.fm/s1B45</a>.</p>
