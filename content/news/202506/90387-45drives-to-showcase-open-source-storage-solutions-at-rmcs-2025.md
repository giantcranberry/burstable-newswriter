<p>45Drives, a prominent provider of high-performance open-source storage and virtualization infrastructure, is poised to play a pivotal role at the 2025 Rocky Mountain CyberSecurity Symposium (RMCS). The event, taking place from June 16â€“20 at Casper College in Casper, Wyoming, serves as a key forum for cybersecurity experts, educators, and technologists. The participation of 45Drives highlights the growing significance of open-source solutions in crafting secure and durable data environments.</p><p>Mitch Hall, Chief Architect at 45Drives, is scheduled to present a session named 'Designing Resilient Open-Source Storage Architectures for Security-Conscious Organizations.' This session will explore the integration of open-source technologies such as Ceph, ZFS, and 45Drives' proprietary software to establish secure data infrastructures. The presentation is designed to illustrate how these technologies can assist organizations in minimizing vulnerabilities, evading vendor lock-in, and preserving data sovereignty.</p><p>Subsequent to the presentation, Hall will host an interactive workshop featuring live demonstrations of Proxmox VE on the Proxinator VM8 storage server. Attendees will gain hands-on experience with scalable virtualization infrastructure and insights into software-defined networking and security via OPNsense. The workshop will also highlight SnapShield, 45Drives' anti-ransomware software, offering a real-world perspective on ransomware detection and mitigation.</p><p>Dr. Doug Milburn, President of 45Drives, stressed the critical nature of infrastructure choices in cybersecurity, promoting the use of open-source solutions that provide control, customization, and cost-effectiveness. He pointed out the dangers linked to proprietary, cloud-based services, which frequently hide vulnerabilities, and advocated for transparency as a cybersecurity asset.</p><p>The RMCS 2025 is anticipated to draw hundreds of professionals from diverse industries, serving as a venue for sharing knowledge and enhancing skills in cybersecurity. 45Drives' engagement in the symposium underscores its dedication to fostering secure, transparent, and community-oriented data infrastructure solutions. The company's pioneering products, including the Storinator and Stornado, exemplify its leadership in delivering cost-effective, high-performance alternatives to conventional enterprise storage systems.</p>
