<p>The International Council of Shopping Centers (ICSC) has announced a key leadership transition with the promotion of Moutray McLaren to the position of Executive Vice President, Public Policy. This strategic move follows the retirement of Betsy Laird, a veteran in ICSC's government relations, who has significantly influenced the organization's public policy achievements over her 22-year tenure. McLaren's promotion is seen as a pivotal step for ICSC as it seeks to navigate the complexities of current legislative priorities affecting the commercial real estate and retail sectors.</p><p>McLaren's extensive experience and proven leadership in public policy, including his previous role as Senior Vice President, Public Policy at ICSC, position him as a formidable advocate for the organization's members. His background, which includes serving as Chief of Staff to United States Rep. William Timmons and roles within the Office of Management & Budget, equips him with the necessary expertise and relationships to advance ICSC's agenda on Capitol Hill. Tom McGee, President and CEO of ICSC, commended McLaren's dedication and his ability to effectively represent the interests of the commercial real estate and retail industries in Washington.</p><p>The timing of McLaren's promotion is critical, as ICSC aims to influence ongoing tax policy discussions and address challenges such as Organized Retail Crime. His leadership is expected to reinforce ICSC's role as a leading voice in public policy, building on the legacy left by Laird. Under her guidance, ICSC has achieved significant policy victories that have benefited the industry, setting a strong foundation for McLaren's future efforts.</p><p>This leadership change highlights ICSC's commitment to advocating for policies that support the growth and stability of the commercial real estate and retail industries. By ensuring these sectors' contributions to vibrant communities and economies are recognized at the highest levels of government, ICSC under McLaren's leadership is poised to tackle the evolving challenges and opportunities in the political landscape.</p>
