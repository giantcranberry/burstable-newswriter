<p>Cboe Global Markets, Inc. has introduced Options on Cboe Volatility Index Futures (VX Options), a new financial product designed to offer traders more sophisticated tools for expressing directional views and managing exposure to equity market volatility. This launch aligns with the growing interest in options trading, as evidenced by the Options Clearing Corporation's report of U.S. options volumes surpassing 11 billion contracts in 2023, a 126% increase since 2019.</p><p>The VX Options are European-style, physically settled options with PM settlement, based on VX futures that trade on the Cboe Futures Exchange. They provide a unique payout profile in the exchange-traded derivatives space, enabling investors to take short-term views on forward volatility movements. This feature not only enhances market liquidity but also allows for more precise delta management through settlement into the front-month VIX futures contract for in-the-money options.</p><p>Catherine Clay, Global Head of Derivatives at Cboe, highlighted the product's significance in meeting customer demand for efficient and seamless trading experiences. The launch is part of Cboe's strategy to expand its volatility product suite, complementing innovations like the Cboe S&P 500 Variance futures, and aims to equip investors with advanced tools for navigating market uncertainty, such as during election seasons.</p><p>To aid traders in leveraging these new products, Cboe provides educational resources through its Options Institute, which offers free online courses, webinars, and expert insights. The introduction of VX Options marks a pivotal advancement in the financial derivatives market, promising to bolster portfolio management and risk mitigation strategies as investors increasingly adopt sophisticated trading instruments.</p>
