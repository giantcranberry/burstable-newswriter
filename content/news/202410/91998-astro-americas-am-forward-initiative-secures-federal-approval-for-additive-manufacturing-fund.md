<p>The Applied Science & Technology Research Organization (ASTRO) of America has achieved a significant milestone with the federal approval of the 'Stifel North Atlantic AM-Forward Fund,' a private equity fund under its AM Forward initiative. This initiative, a collaborative effort between ASTRO President Neal Orringer and U.S. President Joseph R. Biden, is designed to accelerate the adoption of additive manufacturing (AM) technology among small businesses within the aerospace and defense supply chains.</p><p>Granted a Small Business Investment Company (SBIC) license in partnership with the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) under the SBIC Critical Technology (SBICCT) initiative, the fund represents a historic step in bolstering public-private investments in critical technologies. Its mission is to offer tailored financing solutions to small businesses, focusing on advancing additive and advanced manufacturing capabilities within the domestic supply chain. Industry giants such as Lockheed Martin, GE Aerospace, and ASTM International are among the initial investors, showcasing robust private sector backing.</p><p>Neal Orringer highlighted the initiative's role in reinforcing America's Defense Industrial Base, acknowledging the invaluable contributions of partner organizations in providing resources, expertise, and mentorship to small and medium-sized manufacturers. The AM Forward initiative, spearheaded by ASTRO, unites seven leading companies and key federal agencies to assist small businesses in adopting metal 3D printing technology, emphasizing access to capital, machine validation processes, and workforce development.</p><p>Stifel North Atlantic, chosen as the financial partner for its expertise in supporting small and middle-market companies and managing SBIC Funds, plays a pivotal role in this endeavor. Victor Nesi, Stifel Co-President, expressed pride in empowering America's emerging small businesses with the necessary capital and strategic support to drive innovation, enhance manufacturing capacity, and bolster national security.</p><p>This initiative is a testament to the strategic importance of advanced manufacturing technologies in securing national security and economic competitiveness. By facilitating the adoption of these technologies among small businesses, the AM Forward initiative aims to strengthen the U.S. defense industrial base and position the country as a global leader in critical technology sectors. The approval of the fund under the SBICCT program exemplifies a innovative approach to fostering critical technologies through public-private partnerships, signaling the government's dedication to leveraging private sector resources for strategic national priorities.</p><p>The initiative's progress is anticipated to have a profound impact on the U.S. manufacturing sector, enabling small businesses to invest in state-of-the-art AM technologies. This could lead to significant advancements in productivity, innovation, and competitiveness, particularly in the aerospace and defense industries. Furthermore, the success of the AM Forward initiative may pave the way for similar public-private collaborations in other critical technology areas, potentially redefining the U.S. approach to industrial policy and technological advancement in key sectors.</p>
