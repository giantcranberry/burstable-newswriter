This innovation merges Data Vault's ADIO technology with HYPERVSN's 3D holographic visuals, offering an immersive experience that could alter business-audience interactions. The timing of DVHolo's launch aligns with the holographic industry's rapid expansion, projected by Global Market Insights to hit a $23 billion valuation by 2032, growing at a 20% CAGR from 2024 to 2032.</p><p>DVHolo stands out by providing 40% longer viewer engagement and doubling the visibility of holographic images compared to 2D digital signage, according to Data Vault.
