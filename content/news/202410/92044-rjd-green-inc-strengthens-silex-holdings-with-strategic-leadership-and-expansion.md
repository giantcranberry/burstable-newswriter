<p>RJD Green Inc. (OTCPK: RJDG) has taken a significant step to enhance its Silex Holdings division by appointing Mark Gould, a manager with extensive experience in the construction products industry, to lead the consolidation and growth of its Tulsa Division. CEO Ron Brewer announced this strategic move, emphasizing Gould's proven ability to manage rapid growth and drive sales in small-cap businesses, a skill set deemed crucial for Silex's ambitious expansion plans.</p><p>Gould's appointment is timely as Silex Holdings integrates JSI Products Corporation into its operations. His recent success in growing a wholesale construction products company from under $1 million to over $6 million in annual revenue highlights his capability to steer Silex's growth. Brewer pointed out Gould's knack for fostering team efforts and navigating the challenges of achieving fast growth revenue goals, which will be invaluable as Silex aims to profitably add new products and services to its portfolio.</p><p>The consolidation of JSI Products Corporation into Silex Holdings represents a pivotal development for RJD Green Inc. JSI Products, a newly formed Oklahoma Corporation, has acquired state-of-the-art manufacturing equipment from JSI LLC, expected to boost daily production capacity and improve quality control. The integration will see JSI Products adopting the successful business operation processes that propelled Silex Interiors' revenue from $1.4 million to $5.8 million annually post-acquisition.</p><p>Silex Holdings Inc., specializing in construction products, offers manufacturing, sales, distribution, and installation services for cabinetry, stone countertops, walls, and flooring. Serving a diverse clientele within a 200-mile radius of Oklahoma City and Tulsa, the company's strategic moves, including Gould's appointment and JSI Products' integration, are part of RJD Green's broader strategy to strengthen its market position in the specialty construction and industrial services sector.</p><p>For investors and industry watchers, these developments underscore RJD Green's dedication to expanding its presence in the construction products market. The leadership of Mark Gould and the integration of JSI Products could open new avenues for product diversification and market expansion, potentially enhancing the company's future performance. As the construction industry evolves, RJD Green's strategic initiatives position it to leverage emerging trends and market demands, paving the way for sustained growth in a competitive sector.</p>
