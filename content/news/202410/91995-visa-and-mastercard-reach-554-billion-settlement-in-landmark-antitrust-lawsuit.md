<p>A $5.54 billion settlement has been finalized in one of the largest class-action lawsuits in U.S. history, marking a significant moment for businesses affected by Visa and Mastercard's antitrust violations. The lawsuit, In re Payment Card Interchange Fee and Merchant Discount Antitrust Litigation, accused the credit card giants of conspiring with banks to impose unfairly high processing fees on merchants from January 1, 2004, to January 25, 2019.</p><p>Merchants impacted by these practices may now be eligible to recover up to 1-1.5% of their total gross processing volume during the settlement period. This development not only offers immediate financial relief but also signals a move towards more equitable practices in the payment processing industry, potentially lowering costs for businesses and consumers alike.</p><p>The settlement's implications extend far beyond the immediate financial compensation. By addressing the anti-competitive rules that previously restricted alternative payment methods, this agreement could lead to a more competitive and transparent marketplace. Services like <a href='https://CardSettlement.com' rel='nofollow' target='_blank'>CardSettlement</a> are available to assist merchants in navigating the claims process, though participation in the settlement does not require the use of such services.</p><p>With the deadline for claims set for February 4, 2025, affected businesses are encouraged to act promptly. This settlement not only serves as a corrective measure for past injustices but also as a cautionary tale against future anti-competitive practices in the financial sector.
