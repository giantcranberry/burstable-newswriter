<p>Bloomfield Cooling, Heating & Electric, Inc., a prominent HVAC and electrical services provider in northern New Jersey, has announced a series of initiatives designed to offer homeowners significant savings this fall. These initiatives aim to enhance home energy efficiency and indoor comfort while making HVAC maintenance and upgrades more affordable.</p><p>From October 14 to November 30, homeowners can benefit from a $50 discount per HVAC system on routine maintenance visits for their furnace or boiler. This offer is timely, ensuring heating systems are thoroughly inspected and prepared for winter. The maintenance check includes examining air filters, thermostats, fuel and electrical connections, among other components, and provides immediate quotes for necessary repairs or replacements.</p><p>For those considering a complete HVAC system replacement, the company has partnered with Carrier to offer rebates through the Carrier Cool Cash program. Rebates of up to $2,200 are available on high-efficiency Carrier Infinity® furnaces with Greenspeed® Intelligence, with additional rebates for other Infinity and Performance® series equipment. These rebates are available until November 23, with installations required by December 28.</p><p>Financing options have been expanded, with qualified PSE&G customers eligible for 0% financing for up to seven years on HVAC installations valued at up to $25,000. This makes high-efficiency systems more accessible by allowing homeowners to spread the cost over their monthly utility bills.</p><p>Additionally, the company is offering attractive financing for Generac standby home generators, including 0% financing for 18 months with approved credit and a complimentary whole-home surge protector with installation. Annual maintenance services for existing generators are also available at a competitive rate.</p><p>Jack Lamb, general manager of Bloomfield Cooling, Heating & Electric, highlighted the company's dedication to helping customers take advantage of these savings opportunities. The company, celebrating its 35th anniversary, has received numerous accolades for its excellence in the HVAC and electrical contracting industry.</p><p>These initiatives are particularly relevant as homeowners prepare for colder weather and potential increases in energy costs. By providing discounts, rebates, and flexible financing, Bloomfield Cooling, Heating & Electric is enabling northern New Jersey residents to upgrade their home comfort systems affordably.</p>
