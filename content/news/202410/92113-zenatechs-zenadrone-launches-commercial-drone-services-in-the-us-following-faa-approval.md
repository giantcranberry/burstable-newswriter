<p>ZenaTech, Inc., a leader in AI drone solutions, has announced the commencement of commercial drone services in the United States by its subsidiary ZenaDrone, following Federal Aviation Authority (FAA) exemption approval. This development marks a pivotal moment in the commercialization of drone technology for industrial applications, with initial operations based in Phoenix, Arizona.</p><p>The ZenaDrone 1000, the company's flagship product, is now available for Drone-as-a-Service (DaaS) operations, catering to needs such as land surveying, inspection, and monitoring. This initiative not only showcases the drone's capabilities but also aims to accumulate the necessary flight hours for full commercial certification. Furthermore, ZenaTech is pursuing an FAA aerial spraying license, which would expand the drone's utility to agricultural tasks like plant nourishment and pest control, highlighting the technology's versatility.</p><p>Dr. Shaun Passley, CEO of ZenaTech, highlighted the significance of this milestone after a rigorous 18-month approval process. The FAA exemption allows for visual line-of-sight operations and data collection in the U.S., setting the stage for future beyond visual line-of-sight (BVLOS) testing overseas. The ZenaDrone 1000's design emphasizes stability, maneuverability, and heavy lift capabilities, equipped with AI and sensors for industrial applications, including smart farming and medical supply deliveries in collaboration with the U.S. military.</p><p>The launch of commercial drone services by ZenaDrone is poised to transform industries by enhancing efficiency, reducing costs, and improving safety in sectors such as construction, agriculture, and environmental monitoring. This advancement underscores the growing role of drone technology in driving operational efficiencies and fostering economic growth across multiple sectors.</p>
