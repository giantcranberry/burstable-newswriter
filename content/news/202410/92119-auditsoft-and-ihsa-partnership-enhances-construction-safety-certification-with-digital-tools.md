<p>The collaboration between AuditSoft, Canada's premier safety and compliance auditing software provider, and the Infrastructure Health & Safety Association (IHSA), signifies a pivotal shift in the construction safety certification landscape. This partnership designates AuditSoft's advanced audit software as the sole platform for conducting the IHSA's National Construction Safety Officer (NCSO®) exam audits, a cornerstone certification for health and safety professionals in Canada's construction industry.</p><p>This strategic move is geared towards equipping current and future health and safety professionals with the necessary technological skills for modern safety auditing. By mandating the use of AuditSoft's software for exam submissions, the initiative ensures that candidates are adept at utilizing digital tools, mirroring real-world safety auditing scenarios. This integration of industry-standard digital tools into the certification process is a testament to the evolving nature of the construction industry, where technology plays a critical role in enhancing auditing efficiency, accuracy, and data-driven insights.</p><p>The benefits of adopting AuditSoft's platform for the NCSO® program are manifold. Participants in Ontario's construction safety sector will acquire practical experience with digital audit tools, bridging the gap between theoretical knowledge and real-world application. The streamlined submission and review process for exam audits is anticipated to improve evaluation efficiency and accuracy, potentially expediting the certification process for candidates.</p><p>Jennifer McKenzie, Director of Stakeholder & Client Engagement at IHSA, highlighted the positive outcomes expected from this integration, drawing parallels with the successful implementation of AuditSoft in IHSA's Certificate of Recognition (COR®) program in 2023. Peter Spence, VP of Partnerships at AuditSoft, emphasized the initiative's role in workforce development, preparing future professionals with the tools needed to elevate safety standards in the construction industry.</p><p>The NCSO® certification is a nationally recognized benchmark that validates an individual's expertise in construction safety management, adhering to the standards set by the Canadian Federation of Construction Safety Associations (CFCSA). This partnership not only enhances the certification process but also sets a new standard for safety management in the construction industry, ensuring professionals are proficient in both safety principles and the latest technological tools.</p><p>As the construction industry increasingly adopts digital solutions, this collaboration between AuditSoft and IHSA is poised to influence safety standards and practices across Canada and beyond, marking a significant step forward in the integration of technology and safety education.</p>
