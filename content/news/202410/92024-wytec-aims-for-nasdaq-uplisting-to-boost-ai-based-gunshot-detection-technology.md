<p>Wytec (OTCQB:WYTC) has announced its intention to uplist to the Nasdaq Capital Markets, a strategic decision aimed at accelerating the development and deployment of its AI-based gunshot detection technology. This technology, part of the company's Pilot Smart Sensor Project, has shown over 90% accuracy in detecting gunshots, based on more than 400,000 live samples and simulated environments. The initiative is particularly focused on enhancing safety within America's Independent School Districts (ISDs) and cities.</p><p>The uplisting effort includes an expanded partnership with Lemko Corporation under a Master Services Agreement. This collaboration is set to combine the intellectual property and products of both companies to commercialize Smart Sensor solutions globally. Robert Sanchez, Wytec's CTO, highlighted the importance of this partnership, noting that Lemko's Distributed Mobile Architecture (DMA), backed by over 50 patents, will significantly improve Wytec's capabilities in tackling gun violence and the drug epidemic affecting children and students across the U.S.</p><p>Wytec plans to file its Nasdaq uplisting application in November, a move expected to enhance its visibility in capital markets and provide access to a $100 million shelf registration contract with Global Emerging Markets. This financial support could play a crucial role in scaling up the development and deployment of Wytec's technology.</p><p>Brian Ponte, Vice President of Sales and Marketing for Lemko, shared his optimism about the partnership, emphasizing its potential to deliver solutions that improve safety for children in the U.S. and internationally. The collaboration marks a significant advancement in addressing safety concerns in educational settings and urban areas.</p><p>Beyond gunshot detection, Wytec's proprietary AI/sensor technology also supports drug sensing and distance learning solutions, showcasing the company's comprehensive approach to public safety and education technology. This positions Wytec as a leader in innovative solutions for community protection and educational enhancement.</p><p>The timing of Wytec's Nasdaq uplisting and partnership with Lemko coincides with heightened national attention on school safety and urban gun violence. By leveraging advanced AI-based detection systems, Wytec is poised to offer transformative solutions to these urgent challenges, potentially redefining threat detection and response strategies for schools and cities.</p><p>As Wytec moves forward with its Nasdaq uplisting plans, its focus on pioneering AI and sensor technology for public safety underscores the increasing role of technology in solving societal issues. The initiative's success could have significant implications for school safety measures, urban security protocols, and the evolution of AI-driven threat detection technologies.</p>
