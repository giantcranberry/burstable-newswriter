<p>Ackerman & Co. and Novare Group have announced a collaborative effort to develop a two-building retail project in Sugar Hill, Georgia, marking a significant addition to the city's expanding downtown area. Located adjacent to Novare Group's Conclave Sugar Hill multifamily community, the project will feature buildings of 6,035 and 7,240 square feet, offering flexible retail spaces starting at 1,260 square feet. This development is designed to attract a diverse mix of tenants, including homegrown and regional restaurants, fast-casual eateries, boutiques, and shops, thereby enriching the local retail landscape.</p><p>The project, situated on a 4-acre site on Hillcrest Drive, is part of Sugar Hill's master-planned downtown, aiming to complement the city's existing amenities such as City Hall, The Bowl Amphitheater, and the Sugar Hill Art Gallery. Kelly Wilson, Senior Vice President of Ackerman Retail, will lead the leasing efforts, with the development expected to enhance Sugar Hill's appeal as both a residential and visitor destination. The inclusion of the 11.5-mile Sugar Hill Greenway and a pedestrian bridge connecting the development to downtown underscores the project's integration with the city's broader urban planning initiatives.</p><p>Leo Wiener, President of Ackerman Retail, and Jim Borders, President of Novare Group, both expressed enthusiasm for the project's potential to contribute to Sugar Hill's vibrant community. The development not only promises to add a dynamic retail environment but also includes plans for a public park on two adjoining acres, further boosting the area's community appeal. This initiative reflects the combined expertise of Ackerman & Co. and Novare Group in real estate development and retail leasing, positioning the project as a catalyst for further economic growth and urban transformation in Sugar Hill.</p><p>With its strategic location and thoughtful design, the new retail development is poised to become a cornerstone of Sugar Hill's evolving urban landscape, offering both economic and social benefits to the community.
