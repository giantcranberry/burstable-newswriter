<p>CleanCore Solutions (AMEX: ZONE) has unveiled a pioneering technology that leverages ozone to create an all-natural, effective cleaning solution, marking a significant advancement in the cleaning industry. Their patented Aqueous Ozone technology infuses water with ozone gas, producing a cleaner that eliminates the need for harsh chemicals in most cleaning processes. This innovation not only promises to reduce the environmental footprint of cleaning activities but also addresses health concerns associated with traditional chemical cleaners.</p><p>The technology utilizes nanobubble technology to deliver a concentrated solution of dissolved ozone, capable of killing bacteria and other germs more effectively than conventional methods. CleanCore's solution leaves no harmful residues, with only pure oxygen remaining after use, making it suitable for a wide range of applications from healthcare facilities to sports arenas. The company has already implemented pilot programs with major logistics companies and hotel groups, and its technology is in use in over 20 international airports, universities, and hospitals worldwide.</p><p>With the global cleaning services market projected to reach $630 billion by 2030, CleanCore's eco-friendly solutions are well-positioned to meet the growing demand for sustainable cleaning options. Their product line, including the PowerCaddy and MiniCaddy systems, has demonstrated superior cleaning effectiveness and cost-efficiency, reducing the need for storing and distributing traditional cleaning products. Additionally, CleanCore has expanded its offerings to include ice-making and laundry solutions, with commercial laundry units reducing dry time by up to 60% by eliminating chemical residue.</p><p>The effectiveness of CleanCore's Aqueous Ozone technology has been validated through third-party assessments, showing its ability to eliminate pathogens like Legionnaires' disease and protein residue from surfaces. This, combined with the absence of health risks associated with chemical cleaners, enhances the appeal of CleanCore's products. Recent regulatory actions to ban PFAS in the U.S. could further drive demand for CleanCore's solutions, as these 'forever chemicals' present in many cleaning products pose significant health risks.</p><p>CleanCore Solutions' innovative approach to cleaning technology not only meets current market demands for sustainability and health-conscious solutions but also aligns with broader environmental and health concerns. This development could signify a major shift in cleaning practices across various industries, offering a cleaner, safer, and more sustainable alternative to traditional methods.</p>
