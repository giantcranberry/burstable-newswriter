<p>Nicole England's latest publication, 'Resident Dog 2', brings to light the exceptional work of acclaimed architect Pol Theis, among others, by featuring over 25 of the world's most impressive homes alongside their canine residents. Theis' Sag Harbor residence in the Hamptons, along with his two English bulldogs, Louis and Margot, is prominently featured, showcasing the innovative design approach of P&T Interiors, his boutique interior design firm.</p><p>The book, a sequel to England's successful first volume, was inspired by her observation of how dogs add warmth and approachability to architectural spaces during photoshoots. This insight led to the creation of her Instagram account, Resident Dog, and eventually to this captivating book project. 'Resident Dog 2' takes readers on a global tour, from Mexico to Sydney, highlighting not only architectural brilliance but also the unique personalities of the homes' four-legged inhabitants.</p><p>The Sag Harbor residence, designed by Theis, exemplifies P&T Interiors' philosophy of creating spaces that reflect the client's tastes and lifestyle while bridging the gap between a project's potential and real-world constraints. The property, set in a forest overlooking a pond, features a harmonious blend of concrete and teak wood, with floor-to-ceiling windows that frame the natural surroundings. A black lap pool serves as a striking centerpiece, connecting the public and private quarters of the house.</p><p>The inclusion of Theis' work in 'Resident Dog 2' underscores a significant trend in residential architecture: considering pets as integral members of the household in the design process. This approach reflects a broader shift towards creating homes that cater to the needs and comfort of all occupants, both human and canine. For architecture enthusiasts, pet lovers, and design professionals, 'Resident Dog 2' offers a unique perspective on the interplay between high-end residential design and the pets that bring these spaces to life.</p><p>As the architecture and interior design industry continues to evolve, publications like 'Resident Dog 2' provide valuable insights into how designers are innovating to create spaces that are both aesthetically pleasing and functionally accommodating for modern lifestyles. The feature of Pol Theis' work in this book not only highlights his exceptional design skills but also serves as a testament to the importance of creating homes that are visually stunning and warmly livable for all inhabitants.</p>
