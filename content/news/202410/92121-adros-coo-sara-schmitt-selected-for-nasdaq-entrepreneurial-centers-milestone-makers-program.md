The Milestone Makers program, aligning with the United Nations' 17 sustainable development goals, offers Schmitt and other founders personalized mentorship over 12 weeks to achieve critical business milestones, culminating in a graduation ceremony in New York City's Times Square.</p><p>Schmitt's selection underscores Adro's mission to address the financial challenges faced by international newcomers, offering no-fee checking, savings, and credit card products.

The program's resources and mentorship could significantly aid Adro in scaling its impact, benefiting more international students and workers. Adro's recent achievements, such as raising a $1.5M pre-seed round and joining the 2024 Hudson Valley Venture Hub Accelerator, further demonstrate its commitment to growth and industry engagement.</p><p>As global mobility increases, fintech solutions like Adro's are crucial for ensuring seamless integration into the U.S. financial system. Schmitt's participation in the Milestone Makers program marks a pivotal moment for Adro, potentially enhancing its strategies and reach to support more international newcomers. This recognition not only highlights Adro's potential to make a substantial impact in financial inclusion but also signals a broader acknowledgment of the role such initiatives play in economic integration and sustainable development.</p>
