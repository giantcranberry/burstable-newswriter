<p>The Law Offices of Robert E. Brown, P.C. has filed a lawsuit against three Visiting Nurse Service (VNS) entities and home care attendant Joy Odunze-Matthew, following allegations of a violent assault on Carolyn Albanese, a terminally ill hospice patient. The lawsuit, lodged in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, Richmond County, accuses VNS and its affiliates of gross negligence for failing to properly vet, train, and supervise their staff.</p><p>According to the complaint, Ms. Albanese endured multiple attacks by Odunze-Matthew, with the most recent incident on September 10, 2024, captured on video showing the attendant striking the elderly patient with a weapon. This assault resulted in severe physical injuries and mental trauma for Ms. Albanese, raising alarming concerns about the care provided to vulnerable individuals in home settings.</p><p>Robert E. Brown, representing the Albanese family, highlighted the severity of the neglect and abuse, stating it represents a failure to protect one of society's most vulnerable. The lawsuit seeks compensatory and punitive damages for the harm suffered, with allegations including negligence, assault, and intentional infliction of emotional distress.</p><p>The case also intersects with a criminal proceeding against Odunze-Matthew, arrested on September 17, 2024, for felonious assault. This dual legal action underscores the potential systemic failures within the home care industry, prompting a reevaluation of caregiver vetting and supervision practices.</p><p>This lawsuit not only seeks justice for Ms. Albanese but also serves as a critical reminder of the vulnerabilities faced by hospice and elderly patients in home care. It may catalyze industry-wide changes, including stricter regulations and improved caregiver screening processes, to prevent future incidents and ensure the safety and dignity of all patients.</p>
