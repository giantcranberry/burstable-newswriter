<p>Cavitation Technologies, Inc. (CTi), a leader in ESG-focused nano-technology systems for fluid processing, has entered into a pivotal agreement with Desmet Belgium S.A., marking a significant milestone in intellectual property (IP) monetization and strategic business growth. The agreement, finalized on October 14, 2024, involves the assignment and transfer of select U.S. and non-U.S. patents, along with related intellectual property, to Desmet for global application in vegetable oil, fats, and oleo sectors. Notably, CTi retains exclusive, royalty-free licenses for these patents in critical areas such as water and wastewater processing, and alcoholic beverage production, ensuring the company's continued innovation and leadership in these fields.</p><p>Neil Voloshin, CEO of CTi, highlighted the transaction's potential to inject substantial capital into the company without diluting shareholder value, aligning with CTi's broader business objectives. This move not only secures financial resources for CTi's ongoing projects but also reinforces its commitment to advancing its core technologies in water treatment and beverage enhancement. The deal is set to conclude within ten days of the announcement, pending the delivery of necessary documents to Desmet, showcasing CTi's operational efficiency and strategic foresight.</p><p>For Desmet, a global leader in custom-engineered solutions for the food, feed, and biofuels industries, acquiring these patents and trademarks represents an opportunity to bolster its technological capabilities and market presence. The agreement exemplifies a growing trend among technology firms to strategically leverage their IP portfolios for growth, offering a blueprint for balancing monetization with innovation. As the tech and engineering sectors continue to evolve, the importance of IP as a strategic asset is increasingly evident, with CTi's approach serving as a potential model for peers.</p><p>The implications of this agreement extend far beyond the immediate financial gains for CTi. It signals a forward-thinking strategy in IP management that could influence how companies across the tech and engineering landscapes approach their own intellectual assets. Industry observers and investors are keenly watching how CTi will utilize the capital from this deal to fuel further research and development, particularly in its retained areas of expertise. The outcome of this strategy may well set a precedent for IP monetization and innovation in the sector.</p>
