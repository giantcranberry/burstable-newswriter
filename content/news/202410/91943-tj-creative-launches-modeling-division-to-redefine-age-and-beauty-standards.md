<p>TJ Creative, an Austin-based PR and marketing agency, has taken a significant step towards redefining age and beauty standards in the modeling industry by launching a new modeling division. Spearheaded by 38-year-old former runway model Krystle Kelley, this initiative aims to address the industry's narrow representation and celebrate beauty at every stage of life.</p><p>The collaboration between Kelley and TJ Creative's founder and CEO, Terrah Holder, marks a pivotal moment in the modeling world. Holder's vision for the division focuses on the growing demand for models in the 35+ age demographic, with Kelley embodying the elegance, experience, and relatability sought after in this market segment. Kelley's return to modeling, after a transformative branding session and photoshoot in Austin, highlights the potential for career resurgence at any age.</p><p>This strategic move by TJ Creative not only challenges long-held notions about age and beauty but also responds to a market demand for more diverse and relatable faces in advertising and fashion. Kelley's comeback has already garnered significant interest, signaling a readiness in the industry for more inclusive representation. The initiative could influence other agencies and brands to adopt similar practices, leading to broader changes in how beauty and age are perceived in media and society.</p><p>By normalizing the presence of older models, TJ Creative's new division may encourage more diverse casting choices across the modeling and advertising industries. This shift could have a profound impact on consumers, particularly those in the 35+ age group, by boosting confidence and altering purchasing behaviors through more positive and frequent representation.</p><p>As TJ Creative expands its services to include influencer marketing and brand representation, it sets a precedent for inclusivity in the modeling industry. The agency's innovative approach, combining Holder's expertise in photography and branding with a commitment to diversity, positions it as a leader in the evolving landscape of fashion and advertising.
