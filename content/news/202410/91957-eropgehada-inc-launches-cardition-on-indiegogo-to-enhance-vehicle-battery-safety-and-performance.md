<p>EROPGEHADA INC., a leader in eco-energy and renewable energy research, has introduced Cardition, a groundbreaking device designed to stabilize battery voltage and current in vehicles using far-infrared wave technology. Launched on the global crowdfunding platform Indiegogo, Cardition aims to mitigate the rising safety concerns associated with fire incidents in both internal combustion engines and electric vehicles, attributed to the increasing complexity of electrical systems reliant on a single battery.</p><p>The device's innovative technology leverages Illite, known for its superior conductivity and far-infrared emission properties, combined with a proprietary synthetic liquid developed over 12 years. This combination ensures the emission of far-infrared waves that optimize the battery's current and voltage output, enhancing the safety and efficiency of onboard electronics and potentially improving overall vehicle performance, including engine and transmission function.</p><p>Internal testing has demonstrated Cardition's ability to emit far-infrared waves continuously under various environmental conditions without external power, alongside passing rigorous safety tests for human exposure. Performance tests revealed an increase in vehicle output from 167.32 At to 181.10 At, with users reporting smoother driving experiences and reduced noise levels.</p><p>Cardition's plug-and-play design allows for easy installation on the positive battery terminal, requiring no additional batteries or complex wiring, making it an accessible solution for vehicle owners. Its launch on Indiegogo on October 29th, 2024, offers early adopters the chance to contribute to addressing a critical issue in vehicle technology.</p><p>As the automotive industry grapples with the challenges of electrical system complexity and safety, Cardition represents a significant advancement. Its success could herald a new era in vehicle current stabilization, with profound implications for manufacturers, owners, and automotive safety standards worldwide.</p>
