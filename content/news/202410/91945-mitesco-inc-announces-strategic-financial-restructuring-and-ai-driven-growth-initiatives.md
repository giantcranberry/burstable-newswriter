<p>Mitesco, Inc. (OTC:MITI) has taken significant steps to fortify its financial health and spur growth through a series of strategic initiatives, including the restructuring of over $8 million in debt and senior equity, with an ambitious goal to nearly eliminate all obligations by the end of 2024. This financial strategy is part of a broader plan that includes expanding its Advisory Board and advancing in the development of artificial intelligence (AI) based sales automation software, signaling a strong push towards innovation and operational efficiency.</p><p>CEO Mack Leath highlighted the company's aggressive stance on clearing legacy liabilities to pave the way for expansion in 2025. The restructuring efforts have already seen holders of more than $8 million in debt and senior securities converting their holdings into common stock at $4 per share, with expectations for the majority of remaining liabilities to follow in the near future. Additionally, Mitesco is introducing a new Series A Amortizing Preferred stock for accredited institutional investors, a move designed to further solidify the company's financial foundation and support its long-term business strategies.</p><p>The company has also enhanced its Advisory Board with the addition of Gabriel Crawford and Jim Clifton, bringing decades of expertise in data center development and sales and marketing in systems software and data analytics, respectively. Their contributions are anticipated to accelerate Mitesco's gains in key accounts and improve data center operations, particularly within its Centcore data services division.</p><p>On the technological front, Mitesco's Vero Technology Ventures subsidiary is delving into cloud computing solutions and developing AI-based applications, including a new 'Robo' application aimed at boosting sales and marketing efficiency. These initiatives underscore Mitesco's commitment to leveraging cutting-edge technology to refine its business model and offerings.</p><p>These strategic developments represent a holistic approach by Mitesco to not only address its financial challenges but also to embrace technological innovation and expertise. By doing so, Mitesco is positioning itself as a forward-thinking player in the tech industry, with the potential to significantly impact its market position and deliver enhanced value to clients and shareholders alike in the foreseeable future.</p>
