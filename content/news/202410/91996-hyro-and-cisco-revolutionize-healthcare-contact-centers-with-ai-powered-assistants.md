<p>The collaboration between Hyro, a member of Cisco's partner ecosystem, and Cisco has introduced a groundbreaking integration of AI-powered assistants with the Webex Contact Center and Finesse platform. This partnership is poised to redefine the efficiency and quality of patient support in healthcare contact centers across the United States.</p><p>At the heart of this innovation is an intelligent, conversational call-routing system designed to tackle the perennial issues of extended hold times and misdirected calls. By ensuring that callers are promptly connected to the most qualified specialists or live agents, the system significantly enhances the patient experience. Israel Krush, CEO & Co-Founder of Hyro, highlighted the transformative potential of this partnership, emphasizing its role in streamlining operations and improving patient interactions.</p><p>Beyond patient support, Hyro's AI assistants also automate a variety of employee-facing tasks, such as appointment scheduling and IT ticketing. This automation not only boosts operational efficiency but also allows live agents to dedicate their attention to more complex issues, thereby elevating the overall quality of support.</p><p>A standout feature of Hyro's platform is its ability to integrate seamlessly and securely with existing healthcare systems, including Electronic Health Records (EHRs) and Customer Relationship Management (CRM) systems. This capability ensures that interactions are personalized and informed by real-time data, offering a secure and customized experience for each caller.</p><p>The tangible benefits of this technology have been demonstrated by Intermountain Health, which reported an 85% reduction in call abandonment rates and a 79% improvement in speed to answer, alongside a 35% decrease in operational costs. Craig Richardville, former Chief Digital and Information Officer at Intermountain Health, lauded the integration for its revolutionary impact on call center performance.</p><p>This advancement is not just a boon for individual healthcare systems but signals a potential industry-wide shift towards more efficient and patient-centric healthcare delivery. As the sector grapples with challenges like staff shortages and rising patient expectations, the Hyro and Cisco partnership offers a scalable solution that could set new benchmarks for operational excellence and patient care in healthcare contact centers.</p>
