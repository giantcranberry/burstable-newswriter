<p>Wytec International, Inc. (OTCQB: WYTC), a leader in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and 5G technology, has taken a significant step forward in enhancing school safety by submitting five new patent applications to the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). These applications, filed on September 30, 2024, aim to protect the company's proprietary AI gunshot and sensor technology, building upon its existing small cell LPN-16 patents. This move underscores Wytec's commitment to addressing the urgent issue of school shootings in the United States, where over 1,200 incidents were reported between 2018 and 2023, affecting more than 1,000 victims.</p><p>The technology outlined in these patents offers school administrators a comprehensive dashboard that integrates visual, auditory, and airborne biological and chemical detection capabilities. Notably, it includes the ability to detect COVID-19 and other hazardous biological elements, showcasing the versatility and potential impact of Wytec's innovations. The patent filings comprise four Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) applications for international protection and one application filed under the USPTO's Track One program for expedited examination, covering various aspects of threat detection.</p><p>Wytec is currently preparing to implement its gunshot/sensor solutions in 43 Texas Independent School Districts as part of its Gunshot Pilot Program. This initiative highlights the practical application of Wytec's technology and its potential to significantly improve school safety measures. Robert Sanchez, Wytec's Chief Technology Officer, highlighted the strategic partnership with Dentons US LLP, the world's largest law firm, to manage their global patent and intellectual property portfolio. This collaboration is pivotal as Wytec seeks to expand its market presence and safeguard its innovations.</p><p>In addition to its technological advancements, Wytec is in the final stages of preparing its application to uplist from the OTCQB market to the Nasdaq Capital Markets under its current symbol WYTC. This transition could enhance the company's visibility and access to capital, further fueling its growth and development in AI-driven safety technology.</p><p>Wytec's recent patent filings and technological developments arrive at a critical juncture, with school safety being a top priority nationwide. The company's AI-powered threat detection systems represent a groundbreaking approach to school security, offering a solution that surpasses traditional measures. As Wytec continues to refine its technology, the implications for the safety technology industry are profound. The integration of AI, machine learning, and advanced sensor technology in threat detection systems may establish new benchmarks for school safety protocols and inspire further innovation in the sector.</p><p>With a focus on securing both national and international patent protection, Wytec demonstrates a clear vision for global expansion. This strategy not only positions the company as a leader in safety technology but also opens the door to addressing school safety challenges on an international scale.
