<p>Conversion Logix has introduced CLiQ, a state-of-the-art marketing operating system tailored for the multifamily and senior living property management sectors. This innovative platform leverages artificial intelligence to revolutionize the management and optimization of marketing campaigns, providing industry leaders with advanced tools and insights to enhance performance.</p><p>Andrew Cederlind, President of Conversion Logix, highlighted the strategic advantage of CLiQ, stating it empowers marketing leaders to scale advertising efforts, manage large portfolios profitably, and gain critical attribution insights beyond conventional metrics. CLiQ's unique proposition lies in its combination of industry-specific advertising expertise and proprietary lead attribution data, enabling campaign recommendations that surpass market standards and ensure efficient use of marketing budgets.</p><p>Martin Stein, Chief Analytics Officer at Conversion Logix, pointed out the platform's advanced Unified Attribution capabilities, which employ probabilistic modeling for real-time, actionable insights. This feature addresses the challenge of accurately crediting marketing activities that have been traditionally undervalued, allowing for more informed decision-making.</p><p>CLiQ distinguishes itself by integrating human expertise with automation and AI, enhancing rather than replacing human decision-making. This approach ensures that marketing teams can scale operations efficiently while maintaining essential oversight. The launch of CLiQ is timely, as the multifamily and senior living industries face increasing competition, making advanced marketing tools and insights crucial for maintaining occupancy rates and property performance.</p><p>Conversion Logix's reputation, bolstered by seven consecutive years on the Inc. 5000 list and recognition in the Austin Business Journal's Fast 50 Growing Companies, adds credibility to CLiQ. The platform's introduction reflects the company's commitment to innovation and understanding of the unique challenges in multifamily marketing. With features like Unified Attribution set to become generally available in Q4, CLiQ is poised to set new industry standards by combining AI-driven insights with human expertise.</p>
