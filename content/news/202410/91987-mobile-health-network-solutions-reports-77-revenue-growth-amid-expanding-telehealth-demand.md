<p>Mobile-health Network Solutions (Nasdaq: MNDR), a leading telehealth provider in the Asia-Pacific region, has announced a remarkable 77% increase in revenue for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2024. The company's revenue surged to $14.0 million from $7.9 million in the previous year, underscoring the escalating demand for telehealth services in Southeast Asia. This growth was predominantly fueled by a $6.0 million rise in telemedicine and other services, complemented by a modest $0.1 million from the sale of medicine and medical devices.</p><p>Despite the impressive revenue uptick, the company reported a net loss of $15.6 million, a significant jump from the $3.2 million loss recorded in fiscal 2023. This was largely due to a 316% year-over-year increase in operating expenses, totaling $13.9 million. A notable portion of these expenses, $9.1 million, was attributed to non-cash, share-based compensation related to the company's Employee Incentive Plan and IPO-related services. Additional costs included a $3.0 million increase in selling, general, and administrative expenses, alongside a $1.6 million rise in salaries and benefits for key staff involved in the IPO and revenue growth initiatives.</p><p>On a positive note, Mobile-health Network Solutions achieved a 132% increase in gross profit, reaching $2.5 million, with the gross profit margin improving to 18.2% from 13.9% the previous year. Co-CEO Dr. Siaw Tung Yeng expressed optimism about the future, anticipating a sharp decline in non-cash, share-based compensation and IPO-related expenses in fiscal 2025, which is expected to significantly enhance the company's financial performance.</p><p>The company's expansion and success are reflective of the broader adoption of telehealth services in Southeast Asia. Its affordable, quality, and round-the-clock service model, offering access to a wide range of medical specialists almost instantly, has solidified its presence in Singapore and beyond. Co-CEO Dr. Rachel Teoh Pui Pui highlighted the company's unique positioning and its potential for accelerated growth in the coming years.</p><p>Mobile-health Network Solutions' achievements have earned it recognition as #41 in the Financial Times 2024 listing of 500 High-growth Asia-Pacific Companies. As the first Asia-Pacific telehealth provider listed in the US, the company is strategically poised to leverage the growing telehealth market in the region. While the company faces challenges in managing its operating expenses, its revenue growth and market positioning indicate a promising role in the future of healthcare delivery in Southeast Asia.</p>
