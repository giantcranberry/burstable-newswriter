<p>The renowned interior design firm P&T Interiors, under the leadership of Pol Theis, has been prominently featured in Nicole England's latest publication, 'Resident Dog Volume Two'. This coffee table book explores the unique relationship between exceptional architecture and the dogs that inhabit these spaces, offering a fresh perspective on design and livability.</p><p>Nicole England, an architecture photographer, initiated the 'Resident Dog' project after observing how dogs added warmth and a sense of home to architectural photoshoots. The book, which features over 25 remarkable homes worldwide, uses the properties' canine residents as guides to showcase the architectural beauty and personal touch pets bring to these spaces.</p><p>P&T Interiors' contribution to the book is a distinguished house in Sag Harbor, New York, known for its harmonious integration with the surrounding forest. The property, featuring Theis' two English bulldogs, Louis and Margot, exemplifies the firm's ability to blend eclectic materials and natural elements, creating spaces that are both aesthetically pleasing and deeply personal.</p><p>Theis expressed his honor in being part of the publication, praising England's unique ability to present designs in a personalized manner. This feature not only highlights P&T Interiors' innovative approach to residential design but also underscores the growing recognition of pets as integral members of the home, influencing design choices and living spaces.</p><p>'Resident Dog Volume Two' serves as a testament to the evolving design industry, where the lines between high-end architecture and everyday life blur, making room for spaces that celebrate both human and canine inhabitants.
