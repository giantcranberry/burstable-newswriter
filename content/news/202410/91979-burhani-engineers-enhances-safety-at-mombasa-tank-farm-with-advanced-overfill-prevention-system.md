<p>Burhani Engineers has recently completed a significant project to enhance safety measures at a major tank farm in Mombasa, Kenya. The company has designed, supplied, installed, and commissioned an advanced Overfill Prevention System for 13 storage tanks, marking a substantial improvement in the facility's safety infrastructure.</p><p>The newly implemented system is an extension of Burhani Engineers' previous work at the same facility, where they had already installed similar systems for two other tank farms. This latest addition ensures that the entire tank farm is now protected by cutting-edge overfill prevention technology, significantly reducing the risk of accidents and environmental hazards.</p><p>One of the key features of this project is its compliance with API 2350 standards, which are internationally recognized guidelines for overfill protection in storage tanks. This adherence to global best practices underscores the system's reliability and effectiveness in preventing potential disasters.</p><p>The scope of the project was comprehensive, covering every aspect from initial design to final commissioning. Burhani Engineers' team managed each phase meticulously, ensuring that all technical specifications and safety requirements were met. The system provides detailed warnings and alarms, enabling facility operators to make quick, informed decisions in potential overfill scenarios.</p><p>A significant challenge faced during the project was the lack of a fully independent overfill prevention system for the tank farm. To address this, Burhani Engineers developed a modular, scalable, and extensible solution. This innovative approach not only solved the immediate problem but also provided a framework for future expansions and upgrades.</p><p>The new system offers real-time data on tank levels and triggers alarms when necessary, providing facility operators with enhanced control over tank operations. By automating the process of monitoring storage tank levels, the system minimizes human error and ensures timely responses to any potential issues, thereby significantly improving overall safety and efficiency.</p><p>The successful completion of this project highlights Burhani Engineers' expertise in tank management and safety systems. Their team of skilled engineers and technicians applied their extensive knowledge to complete the project on time and to the highest quality standards, without disrupting ongoing operations at the facility.</p><p>This project has significant implications for the oil and gas industry in Kenya and potentially across East Africa. As safety regulations become increasingly stringent worldwide, such advanced overfill prevention systems are becoming crucial for tank farm operations. Burhani Engineers' successful implementation of this technology demonstrates their capability to meet these evolving industry standards and positions them as a leader in industrial safety solutions in the region.</p><p>The completion of this project not only enhances the safety of the Mombasa tank farm but also sets a new benchmark for similar facilities across the country and beyond. It showcases how advanced engineering solutions can significantly mitigate risks associated with storage tank operations, protecting both human life and the environment.</p><p>As industries continue to prioritize safety and efficiency, projects like this one by Burhani Engineers Ltd. play a crucial role in advancing the adoption of cutting-edge technologies in critical infrastructure. The success of this overfill prevention system installation serves as a model for other facilities looking to upgrade their safety measures and operational capabilities.</p>
