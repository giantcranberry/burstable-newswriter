          <p class='mb-4'><p>Silvercorp Metals Inc. (TSX: SVM) (NYSE American: SVM) has taken a significant step forward in its exploration and development efforts with the filing of an updated mineral resource estimate for its Condor gold project in Ecuador. This update, detailed in the 'Independent Technical Report for the Condor Project, Ecuador,' prepared by SRK Consulting (Canada) Inc., and effective as of February 28, 2025, marks a pivotal moment for the company and its stakeholders. The report not only provides a comprehensive overview of the project's current resource base but also sets the stage for future development plans.</p><p>The Condor gold project is a cornerstone of Silvercorp's portfolio, and this updated estimate serves as a critical tool for investors and industry observers. The involvement of SRK Consulting, a leader in mining and natural resource consulting, lends additional weight to the findings, ensuring that the data is both reliable and indicative of the project's potential. For Silvercorp, this update is more than just numbers; it's a reflection of the company's strategic focus on long-term growth, operational efficiency, and adherence to environmental, social, and governance (ESG) standards.</p><p>Beyond the immediate implications for Silvercorp, the updated resource estimate has broader significance for the mining industry in Ecuador. The country's rich mineral resources have positioned it as an emerging player on the global stage, and projects like Condor are instrumental in demonstrating Ecuador's potential to contribute significantly to the world's supply of precious metals. This development could have far-reaching effects, not only for the local economy but also for global markets that rely on a steady and responsible supply of gold.</p><p>For stakeholders, the updated estimate is a clear indicator of Silvercorp's transparency and its commitment to delivering value. It provides a solid foundation for assessing the company's future prospects and its ability to navigate the challenges of a competitive industry. As Silvercorp moves forward with the Condor gold project, the eyes of the mining community and investors will remain fixed on the outcomes of these efforts, which could redefine the project's impact and Silvercorp's standing in the market.</p></p>
