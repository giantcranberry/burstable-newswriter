          <p class='mb-4'><p>Act Bar, a pioneering protein bar brand known for its dedication to sustainability and social impact, has achieved a significant milestone by being selected for Sprouts Farmers Market's Innovation Program. Starting May 1st, consumers in Colorado and New Mexico will have the opportunity to purchase Act Bars at select Sprouts locations, marking a pivotal moment in the brand's expansion and mission to make a difference.</p><p>Founded by Amelia Allen, Act Bar sets itself apart by utilizing upcycled grains in its products, a process that not only minimizes food waste but also conserves water, saving about three gallons per bar. This innovative approach to snack production underscores the brand's commitment to environmental sustainability, offering consumers a way to contribute to the planet's health with every purchase.</p><p>Beyond its environmental efforts, Act Bar has established a partnership with Brighter Bites, a nonprofit organization, to donate half a pound of fresh produce to underserved communities for every bar sold. This initiative transforms the act of buying a snack into a powerful tool for community support, highlighting the brand's holistic approach to social responsibility.</p><p>Nutritionally, Act Bars are designed to meet the needs of health-conscious individuals, featuring 12 grams of plant-based protein and clean ingredients. This combination of health benefits and social impact makes Act Bars a compelling choice for consumers looking to align their purchasing decisions with their values.</p><p>Sprouts Farmers Market's Innovation Program is known for spotlighting emerging brands that excel in product quality and demonstrate a strong commitment to positive change. Act Bar's inclusion in this program not only provides the brand with a valuable platform for growth but also reinforces Sprouts' reputation as a supporter of innovative, purpose-driven food companies.</p><p>The availability of Act Bars in Sprouts stores represents a significant opportunity for the brand to broaden its audience and further its mission of creating sustainable, socially responsible food products. This development is a testament to the growing consumer demand for products that offer both nutritional value and a positive impact on society and the environment.</p></p>
