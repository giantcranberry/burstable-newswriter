          <p class='mb-4'><p>The collaboration between VueReal and ACA TMetrix represents a pivotal advancement in the microLED technology sector, aiming to streamline the adoption process for industries across Canada. By combining VueReal's cutting-edge MicroSolid Printing™ platform with ACA TMetrix's extensive distribution network and technical sales expertise, the partnership is set to overcome longstanding manufacturing and scalability challenges associated with microLED production.</p><p>MicroLED technology, known for its superior brightness and energy efficiency, has faced hurdles in mass production due to the complexities involved in transferring micrometer-sized LEDs. VueReal's innovative platform addresses these issues head-on, achieving a remarkable 99.999% yield rate and scalable throughput. This breakthrough not only enhances the commercial feasibility of microLED displays but also opens up new possibilities for their application in various sectors, including automotive, defense, consumer electronics, and education.</p><p>The Reference Design Kits (RDKs) at the heart of this partnership are designed to provide engineering teams with pre-configured microLED panels that boast exceptional features such as ultra-high brightness and sub-5-micron pixel pitch. These kits, coupled with localized technical support from ACA TMetrix, are expected to significantly reduce evaluation times and facilitate smoother technology integration for businesses looking to innovate with microLED solutions.</p><p>Robert Selley of VueReal and Patrick Leung from ACA TMetrix both underscore the transformative potential of this collaboration. By making microLED technology more accessible and easier to implement, the partnership not only accelerates product development cycles for companies but also contributes to the growth of the global microLED display market, which is projected to reach $30 billion by 2030. This initiative is a testament to the power of strategic partnerships in driving technological innovation and industry-wide adoption.</p></p>
