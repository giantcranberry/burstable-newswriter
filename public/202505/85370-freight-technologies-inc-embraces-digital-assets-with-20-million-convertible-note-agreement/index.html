          <p class='mb-4'><p>Freight Technologies, Inc. (Nasdaq: FRGT), a leader in supply chain optimization through AI and machine learning, has taken a bold step into the digital asset space by securing a convertible note agreement worth up to $20 million with an institutional investor. The initial $1 million tranche is earmarked for purchasing Official Trump Tokens ($TRUMP), underscoring the company's commitment to diversifying its investment portfolio with digital assets. This move is part of Fr8Tech's broader strategy to blend traditional logistics with cutting-edge digital technologies, signaling a forward-thinking approach to financial management and technological innovation in the logistics sector.</p><p>CEO Javier Selgas emphasized that this investment aligns with the company's mission to enhance U.S.–Mexico commerce through technology-driven solutions. Following a recent $8 million investment in FET tokens, Fr8Tech's latest venture into digital assets highlights a deliberate strategy to explore the potential of cryptocurrencies while continuing to focus on its core business of supply chain optimization. The company's portfolio, including platforms like Fr8App for cross-border shipping and Waavely for ocean freight management, demonstrates its expertise in leveraging technology to streamline logistics operations.</p><p>The decision to invest in digital assets reflects a growing trend among technology-focused companies to incorporate cryptocurrencies into their financial strategies. For Fr8Tech, this represents not just an investment in digital currencies but an opportunity to pioneer the integration of blockchain technology and digital assets into the logistics and supply chain industry. This strategic move could set a precedent for how traditional logistics companies adapt to the digital age, potentially transforming financial management practices and operational efficiencies across the sector.</p><p>As the logistics industry continues to evolve, Fr8Tech's investment in digital assets positions the company at the forefront of technological and financial innovation. This approach not only diversifies its investment portfolio but also enhances its capability to offer innovative solutions to its clients, further solidifying its position as a leader in supply chain optimization. The implications of this move extend beyond Fr8Tech, suggesting a broader shift in how logistics and technology companies might leverage digital assets to drive growth and innovation in the coming years.</p></p>
