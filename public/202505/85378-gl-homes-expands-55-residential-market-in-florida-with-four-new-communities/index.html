          <p class='mb-4'><p>GL Homes has recently unveiled four new communities within its esteemed Valencia line, significantly expanding its footprint in Florida's 55+ residential market. This move underscores the company's dedication to crafting premium living spaces for active seniors, with each community designed to meet the specific desires and needs of its residents. The new developments—Valencia Harbor in Fort Myers, Valencia Ridge in Wesley Chapel, Valencia Del Mar in Boynton Beach, and Valencia Sky near Naples—offer a range of amenities and lifestyles, from beach proximity to urban convenience and resort-style living.</p><p>Valencia Harbor is set to attract those looking for single-family homes starting in the mid-$300,000s, featuring an expansive clubhouse and easy access to Gulf Coast beaches. Valencia Ridge appeals to buyers seeking stylish one-story homes with the added benefit of Tampa Bay's urban amenities. For high-net-worth individuals, Valencia Del Mar presents spacious floor plans and a massive 43,000-square-foot clubhouse, while Valencia Sky offers state-of-the-art amenities and a resort-style living experience just five miles from downtown Naples.</p><p>This expansion is a testament to the vision of GL Homes' leaders, Itzhak Ezratti and his son Misha, who have positioned the company as a key player in Florida's residential development sector. By focusing on communities that blend thoughtful design with comprehensive amenities, GL Homes addresses the growing demand among 55+ homebuyers for sophisticated, low-maintenance lifestyles. These new communities not only highlight the company's commitment to quality and innovation but also its keen understanding of the trends shaping senior living today, including the desire for integrated social spaces, wellness facilities, and locations that foster an active and engaging retirement.</p><p>The introduction of these communities is significant for the 55+ residential market in Florida, offering potential homebuyers a variety of options tailored to their lifestyle preferences. For the industry, GL Homes' expansion signals a continued focus on catering to the baby boomer demographic, a group that values quality, convenience, and community in their living environments. On a broader scale, this development reflects the evolving expectations of senior living, emphasizing the importance of amenities and locations that support a vibrant, active lifestyle well into retirement.</p></p>
