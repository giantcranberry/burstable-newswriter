          <p class='mb-4'><p>SOBRsafe, a pioneer in advanced alcohol detection solutions, has recently announced the addition of two key figures to its leadership team, signaling a strong push towards innovation and strategic growth. Kris Pederson, with a rich background in corporate governance at giants like EY, IBM, and PwC, is set to join the Board of Directors on May 1, 2025, taking the helm of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. This move is complemented by the appointment of Dr. Benjamin Sanchez as a Scientific Advisor in February, aimed at strengthening the company's pursuit of federal funding and clinical research collaborations.</p><p>The timing of these appointments is critical, as alcohol misuse continues to pose a severe public health threat, ranking as the fourth leading cause of preventable death in the U.S. and seventh globally. SOBRsafe's cutting-edge transdermal sensing technology offers a groundbreaking alternative to traditional alcohol detection methods, enabling instantaneous alcohol presence detection through simple touch. This innovation is embodied in their SOBRcheck and SOBRsure products, designed for point-of-care screening and continuous monitoring, respectively, catering to sectors like behavioral health, judicial systems, and consumer markets.</p><p>With Pederson's governance expertise and Dr. Sanchez's scientific acumen, SOBRsafe is well-positioned to accelerate the development and deployment of its alcohol detection solutions. These leadership enhancements underscore the company's dedication to addressing the global challenge of alcohol misuse through technological innovation, potentially transforming how alcohol-related risks are managed across various industries.</p></p>
