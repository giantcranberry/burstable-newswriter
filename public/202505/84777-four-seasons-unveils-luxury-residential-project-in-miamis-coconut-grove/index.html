          <p class='mb-4'><p>The Four Seasons brand is set to redefine luxury living in Miami's historic Coconut Grove with the introduction of a meticulously designed 20-story residential building. This project, a joint venture between CMC Group and Fort Partners, will feature only 70 residences, emphasizing exclusivity and a deep connection to the local culture and environment. The development is poised to become a landmark, not just for its architectural beauty but for its commitment to preserving and enhancing the unique character of Coconut Grove.</p><p>Architect Luis Revuelta has taken inspiration from the natural surroundings of Coconut Grove, incorporating curved designs that mirror the area's iconic banyan and mahogany trees. This approach ensures that the building not only stands out visually but also harmonizes with the neighborhood's lush landscape. The interior design, led by Italian designer Michele Bönan, promises to bring European elegance to each residence, further elevating the living experience.</p><p>A highlight of the project is the expansive 10,000-square-foot spa, inspired by ancient Roman bathing traditions. This facility will offer residents a range of wellness amenities, including a sauna, cold plunge pool, and ice fountain, setting a new standard for luxury residential developments. Beyond the physical amenities, the project aims to foster a sense of community and connection to Coconut Grove's rich cultural scene, with its proximity to waterfront activities, gourmet dining, boutique shopping, and top-tier educational institutions.</p><p>This initiative marks another milestone in Four Seasons' expansion of its branded residential portfolio, which now includes 53 properties worldwide. The Coconut Grove project underscores the company's leadership in luxury hospitality and residential development, offering a living experience that is both globally sophisticated and locally rooted. For business and technology leaders, this development highlights the growing trend of luxury brands investing in residential projects that offer more than just high-end amenities—they provide a lifestyle that is deeply integrated with the local community and environment.</p></p>
