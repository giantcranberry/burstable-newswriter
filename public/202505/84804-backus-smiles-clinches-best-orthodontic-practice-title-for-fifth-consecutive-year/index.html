          <p class='mb-4'><p>Backus Smiles, a leading orthodontic practice in Homewood, Alabama, has once again been honored as the Best Orthodontic Practice of 2025 by the readers of Homewood Magazine. This marks the fifth consecutive year the practice has received this prestigious accolade, a testament to its unwavering commitment to excellence in patient care and its deep roots in the community. The recognition comes through the magazine's annual Readers Choice awards, where businesses are nominated and voted on by the community, highlighting the trust and satisfaction of the patients and families Backus Smiles serves.</p><p>Dr. Dominique Backus, the driving force behind the practice, shared her appreciation for the continued support from the community. The practice's success is built on a foundation of personalized care, offering a range of services including braces, Invisalign, and TMJ treatments tailored to meet the needs of adults, kids, and teens. This patient-centered approach has not only transformed thousands of smiles in the Homewood and Birmingham areas but has also set a benchmark for clinical excellence in orthodontics.</p><p>The significance of Backus Smiles' achievement extends beyond the accolades. It reflects the growing importance of community-focused healthcare practices that prioritize patient comfort and individualized treatment plans. In an era where healthcare is increasingly corporatized, Backus Smiles stands out as a beacon of how locally owned and operated practices can thrive by fostering strong relationships with their patients and communities. This recognition serves as a reminder of the value of personalized care in achieving not just clinical success but also in building lasting community ties.</p><p>For leaders in the business and technology sectors, the story of Backus Smiles offers insights into the power of community engagement and the importance of maintaining a patient-first approach in healthcare. It underscores the potential for small, specialized practices to achieve remarkable success and recognition through dedication to excellence and community service. As the healthcare industry continues to evolve, the model presented by Backus Smiles could inspire other practices to prioritize patient care and community involvement as key pillars of their business strategy.</p></p>
