          <p class='mb-4'><p>Fusion Fuel Green PLC (NASDAQ: HTOO) has taken a significant step forward in its strategic expansion by acquiring a UK-based fuel distribution business for £50 million. This move, financed through £40 million in debt and £10 million in Fusion Fuel ordinary shares, underscores the company's commitment to building a diversified and synergistic energy portfolio. The acquired company, with its strong financial performance including $58 million in revenues and $7 million in net income for fiscal year 2025, presents a valuable addition to Fusion Fuel's operations.</p><p>The acquisition is particularly notable for its alignment with Fusion Fuel's existing operations, especially its Al Shola Gas brand, which specializes in industrial gas solutions. By integrating the UK-based company's distribution capabilities, Fusion Fuel is poised to enhance its service offerings across commercial, industrial, and residential sectors. This strategic expansion not only broadens Fusion Fuel's market reach but also reinforces its position in the energy sector.</p><p>Furthermore, this acquisition supports Fusion Fuel's broader objectives through its BrightHy subsidiary, which focuses on hydrogen solutions for decarbonizing hard-to-abate industries. By leveraging the acquired company's distribution network, Fusion Fuel can accelerate the adoption of innovative engineering and advisory services aimed at reducing carbon emissions. This move reflects the company's forward-thinking approach to energy services and its dedication to creating value through strategic acquisitions that bolster its market position and technological prowess.</p><p>The implications of this acquisition extend beyond Fusion Fuel's growth. It signals a growing trend in the energy sector towards consolidation and diversification as companies seek to adapt to the evolving demands of decarbonization and sustainable energy solutions. For industry leaders and stakeholders, Fusion Fuel's strategic move highlights the importance of innovation and strategic partnerships in navigating the transition to a greener economy.</p></p>
