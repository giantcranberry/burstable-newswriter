          <p class='mb-4'><p>SBC Medical Group Holdings Inc. has demonstrated remarkable financial resilience and strategic growth in the first quarter of 2025, despite a challenging market environment. The company reported a 5% year-over-year increase in earnings per share to $0.21, alongside a notable rise in EBITDA margins to 52% from 46% in the previous year. This financial uptick comes even as revenues saw a 14% decline to $47 million, a figure attributed to the divestiture of certain business segments. However, net income experienced a 15% increase, underscoring the company's effective cost management and operational efficiency.</p><p>The expansion of SBC Medical's operational footprint is a key highlight of the quarter, with the company ending the period with 251 clinics, up by 36 from the previous year. This growth is complemented by a 14% increase in its customer base, reaching 6.1 million customers over the twelve months through March. A significant 71% of these customers visited franchisee clinics multiple times during the quarter, indicating strong brand loyalty and customer satisfaction.</p><p>CEO Yoshiyuki Aikawa has outlined the company's strategic priorities, focusing on platform enhancement and profitability optimization through revised pricing strategies. Furthermore, SBC Medical is aggressively pursuing international expansion, with plans to enter markets such as the United States and Singapore. This move is aimed at differentiating the company by making aesthetic medicine more accessible and appealing to a broader audience.</p><p>In a bold statement of confidence, SBC Medical announced a share buyback program valued at up to $5 million, scheduled to run from May 20, 2025, to May 20, 2026. This initiative, funded by excess cash and future free cash flow, reflects the company's belief that its current stock price does not fully capture its business performance and market potential.</p><p>The global cosmetic surgery market, valued at $122.08 billion in 2022, is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 14.7% through 2030, presenting a fertile ground for SBC Medical's expansion and growth strategies. By leveraging its expanding clinic network, optimized pricing, and strategic financial maneuvers, SBC Medical is well-positioned to tap into the increasing demand for aesthetic medical services, promising enhanced value for its shareholders and stakeholders alike.</p></p>
