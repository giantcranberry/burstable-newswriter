          <p class='mb-4'><p>NextPlat Corp. (NASDAQ: NXPL), a global e-commerce platform company, is navigating through a pivotal leadership transition following the unexpected passing of its Executive Chairman and CEO, Charles M. Fernandez, on May 24. Fernandez, at the helm since July 2021, was instrumental in steering the company towards strategic growth and development, leaving a legacy that the current leadership is committed to honoring and building upon.</p><p>In response to this unforeseen event, the Board of Directors has appointed Rodney Barreto, a director since 2022 and Chair of the Audit Committee, as Interim Chairman, and David Phipps, President and CEO of Global Operations, as Interim CEO. These appointments are seen as a move to ensure stability and continuity in the company's strategic direction. Barreto's over 35 years of business and civic leadership experience, combined with Phipps' previous leadership in guiding NextPlat through its early growth and Nasdaq listing, positions the company to maintain its trajectory during this transitional period.</p><p>NextPlat Corp. operates in high-growth sectors such as technology and healthcare, focusing on helping businesses expand their digital market presence and revenue potential through strategic acquisitions, joint ventures, and collaborations. The company's e-commerce communications division offers a wide range of voice, data, tracking, and IoT products and services globally. Additionally, its subsidiary, Progressive Care Inc., provides pharmacy and healthcare data management services in the U.S., underscoring the company's diversified portfolio and commitment to innovation.</p><p>The sudden leadership change at NextPlat Corp. underscores the challenges companies face in maintaining continuity and strategic focus during times of unexpected transition. However, the appointment of seasoned interim leaders reflects the company's resilience and dedication to its mission. For stakeholders and the industry at large, this development highlights the importance of leadership depth and strategic planning in ensuring organizational stability and growth amidst adversity.</p></p>
