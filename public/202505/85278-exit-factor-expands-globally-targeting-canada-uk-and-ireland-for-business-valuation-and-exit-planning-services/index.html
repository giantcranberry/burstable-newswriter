          <p class='mb-4'><p>Exit Factor, a leading business value enhancement and exit planning franchise, is setting its sights on international markets, including Canada, the United Kingdom, and Ireland, as part of its ambitious global expansion strategy. This move comes on the heels of a remarkable domestic performance in the first quarter of 2025, where the company successfully sold six new territories across the United States. As a member of the United Franchise Group (UFG), Exit Factor is now looking for Master Licensees in these regions to replicate its U.S. success and bring its innovative business valuation and exit planning solutions to a broader audience.</p><p>Jessica Fialkovich, the founder and president of Exit Factor, has pointed out the strategic significance of this expansion. She underscores the universal applicability of the company's business model, which has already proven its worth in the American market. The franchise's domestic achievements, including the sale of ten new territories in December 2024 and its continued growth into 2025, have set a solid foundation for its international endeavors. Furthermore, Exit Factor's recognition as #28 on Entrepreneur's 2025 Top New Emerging Franchises list and its top position in the business coaching and services category underscore its industry leadership and the effectiveness of its methodologies.</p><p>To facilitate this rapid expansion, Exit Factor has onboarded a dedicated operations and training advisor. This strategic hire aims to maintain the high standards of service and ensure the seamless implementation of the company's business valuation and exit planning strategies in new markets. Exit Factor's comprehensive suite of services, which includes business valuation, value enhancement strategies, exit planning, and succession planning, is designed to cater to the nuanced needs of businesses looking to maximize their value and plan for future transitions.</p><p>This international expansion marks a pivotal moment for Exit Factor, not only in terms of its growth trajectory but also in highlighting the increasing recognition of the importance of professional exit planning services worldwide. By leveraging UFG's nearly four decades of franchising experience, Exit Factor is well-positioned to make a significant impact in these new markets, offering businesses the tools and expertise needed to navigate the complexities of valuation and exit planning. This strategic move is expected to not only benefit the company but also the broader business communities in Canada, the UK, and Ireland, by providing access to world-class exit planning services.</p></p>
