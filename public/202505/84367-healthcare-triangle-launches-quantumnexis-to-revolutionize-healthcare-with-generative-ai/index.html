          <p class='mb-4'><p>Healthcare Triangle, Inc. has taken a significant step forward in the healthcare technology sector with the launch of QuantumNexis, a subsidiary dedicated to pioneering generative AI-powered healthcare software solutions. This strategic move is bolstered by the simultaneous acquisitions of Niyama Healthcare and Ezovion Solutions, two tech firms with specialized platforms in digital mental wellness and hospital management, respectively. The initiative underscores the company's commitment to addressing pressing healthcare challenges through technological innovation.</p><p>Niyama Healthcare contributes a personalized generative AI mental health platform that utilizes extensive data analytics across psychological, physical, and behavioral domains. This platform has already made strides in various healthcare disciplines, including psychiatry and nutrition, serving over 5,000 clients in its pilot phase. On the other hand, Ezovion Solutions offers a cloud-based hospital information system designed to streamline care workflows, from diagnostics to revenue cycle management, on an FHIR/HL7-compliant infrastructure. Together, these acquisitions position QuantumNexis at the forefront of healthcare technology innovation.</p><p>Sujatha Ramesh, Chief Operating Officer of Healthcare Triangle, emphasized the strategic importance of QuantumNexis in the company's growth trajectory. By segregating generative AI SaaS innovations from traditional services, Healthcare Triangle aims to achieve scalable impact in the healthcare sector. David Ayanoglou, Chief Financial Officer, highlighted the financial rationale behind the move, pointing to improved transparency, capital strategy, and shareholder value as key benefits. The establishment of QuantumNexis marks Healthcare Triangle's focused entry into the generative AI healthcare software market, targeting underserved areas with potential for margin expansion through automation and product-led growth.</p><p>The launch of QuantumNexis represents a transformative investment in healthcare technology, leveraging AI to enhance clinical efficiency, mental health accessibility, and healthcare automation. By integrating Niyama's mental health technology with Ezovion's hospital intelligence platform, QuantumNexis is set to offer groundbreaking solutions to global healthcare challenges, signaling a new era in healthcare technology innovation.</p></p>
