          <p class='mb-4'><p>Mullen Automotive Inc. has announced a dramatic increase in revenue for the quarter ending March 31, 2025, with figures reaching $5 million, up from a modest $33,000 in the same period the previous year. This growth is attributed to the company's strategic deliveries of electric vehicles (EVs) to a diverse clientele, including logistics firms, local governments, and universities, marking a significant step forward in Mullen's quest to carve out a niche in the competitive EV market.</p><p>Key to Mullen's recent achievements is a new supply agreement with Enpower Greentech for advanced solid-state batteries, a move that underscores the company's commitment to innovation and sustainability. Additionally, Mullen has expanded its public sector contract eligibility through Sourcewell, further broadening its market reach. These developments come at a time when the company has successfully certified its Mullen ONE Class 1 EV cargo van and Mullen THREE Class 3 EV cab chassis truck with the California Air Resource Board (CARB) and EPA, making them available for sale across the United States.</p><p>Despite these advancements, Mullen faces financial challenges, with a reported net loss of $162 million over six months, including $118 million in non-cash expenses. The company's cash reserves have dwindled to $2.3 million, prompting a focus on cost-reduction strategies and financing through convertible securities. A significant recent development is the placement of Bollinger Motors, a majority-owned subsidiary, into court-appointed receivership, though Mullen asserts this will not materially affect its liquidity.</p><p>On a positive note, Mullen has secured Foreign Trade Zone status for its Tunica, Mississippi manufacturing center, offering benefits such as duty deferment and elimination of duties on exported vehicles. This, coupled with certifications like the Hybrid and Zero-Emission Truck and Bus Voucher Program (HVIP), which provides up to $45,000 in cash vouchers for the Mullen THREE Class 3 EV truck, positions Mullen as a forward-thinking player in the EV industry.</p><p>The implications of Mullen's growth and strategic partnerships extend beyond the company itself, signaling a shift towards more sustainable transportation options and the potential for significant environmental and economic impacts. As Mullen continues to expand its commercial dealer network and innovate in the EV space, its progress offers a glimpse into the future of mobility and the role of electric vehicles in shaping it.</p></p>
