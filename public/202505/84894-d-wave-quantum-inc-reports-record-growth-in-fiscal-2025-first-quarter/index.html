          <p class='mb-4'><p>D-Wave Quantum Inc. (NYSE: QBTS) has announced a record-breaking first quarter for fiscal 2025, with revenues soaring to $15 million, marking a 509% increase compared to the same period last year. This remarkable growth is attributed to the sale of a high-margin annealing quantum computing system, underscoring the company's strategic emphasis on high-value quantum solutions. The financial achievements were highlighted during a recent conference call by CEO Dr. Alan Baratz and CFO John Markovich, showcasing the company's robust performance in the burgeoning quantum computing sector.</p><p>The company's gross profit also saw a significant uptick, reaching $13.9 million, further evidencing the successful execution of its business strategy. With a customer base now totaling 133, including 69 commercial users and 25 from the Forbes Global 2000, D-Wave is clearly at the forefront of the quantum computing revolution. This expansion reflects a growing recognition among enterprises of quantum computing's potential to solve complex computational challenges across various industries.</p><p>Financially, D-Wave is in a strong position, ending the quarter with $304.3 million in cash, the highest in its history. This solid financial foundation enables the company to further invest in the development of its quantum computing systems, software, and services, ensuring its continued leadership in the field. As the first commercial supplier of quantum computers, D-Wave offers both annealing and gate-model systems, with its Advantage quantum computers featuring over 5,000 qubits available on-premises or via cloud infrastructure, backed by a 99.9% availability guarantee.</p><p>The quantum computing industry is gaining momentum as organizations increasingly seek innovative solutions to tackle optimization, artificial intelligence, and advanced research challenges. D-Wave's latest financial results not only demonstrate its growing market presence but also signal the broader adoption of quantum computing technologies in solving real-world problems. The company's achievements underscore the potential of quantum computing to transform industries, making this news particularly relevant for business and technology leaders looking to stay ahead in the rapidly evolving digital landscape.</p></p>
