          <p class='mb-4'><p>Fusion Fuel Green PLC (NASDAQ: HTOO) is set to broaden its energy services footprint with the acquisition of a UK-based fuel distribution business for £50 million. This strategic move, structured with £40 million in debt-financed cash and £10 million in Fusion Fuel ordinary shares, underscores the company's ambition to build a diversified and synergistic energy portfolio. The target company, with its robust financial performance including $58 million in revenues and a net income of $7 million for fiscal year 2025, presents a valuable addition to Fusion Fuel's operations.</p><p>CEO John-Paul Backwell highlighted how this acquisition complements Fusion Fuel's existing operations, particularly its Al Shola Gas brand, and aligns with the company's long-term vision. Al Shola Gas, known for its comprehensive industrial gas solutions, stands to benefit from the enhanced distribution capabilities and market presence this acquisition brings. The integration of the UK business is expected to bolster Fusion Fuel's position in the energy services sector, offering expanded services across commercial, industrial, and residential sectors.</p><p>This acquisition is a testament to Fusion Fuel Green's commitment to growth and diversification in an energy landscape that is increasingly demanding innovative and integrated solutions. By leveraging the strengths of the UK-based fuel distribution business, Fusion Fuel is poised to enhance its service offerings and operational efficiency, setting a new benchmark in the energy services industry. The move not only signifies Fusion Fuel's strategic expansion but also reflects the evolving dynamics of the global energy market, where diversification and synergy are key to sustainable growth.</p></p>
