          <p class='mb-4'><p>In just one year since its inception, Fortun, the fintech arm of Luminar Media Group, Inc., has made significant strides in the small business financing sector. With $6.4 million deployed in working capital and nearly 1,000 funding transactions completed, Fortun has not only expanded its operations to 38 states and Puerto Rico but also demonstrated the viability and necessity of alternative financing solutions for small businesses. The company's financial achievements, including $5.3 million in receivables, over $4.7 million in capital recovered, and more than $5.6 million in total assets, underscore its rapid growth and the trust it has built within the small business community.</p><p>The launch of Fortun Online, a digital capital access platform, and the securing of a strategic advisory partnership further highlight Fortun's commitment to innovation and accessibility in small business financing. President and CEO Yoel Damas described the company's first year as transformative, with a clear mission to address the capital gaps that many small businesses face. Through its subsidiaries—FortunCo, Fortun Advance, and Fortun Online—Fortun offers flexible, non-bank working capital solutions tailored to the needs of entrepreneurs and business owners.</p><p>Juan Sese, VP of Finance at Fortun, emphasized the company's focus on building momentum and fostering trust within the small business financing ecosystem. This approach has not only facilitated Fortun's rapid expansion but also reflected a growing market demand for alternatives to traditional bank financing. The company's strategic positioning within the fintech landscape suggests a continued trajectory of growth and innovation, promising to further empower small businesses across the United States.</p><p>Fortun's first-year performance is a testament to the critical role that fintech companies play in supporting the backbone of the American economy—small businesses. By providing accessible and flexible financing options, Fortun is not just filling a gap in the market; it's paving the way for a future where more entrepreneurs can realize their business aspirations. The implications of Fortun's success extend beyond its own growth, signaling a shift in how small businesses secure funding and the increasing importance of fintech solutions in driving economic development.</p></p>
