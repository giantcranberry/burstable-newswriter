          <p class='mb-4'><p>Super League Enterprise has successfully completed a public offering, raising gross proceeds of approximately $869,999, with Aegis Capital Corporation acting as the sole book-running manager. The offering involved the sale of 5,117,647 shares of common stock at a price of $0.17 per share. This financial maneuver is part of Super League Enterprise's strategy to strengthen its financial standing and support its business operations, including the development of innovative playable media platforms that aim to transform brand engagement.</p><p>The public offering also includes a 45-day overallotment option granted to Aegis, which could potentially increase the total gross proceeds to $1 million if fully exercised. The net proceeds from the offering, combined with the company's existing cash reserves, are earmarked for general corporate purposes, working capital management, and the partial repayment of outstanding debt. This approach underscores the company's commitment to maintaining a robust financial foundation while pursuing growth and innovation in the competitive playable media sector.</p><p>Aegis Capital Corporation's role in this offering highlights its expertise and continued support for emerging companies seeking to raise capital in the public markets. With over four decades of experience in investment services, Aegis has proven its ability to facilitate funding for businesses across various industries, further cementing its reputation as a trusted partner for companies like Super League Enterprise.</p><p>This development is significant for stakeholders in the business and technology sectors, as it demonstrates the potential for innovative companies to secure necessary funding through public offerings. It also reflects the growing interest in playable media as a tool for brand engagement, signaling a shift in how companies might approach marketing and customer interaction in the digital age. The success of this offering could encourage other emerging companies to explore similar avenues for raising capital, potentially leading to more innovation and competition in the playable media and related industries.</p></p>
