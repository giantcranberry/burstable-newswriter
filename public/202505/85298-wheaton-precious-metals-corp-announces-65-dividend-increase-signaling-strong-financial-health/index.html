          <p class='mb-4'><p>Wheaton Precious Metals Corp. (NYSE: WPM) has taken a significant step to reinforce its position as a leader in the precious metals streaming industry by announcing a 6.5% increase in its quarterly cash dividend. The new dividend of $0.165 per common share, up from the previous amount, is set to be distributed on or about June 10 to shareholders recorded as of May 28. This move not only highlights the company's robust financial performance but also its dedication to enhancing investor returns.</p><p>The company's Dividend Reinvestment Plan (DRIP) continues to operate, offering shares through treasury at the current market price without any discount for this quarter. This strategy further cements Wheaton Precious Metals' reputation for providing value to its shareholders through both direct dividends and reinvestment opportunities. As a premier precious metals streaming company, Wheaton distinguishes itself by offering investors a lower-risk avenue to gain exposure to commodity prices, a stark contrast to the volatility often associated with traditional mining investments.</p><p>Wheaton Precious Metals' portfolio, renowned for its high-quality, long-life, and low-cost assets, consistently achieves some of the highest cash operating margins in the mining industry. The decision to increase the dividend is a testament to the company's financial stability and confidence in its strategic direction. By continuing to offer a competitive dividend and focusing on accretive acquisitions, Wheaton Precious Metals not only strengthens its appeal to current and potential investors but also underscores its leadership in the precious metals sector. This development is particularly noteworthy for business and technology leaders seeking stable investment opportunities in commodities, reflecting broader trends in financial resilience and strategic growth in the industry.</p></p>
