          <p class='mb-4'><p>The DFW Car & Toy Museum has taken a innovative step by integrating technology into its daily operations, introducing 'Fast Fred', a fully autonomous robotic floor scrubber. This move not only modernizes the museum's maintenance routines but also adds an unexpected layer of entertainment for visitors. Named in honor of museum founder Ron Sturgeon's late twin brother, a drag racer, Fast Fred is more than a cleaning device; it's a tribute that resonates with the museum's automotive theme.</p><p>Equipped with BrainOS® software, the Tennant X4 ROVR, as Fast Fred is technically known, performs its duties with remarkable efficiency. It operates for three-hour shifts daily, autonomously navigating the museum's vast 150,000-square-foot space. What sets Fast Fred apart is its ability to engage visitors. Adorned with racing decals and a smiley face, the robot pauses politely when guests are nearby, turning a routine cleaning task into an interactive experience.</p><p>Brian Sturgeon, who oversees the museum's car galleries, highlights the ease with which Fast Fred operates. The robot's presence underscores the museum's commitment to innovation, blending the nostalgia of vintage vehicles with cutting-edge technology. This approach not only enhances the visitor experience but also sets a precedent for how facilities can leverage technology to add value beyond their primary offerings.</p><p>The introduction of Fast Fred at the DFW Car & Toy Museum illustrates the potential of autonomous technology to transform mundane tasks into engaging experiences. It serves as a case study for businesses and institutions looking to innovate in customer engagement and operational efficiency. As museums and similar venues seek to attract and retain visitors, the integration of technology like Fast Fred could become a key differentiator in the competitive leisure and entertainment industry.</p></p>
