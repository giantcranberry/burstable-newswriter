          <p class='mb-4'><p>Cambrian, a leader in water reuse technology, has achieved significant recognition for its collaborative project with Anheuser-Busch, earning a Distinction in the Industrial Project of the Year category at the 2025 Global Water Awards. This project exemplifies an innovative approach to managing industrial water, blending environmental sustainability with economic efficiency, and sets a new standard for the beverage industry and beyond.</p><p>The heart of the project is Cambrian's BlueCycle™ membrane bioreactor (MBR) system, implemented at Anheuser-Busch's Houston brewery. This system processes more than 400,000 gallons of high-strength wastewater each day, transforming it into water of drinking quality that is reused onsite for non-potable applications. This initiative has dramatically decreased the brewery's reliance on freshwater sources, marking a significant step forward in sustainable water management practices.</p><p>What makes this project particularly noteworthy is its financing model. Under Cambrian's Water-Energy Purchase Agreement (WEPA), Anheuser-Busch was not required to make any initial capital investment. Cambrian took on the responsibility of financing, constructing, and operating the system, with costs based solely on the volume of water treated. This model not only facilitates the adoption of sustainable technologies but also aligns with the financial interests of industrial partners.</p><p>The project's impact is substantial, with projections indicating that over its 20-year contract, it will treat 3.45 billion gallons of water, cut water and wastewater expenses by 20%, and avert over 23,000 tons of CO₂ emissions. This initiative represents the first large-scale application of Cambrian's WEPA model in the beverage sector, highlighting its potential for broader industrial application.</p><p>Matthew Silver, Cambrian's Founder and CEO, highlighted the project's dual achievements in environmental stewardship and economic efficiency, underscoring the value of innovative partnerships in tackling global water challenges. The Global Water Awards, organized by Global Water Intelligence, celebrate projects that stand out for their technical innovation, commitment to sustainability, and scalability in solving industrial water issues.</p><p>This accolade underscores a shift towards outcomes-based infrastructure, where environmental benefits and economic gains are interconnected. Cambrian's work with Anheuser-Busch illustrates how forward-thinking solutions can simultaneously reduce operational costs and environmental footprints, paving the way for more sustainable industrial water management practices worldwide.</p></p>
