          <p class='mb-4'><p>Recent preclinical studies conducted by researchers at Johns Hopkins have shed light on the potential of Lantern Pharma's experimental drug, LP-184, in treating atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumors (ATRT), a rare and aggressive pediatric brain cancer. Presented at the Society for Neuro-Oncology's Pediatric Neuro-Oncology Conference, the findings indicate a significant leap forward in the fight against this devastating disease.</p><p>In two distinct mouse models, LP-184 demonstrated a remarkable ability to extend survival rates, with one model showing a 345% increase in median survival from 20 to 89 days. This outcome, statistically significant with a p-value of less than 0.0001, underscores the drug's potential efficacy. ATRT, which is marked by the inactivation of the SMARCB1 gene, currently has no effective low-toxicity treatments, making these findings particularly noteworthy.</p><p>LP-184's success in preclinical trials is attributed to its potent anti-tumor activity across various ATRT subtypes, its ability to penetrate the blood-brain barrier effectively, and its favorable safety profile. These characteristics position LP-184 as a promising candidate for further clinical development. Lantern Pharma is preparing to advance the drug into pediatric Phase I trials by late 2025 or early 2026, pending the completion of ongoing adult trials and necessary approvals.</p><p>The development of LP-184 also highlights the transformative potential of AI in drug discovery. Lantern Pharma's proprietary machine learning platform, RADR®, has been instrumental in accelerating the drug's progression from initial insights to the brink of clinical trials. This approach has condensed the traditional drug development timeline to just 2-3 years, offering a cost-effective and efficient pathway to addressing unmet medical needs.</p><p>For families and patients grappling with ATRT, the preclinical success of LP-184 offers a beacon of hope. With limited treatment options currently available, the advancement of LP-184 into clinical trials represents a critical step toward changing the prognosis for this rare pediatric cancer. The implications of this research extend beyond ATRT, showcasing the broader potential of AI-driven oncology drug development to revolutionize treatment paradigms for rare and challenging diseases.</p></p>
