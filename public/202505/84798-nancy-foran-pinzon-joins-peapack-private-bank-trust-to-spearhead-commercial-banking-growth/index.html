          <p class='mb-4'><p>Peapack Private Bank & Trust has strategically enhanced its commercial banking division with the addition of Nancy Foran-Pinzon as a Senior Managing Director and Group Director. Based in Melville, New York, Foran-Pinzon is set to play a pivotal role in driving the bank's growth strategy across the Long Island and Tri-State Area markets. Her appointment underscores the bank's commitment to strengthening its commercial banking services and expanding its regional influence.</p><p>Foran-Pinzon's banking expertise is well-documented, with her most recent role as a vice president and group director at Flagstar Bank. Her tenure at Signature Bank was particularly notable, where she established the first Suffolk County PCG Group and Financial Center, achieving remarkable financial success. This included reaching $306 million in balances, $230 million in commitments, and $120 million in outstandings under her leadership. Her ability to drive strategic financial development and portfolio growth is expected to bring significant value to Peapack Private Bank & Trust.</p><p>Before her roles at Flagstar and Signature Bank, Foran-Pinzon accumulated extensive experience at Fleet Bank, serving in various capacities including vice president and portfolio manager for the contractor team. Her responsibilities encompassed working closely with relationship managers, ensuring portfolio quality, and supporting the underwriting process. A graduate of Babson College, Foran-Pinzon completed her Bachelor of Science in Finance in just three years, a testament to her dedication and efficiency.</p><p>This appointment is timely for Peapack-Gladstone Financial Corporation, which reported $7.1 billion in total assets and $11.8 billion in assets under management and/or administration as of March 31, 2025. Foran-Pinzon's proven track record in commercial banking and her strategic vision for growth align with the bank's objectives to enhance its financial services and client-centric offerings. Her leadership is anticipated to contribute significantly to the bank's expansion and the strengthening of its commercial banking division, offering new opportunities for clients and stakeholders in the region.</p></p>
