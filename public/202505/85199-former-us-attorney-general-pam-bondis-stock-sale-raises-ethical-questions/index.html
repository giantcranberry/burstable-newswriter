          <p class='mb-4'><p>The recent stock sale by former U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi has ignited a debate over ethical standards in financial transactions involving public figures. Bondi sold between $1 million and $5 million worth of Trump Media & Technology Group stock on April 2, 2025, coinciding with President Donald Trump's announcement of new tariffs that led to a market downturn. This timing has raised questions about the potential for insider information influencing the sale, though no evidence has been presented to substantiate such claims.</p><p>Bondi's financial disclosure forms confirm the sale, but the exact timing in relation to the market's closure remains unclear. Her previous role as a consultant for Digital World Acquisition Corp., the special purpose acquisition company that brought Trump Media to public trading, adds layers of complexity to the transaction. Given her position as a former attorney general, Bondi was obligated to divest her holdings within 90 days of her confirmation, a requirement that underscores the importance of adherence to ethical guidelines to maintain public trust.</p><p>The stock of Trump Media & Technology Group, currently trading at $19.45, has seen a 2.1% increase from the previous market close. The company, established as an alternative social media platform championing free expression, remains under scrutiny both financially and publicly. This incident highlights the ongoing challenges in ensuring transparency and ethical compliance in the intersection of politics, business, and technology, serving as a reminder of the delicate balance required to uphold integrity in public office and financial dealings.</p></p>
