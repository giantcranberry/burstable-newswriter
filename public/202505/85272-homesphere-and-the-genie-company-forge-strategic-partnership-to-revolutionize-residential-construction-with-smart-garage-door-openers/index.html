          <p class='mb-4'><p>The residential construction industry is set to witness a transformative shift with the announcement of a strategic partnership between HomeSphere and The Genie Company. This collaboration is poised to offer more than 2,700 builders in HomeSphere's network exclusive rebates on The Genie Company's Pro Series garage door openers, including both Wi-Fi and non-Wi-Fi models. These advanced models are designed to integrate seamlessly with leading smart home platforms and support voice control, thereby enhancing homeowner convenience and pushing the envelope in smart home technology.</p><p>Steve Janas, Vice President of Sales and Marketing at The Genie Company, underscored the partnership's goal to arm builder partners with innovative tools and added value. Echoing this sentiment, Greg Schwarzer, President and CEO of HomeSphere, pointed out the dual benefits of cutting-edge functionality and cost savings for builders. This initiative not only underscores the companies' commitment to innovation but also highlights the potential for significant savings and efficiency gains in the construction process.</p><p>With HomeSphere's network responsible for constructing and closing over 250,000 new homes and units each year, the implications of this partnership extend far beyond immediate cost savings. It represents a pivotal moment in the residential construction industry's journey towards embracing smart home technologies. By facilitating access to advanced garage door opener technologies at competitive prices, the partnership is expected to accelerate the adoption of smart home features in new builds, setting a new standard for residential construction and homeowner expectations.</p><p>The collaboration between HomeSphere and The Genie Company is a testament to the growing trend of integrating advanced technological solutions into residential construction. It not only offers builders the tools to meet the evolving demands of homeowners but also positions the industry at the forefront of the smart home revolution. As the partnership unfolds, its impact on the adoption of smart home technologies and the broader residential construction landscape will be closely watched by industry leaders and homeowners alike.</p></p>
