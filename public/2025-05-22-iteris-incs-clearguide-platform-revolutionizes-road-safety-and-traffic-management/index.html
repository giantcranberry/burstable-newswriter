          <p class='mb-4'><p>In an era where traffic congestion and road safety are pressing concerns, Iteris Inc.'s ClearGuide transportation analytics platform stands out as a beacon of innovation. By harnessing anonymized geolocation data from smart devices, ClearGuide offers a comprehensive suite of tools designed to tackle the inefficiencies plaguing today's transportation systems. With Americans losing an average of 54 hours each year to traffic delays and accidents costing the economy $340 billion annually, the need for such advanced solutions has never been more critical.</p><p>ClearGuide's specialized modules, including ClearGuide Safety and ClearGuide Roadways, empower agencies to pinpoint speeding hotspots, analyze red-light running patterns, and assess pedestrian safety risks with unprecedented precision. This capability not only facilitates targeted interventions to mitigate accidents but also validates citizen-reported safety concerns without the need for extensive field deployments. Furthermore, the platform's Road Surface Information dataset plays a pivotal role in preemptive road maintenance, identifying potential hazards like potholes and uneven surfaces before they escalate into serious threats.</p><p>The platform's real-time traffic condition updates, refreshed every five minutes, are instrumental in enhancing operational efficiency, incident management, and work zone mobility. By reducing the reliance on field personnel, ClearGuide not only cuts down on operational hours but also significantly improves worker safety. Its advanced analytics extend to traffic signal performance and congestion reporting, making it an indispensable tool for transportation agencies at all levels.</p><p>As initiatives like Vision Zero gain momentum worldwide, aiming to eradicate traffic fatalities, technologies such as ClearGuide are at the forefront of creating safer and more efficient transportation ecosystems. The platform's ability to provide detailed, data-driven insights enables agencies to make informed decisions that safeguard both motorists and pedestrians, marking a significant leap forward in the quest for smarter, safer roads.</p></p>
