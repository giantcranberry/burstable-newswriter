          <p class='mb-4'><p>KDW, a design-build firm with deep roots in Texas, has reached a monumental milestone, celebrating 130 years of continuous family ownership and leadership in the industry. Originally established in 1895 in Nacogdoches, Texas, KDW has evolved from a local construction company into a comprehensive design-build enterprise that serves clients on a national and global scale. This longevity is a testament to the firm's ability to adapt and innovate while maintaining the core values that have guided it through five generations.</p><p>The company's journey began with the Kingham family, focusing on constructing essential infrastructure in East Texas, including educational institutions, healthcare facilities, and religious buildings. The formation of Kingham Dalton Wilson, Ltd. (KDW) in 2004 marked a new chapter, combining decades of experience with cutting-edge practices. Today, KDW operates from offices in Houston, Austin, and Nacogdoches, offering an integrated, single-contract design-build model that includes in-house architects, designers, and multidisciplinary professionals.</p><p>KDW's portfolio is impressive, with over 2,500 projects valued at more than $1 billion. The firm has worked with notable clients such as Elin Energy, Waaree Solar, and Goya Foods, and has constructed landmark venues like Typhoon Texas Waterparks and the Fredonia Hotel. These achievements highlight KDW's commitment to excellence and its ability to meet the diverse needs of commercial and industrial clients.</p><p>Keith Dalton, Co-founder and CEO of KDW, attributes the company's success to its foundational commitment to excellence and the importance of building strong client relationships. By fostering open collaboration with clients, design partners, and trade professionals, KDW has established a framework of trust and transparency that has been key to its longevity. With a team of over 100 multidisciplinary experts, KDW continues to innovate, delivering projects that address the evolving needs of businesses worldwide while staying true to the values that have sustained the company for 130 years.</p><p>This milestone is not just a celebration of KDW's past achievements but also a look forward to the future. As the design-build industry continues to evolve, KDW's blend of tradition and innovation positions it as a leader ready to meet the challenges of the next century. For business and technology leaders, KDW's story offers insights into the importance of adaptability, client relationships, and a commitment to excellence in achieving long-term success.</p></p>
