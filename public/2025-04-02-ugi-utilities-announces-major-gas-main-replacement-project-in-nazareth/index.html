          <p class='mb-4'><p>UGI Utilities, Inc. has unveiled plans for a significant gas main replacement project in Nazareth, scheduled to commence on April 7, 2025. This ambitious initiative is designed to upgrade the aging infrastructure, ensuring the continued safety and reliability of natural gas services for the community. The project, which will span several months until late September, will focus on key streets including East Prospect Street, South Cedar Street, East Park Street, South Broad Street, East Walnut Street, and South Main Street.</p><p>The construction activities, set to take place from Monday to Friday between 7 am and 5 pm, are expected to bring about road closures, detours, and traffic delays. Additionally, parking restrictions will be enforced on the affected streets, and some residents may experience temporary interruptions to their natural gas service. UGI has emphasized the necessity of property access to inspect and relight gas equipment as part of the upgrade process, urging cooperation from the community.</p><p>Despite the anticipated inconveniences, the project underscores UGI's dedication to maintaining high standards of utility service. It also presents an opportunity for certain homes and businesses along the project's path to transition to natural gas, potentially offering long-term benefits in terms of efficiency and cost savings. However, the completion timeline may be subject to adjustments based on weather conditions and the complexities of the on-site working environment.</p><p>Residents and businesses in the impacted areas are encouraged to prepare for the construction period, remaining adaptable to changes and planning ahead to mitigate disruptions. This infrastructure upgrade is a critical step forward in ensuring the resilience and sustainability of Nazareth's utility systems, reflecting a broader commitment to community safety and service excellence.</p></p>
