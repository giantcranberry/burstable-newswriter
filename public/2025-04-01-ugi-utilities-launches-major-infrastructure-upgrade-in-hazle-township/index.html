          <p class='mb-4'><p>UGI Utilities, Inc. has initiated a pivotal infrastructure upgrade in Hazle Township, Luzerne County, marking a significant step forward in the region's energy reliability and accessibility. The project, focusing on gas main replacement and system improvements along Hazle Township Boulevard between Hillside Drive and Christine Road, is set to continue until late June. This initiative not only aims to modernize the natural gas distribution network but also opens up opportunities for local properties to connect to natural gas services, potentially lowering energy costs and reducing environmental impact.</p><p>The construction schedule, running from Monday to Friday between 7 am and 5 pm, is expected to bring about temporary inconveniences such as road closures, detours, and parking restrictions. Additionally, residents and businesses may experience brief interruptions in natural gas service. However, these short-term disruptions are a necessary step towards achieving long-term benefits, including enhanced safety and efficiency of the gas distribution system.</p><p>UGI Utilities' commitment to this project reflects its broader dedication to serving over 760,000 customers with reliable and safe energy solutions. The upgrade is a testament to the company's ongoing investment in infrastructure that supports community development and meets the evolving needs of its customers. By prioritizing such improvements, UGI Utilities not only ensures the resilience of its network but also contributes to the economic and environmental well-being of the communities it serves.</p><p>As the project progresses, UGI Utilities will work closely with the community to minimize disruptions and keep stakeholders informed about developments. The completion of this upgrade will mark a significant milestone in Hazle Township's infrastructure, offering residents and businesses access to more reliable and efficient natural gas services. This initiative underscores the importance of continuous investment in energy infrastructure to support sustainable growth and meet future energy demands.</p></p>
