          <p class='mb-4'><p>Metavesco, Inc. (OTC: MVCO) has taken a significant step forward in the staffing industry with the launch of an AI-powered virtual staffing pilot in Gainesville, Georgia. This innovative program leverages machine-learning algorithms and generative AI to automate the entire staffing process, from sourcing and screening to dispatching and managing qualified labor in real time. By eliminating the need for a traditional physical office, the company aims to drastically reduce overhead costs while improving operational efficiency.</p><p>Ryan Schadel, CEO of Metavesco, shared insights into the pilot's potential to transform the on-demand staffing model. The integration of intelligent systems at every operational touchpoint is expected to not only streamline processes but also enhance the quality of service provided to both clients and workers. Key features of the pilot include automated talent sourcing and screening, predictive demand forecasting, conversational AI support, and dynamic dispatch and scheduling. These technologies are projected to reduce time-to-fill positions by up to 60%, anticipate client needs through advanced data analysis, offer 24/7 customer service, and optimize worker assignments based on a variety of criteria.</p><p>The Gainesville pilot represents a bold move towards lean and high-margin growth for Metavesco, with a scalable roll-out plan that could set new industry standards. The company's subsidiary, Epic Labor, Inc., which specializes in providing fast and reliable on-demand labor to small and mid-sized businesses, stands to benefit significantly from this technological advancement. The pilot not only offers a first-mover advantage in the integration of deep-tech AI with blue-collar staffing but also promises to create shareholder value through enhanced margins and rapid market penetration.</p><p>While Schadel acknowledges the experimental nature of the pilot, his optimism about its potential to redefine the staffing industry is palpable. This initiative could mark the beginning of a new era in staffing, where AI and machine learning play central roles in meeting the dynamic needs of businesses and workers alike. The implications of this pilot extend beyond Metavesco and its subsidiaries, offering a glimpse into the future of work and the transformative power of technology in traditional industries.</p></p>
