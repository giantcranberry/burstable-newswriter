          <p class='mb-4'><p>Mullen Automotive Inc., a Southern California-based leader in the next generation of commercial electric vehicles (EVs), has successfully navigated through legal challenges by reaching a settlement with GEM Yield Bahamas Limited and GEM Global Yield LLC SCS. This resolution involves the transfer of Mullen's Mishawaka, Indiana manufacturing facility to GEM, effectively satisfying a prior federal court judgment and concluding all related litigation. This strategic move allows Mullen to concentrate its resources and efforts on its core mission: revolutionizing the commercial EV industry.</p><p>Despite the transfer of the 650,000 square feet Mishawaka facility, Mullen's operational capabilities remain robust, with its Tunica, Mississippi plant actively contributing to the company's production goals. Since commencing commercial vehicle production in August 2023, the Tunica facility has played a pivotal role in Mullen's expansion strategy. The company's commitment to innovation and sustainability is further underscored by its vehicles, the Mullen ONE and Mullen THREE, achieving California Air Resource Board (CARB) and EPA certification, thereby making them available for sale across the United States.</p><p>Mullen's advancements in the EV sector are not limited to production and certifications. The company has also secured IRS approval for federal EV tax credits, offering up to $7,500 per vehicle to eligible customers, a significant incentive that enhances the affordability and appeal of its commercial EVs. Additionally, the Tunica facility's designation as a Foreign Trade Zone (FTZ) provides Mullen with a competitive advantage in the global market through benefits like duty deferment and elimination on exported vehicles.</p><p>The expansion of Mullen's commercial dealer network to seven dealers, including the recent addition of Papé Kenworth, ensures comprehensive sales and service coverage across critical U.S. markets. This network expansion, coupled with the company's strategic operational adjustments, positions Mullen as a formidable player in the transition towards sustainable transportation solutions.</p><p>This settlement represents a turning point for Mullen Automotive, eliminating legal obstacles and reinforcing its dedication to leading the commercial EV revolution. With a clear focus on innovation, sustainability, and strategic growth, Mullen is set to make significant contributions to the future of transportation, offering eco-friendly and efficient solutions to meet the growing demand for sustainable commercial vehicles.</p></p>
