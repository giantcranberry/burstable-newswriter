          <p class='mb-4'><p>In an era where the logistics industry grapples with the inefficiencies of last-mile delivery, Better Trucks has emerged as a beacon of innovation with its Checkpoint technology. Awarded the 'Last Mile Innovation of the Year' at the 4th annual SupplyTech Breakthrough Awards, Checkpoint represents a significant leap forward in addressing the perennial issue of incorrect delivery addresses. With the U.S. witnessing approximately 60 million parcels delivered daily and up to three million deliveries failing due to address errors, the implications of this technology are profound.</p><p>Checkpoint's solution is a testament to the power of combining artificial intelligence with human ingenuity. By integrating AI and Google Address Validation, the system automatically verifies and corrects shipping addresses, while a dedicated human team steps in for cases that require further scrutiny. An SMS-based verification system also allows for real-time customer input, ensuring that the delivery process is as seamless as possible. This multilayered approach not only enhances delivery accuracy but also contributes to significant cost savings and improved customer satisfaction by reducing the number of package returns.</p><p>The recognition by SupplyTech Breakthrough Awards underscores the critical role of technological innovation in solving logistical challenges. Bryan Vaughn, Managing Director of the awards, highlighted the transformative potential of Checkpoint, noting its ability to deliver both operational efficiencies and a better customer experience. Mike Koleno, Better Trucks Chief Technology Officer, reflected on the team's commitment to addressing industry-wide problems, with Checkpoint offering a scalable solution that benefits all stakeholders involved.</p><p>Available to all Better Trucks' clients, Checkpoint also offers the option for white-labeling, allowing brands to maintain a consistent identity while enhancing their engagement with customers. This feature, coupled with the technology's proven effectiveness, positions Checkpoint as a game-changer in the logistics sector. As the industry continues to evolve, the success of Checkpoint serves as a compelling example of how innovation can drive meaningful improvements in both business operations and customer satisfaction.</p></p>
