        <p>In a bold move to address urban decline and spur economic growth, Texas cities are increasingly adopting parking reforms, with the Haltom United Business Alliance (HUBA) leading the charge in Haltom City. The alliance highlights the detrimental effects of outdated parking mandates on business development and affordable housing, particularly in older corridors like Denton Highway and NE 28th Street. HUBA advocates for targeted strategies to revitalize these areas, pointing to successful reforms in cities like Houston and Austin, where parking minimum requirements have been eliminated to encourage redevelopment.</p><p>Texas State Representative K. Richardson has proposed a statewide bill, the RESTRICTION ON REGULATION OF MINIMUM PARKING REQUIREMENTS, aiming to prohibit municipalities from enforcing parking space minimums for commercial buildings, with certain exceptions. HUBA Communications Director Joe Palmer and founder Ron Sturgeon emphasize the urgency for Haltom City to adopt similar reforms to combat rising vacancies and attract investment. Resources from the Parking Reform Network, including a Parking Mandates Map, offer guidance for cities considering such changes.</p>

          <p class='mb-4'><p>The movement to eliminate parking minimums in Texas is gaining traction as cities across the state recognize the potential to lower barriers for business development and increase the availability of affordable housing. This shift in urban planning policy is particularly relevant for older urban and suburban areas that have seen a decline in vitality and economic activity. The Haltom United Business Alliance (HUBA) has pointed to the deteriorating condition of older corridors in Haltom City as a clear indication of the need for such reforms.</p><p>Houston, Bastrop, and Austin have already taken significant steps by removing or reducing parking minimums, with other major Texas cities like Dallas, Fort Worth, San Antonio, and El Paso considering similar measures. At the state level, Texas State Representative K. Richardson has proposed legislation to limit municipalities' ability to enforce parking minimums for commercial buildings, signaling a broader acceptance of the need for policy change.</p><p>Joe Palmer, HUBA's Communications Director, emphasizes the importance of comprehensive reforms in Haltom City's older neighborhoods, where vacant buildings could be repurposed for affordable housing or new businesses. Ron Sturgeon, a HUBA founder, criticizes the city's current focus on attracting large businesses to newer areas, arguing that even minor adjustments to parking requirements could quickly benefit the central and southern parts of the city.</p><p>The push for parking reform in Texas is part of a larger trend towards adapting urban planning policies to meet modern challenges. By removing outdated parking mandates, cities are opening the door to new development opportunities and the creation of more sustainable and vibrant communities. This movement not only addresses immediate concerns like vacant properties and affordable housing shortages but also sets a precedent for other states to follow in rethinking the role of parking in urban development.</p></p>
