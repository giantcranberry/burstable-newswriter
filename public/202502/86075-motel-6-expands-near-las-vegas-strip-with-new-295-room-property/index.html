          <p class='mb-4'><p>G6 Hospitality, the parent company of Motel 6, is making a bold move in the hospitality industry with the announcement of a new 295-room property near the Las Vegas Strip, set to open in May 2025. This exterior-corridor hotel, owned by S.R.E Enterprises LLC, marks one of the largest in Motel 6's history and is strategically located just over a mile from the heart of Las Vegas's entertainment district. The property will offer guests modern amenities such as flat-screen TVs, Wi-Fi, free parking, and an outdoor pool, along with private access to the OYO Hotel and Casino, promising a comprehensive travel experience.</p><p>The timing of this expansion aligns with a period of significant tourism growth in Las Vegas, which welcomed approximately 41.7 million visitors in 2024, including 3.4 million in December alone. This surge underscores the city's continued appeal as a premier travel destination, presenting a lucrative opportunity for G6 Hospitality to strengthen its presence in the market.</p><p>In support of its expansion efforts, G6 Hospitality is investing $10 million in marketing to boost customer adoption and brand engagement. The company is focusing on digital innovation, with plans to enhance its website and My6 app, aiming to quadruple app installations before the summer season. Additionally, G6 Hospitality is leveraging advanced digital targeting strategies through partnerships with tech giants like Google and Microsoft, signaling a forward-thinking approach to customer engagement.</p><p>Following its acquisition by OYO, a global travel tech company, from Blackstone Real Estate, G6 Hospitality is pursuing aggressive growth. The company plans to add over 150 hotels in 2025 under the Motel 6 and Studio 6 brands, targeting key markets such as Texas, California, Georgia, and Arizona. This expansion is complemented by a recent partnership with HotelKey, a hospitality technology provider, aimed at upgrading technological capabilities across G6 Hospitality's properties in the United States and Canada.</p><p>The strategic moves by G6 Hospitality come at a time when both Motel 6 and Studio 6 have been recognized for their excellence, with Motel 6 ranking in the top 50 of all franchises in the 2024 Entrepreneur Franchise 500® report. The company's commitment to diversity and innovation has also been acknowledged, earning it a spot as a 2024 Leader in Diversity by the Dallas Business Journal. This expansion near the Las Vegas Strip not only signifies G6 Hospitality's ambitious growth strategy but also highlights the evolving landscape of the hospitality industry, where technology and customer experience are becoming increasingly central to success.</p></p>
