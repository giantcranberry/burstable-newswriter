          <p class='mb-4'><p>Chef Point restaurant in Colleyville is gearing up to provide an unforgettable Father's Day celebration with a meticulously designed menu that aims to honor fathers through the art of culinary excellence. Executive Chef Franson Nwaeze has crafted an exclusive selection of dishes that combine bold flavors, generous portions, and innovative culinary techniques to create a dining experience that stands out.</p><p>The special Father's Day menu features an array of entrees that cater to diverse palates, including the Blackened Smoked Ribeye, enhanced with pecan wood smoke and steak butter, and the Texas Beef Short Ribs, slow-braised in a chipotle Jack Daniels demi-glace and served over creamy jalapeño grits. Seafood lovers are not left out, with options like the Hawaiian Salmon, grilled to perfection with a honey-lime glaze and topped with pineapple salsa.</p><p>Additional highlights include a stuffed chicken or pork chop filled with spinach, artichokes, and feta, alongside a decadent Lobster Bisque rich with tender meat. The menu also brings back crowd-pleasers such as the Texas Bacon Bloody Mary and the Big Daddy Burger, ensuring a comprehensive and satisfying dining experience for all guests.</p><p>This Father's Day event is reservation-only, with service running from 11:00 AM to 8:00 PM, and the regular brunch and dinner menus will not be available during this time. Chef Nwaeze shared that the inspiration behind the menu is to create dishes that 'bring people together—bold, indulgent, and full of heart,' aiming to foster memorable moments and celebrate the significance of paternal relationships through the joy of shared meals.</p><p>Located conveniently near DFW Airport, Chef Point offers a unique setting for families looking to commemorate Father's Day in a special way. This event not only highlights the restaurant's commitment to culinary innovation but also underscores the importance of family and togetherness, making it a noteworthy occasion for business and technology leaders interested in the intersections of culture, hospitality, and experiential dining.</p></p>
