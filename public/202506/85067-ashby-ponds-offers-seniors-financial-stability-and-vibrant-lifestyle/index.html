          <p class='mb-4'><p>Ashby Ponds, an Erickson Senior Living community located in Ashburn, Va., stands out as a beacon of financial stability and lifestyle enrichment for seniors like Frank Doe and Donna Shelton. The community's model, which includes a comprehensive monthly service package, eliminates the unpredictability of homeownership costs such as property taxes and homeowner's insurance. This approach not only simplifies financial planning for residents but also aligns with the findings of a survey commissioned by Erickson Senior Living, which revealed that over 90% of seniors prefer predictable monthly expenses for their daily needs.</p><p>The financial benefits of residing at Ashby Ponds are manifold. Residents enjoy the convenience of having maintenance, utilities, a meal plan, and access to a wide range of amenities included in their monthly package. Frank Doe, a member of the Resident Advisory Council's finance subcommittee, points out the elimination of certain bills and the ease of accessing on-campus dining and transportation services as key advantages. Furthermore, the community's 90% refundable entrance fee policy makes it an accessible option for seniors with varying budgets, as highlighted by Sales Director Elizabeth Freeman.</p><p>Beyond the financial aspects, Ashby Ponds offers a vibrant community life. Residents have the opportunity to engage in fitness activities, cultural events, volunteering, and exploring new hobbies. The community's commitment to enhancing the resident experience is evident in its recent expansions, including new residence buildings and restaurants. Additionally, the Home for Life assurance provides eligible residents with peace of mind, ensuring they can continue to call Ashby Ponds home even if they outlive their financial resources.</p><p>The implications of Ashby Ponds' model are significant for the senior living industry and for seniors nationwide. By addressing the dual needs of financial predictability and lifestyle enrichment, Ashby Ponds sets a benchmark for senior living communities. Its success underscores the importance of understanding and catering to the preferences of seniors, offering a blueprint for how communities can provide both security and quality of life in retirement.</p></p>
