          <p class='mb-4'><p>Silvercorp Metals Inc. has marked a significant achievement in its fiscal 2025 report, announcing record revenues of nearly $299 million. This milestone is a testament to the company's robust performance, with silver production reaching 6.9 million ounces and an 11% year-over-year growth in silver equivalent output. Such figures not only highlight Silvercorp's operational efficiency but also its ability to maintain a low-cost production model, with an all-in sustaining cost of $12.12 per ounce of silver over the past 12 months.</p><p>Financial resilience is at the core of Silvercorp's strategy, evidenced by its $369 million in cash and a strategic equity portfolio. This financial health enables the company to fully fund significant projects like the El Domo copper-gold mine, expected to start production by the end of 2026. The El Domo project is a pivotal part of Silvercorp's expansion and diversification efforts, promising to enhance its market position and contribute to long-term growth.</p><p>Further bolstering its resource base, Silvercorp has updated the mineral resource estimate for the Condor Project, with a revised Preliminary Economic Assessment (PEA) slated for completion by the end of 2025. These initiatives are integral to Silvercorp's strategy of generating shareholder value through free cash flow, organic growth, and strategic acquisitions.</p><p>Silvercorp's commitment to environmental and social governance (ESG) is reflected in its 'A' rating from MSCI ESG. The company prioritizes local employment and procurement, demonstrating its dedication to responsible mining and community engagement. With over 18 years of experience, Silvercorp has developed a diversified portfolio of mining assets and investments across China, Ecuador, and Bolivia, leveraging its expertise to maximize project value.</p><p>The achievements of Silvercorp Metals Inc. underscore the potential of combining responsible mining practices with strategic growth initiatives. As the company continues to advance its projects and achieve financial milestones, its impact on the mining industry and its ability to generate shareholder value remain significant. This story is crucial for business and technology leaders interested in sustainable and profitable mining operations, showcasing how strategic planning and commitment to ESG can drive industry success.</p></p>
