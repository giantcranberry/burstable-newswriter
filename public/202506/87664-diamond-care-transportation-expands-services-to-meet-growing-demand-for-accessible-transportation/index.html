          <p class='mb-4'><p>Diamond Care Transportation has announced a significant expansion of its services, now offering comprehensive paratransit transportation, senior ride services, and wheelchair transportation not only in South Carolina but also extending into Florida, Washington, Maryland, and the District of Columbia. This strategic expansion is designed to address the increasing need for reliable and empathetic transportation solutions for seniors and individuals with disabilities, particularly those requiring mobility assistance and access to disability resources.</p><p>The company has introduced a fleet of wheelchair-accessible vehicles and drivers trained and certified in ADA-compliant transport. Enhanced ride coordination services are now available to facilitate transportation to medical appointments, dialysis, rehabilitation, and other essential disability services. This initiative underscores Diamond Care Transportation's dedication to removing transportation barriers that hinder access to critical healthcare services for vulnerable populations.</p><p>Key aspects of the expanded services include specialized paratransit transportation for individuals with mobility challenges, senior transportation services for medical visits, and solutions aimed at ensuring equitable healthcare access for people with disabilities. The company provides both Medicaid-approved and private-pay options, offering the convenience of scheduling via phone or online with live assistance.</p><p>Furthermore, Diamond Care Transportation is establishing partnerships with local healthcare providers and brokers to streamline the booking process for medical rides across all new service areas. With South Carolina as its primary hub, the expansion into Florida, Washington State, Maryland, and Washington, D.C., represents a significant step forward in making transportation arrangements more accessible for patients, caregivers, and medical facilities alike.</p></p>
