          <p class='mb-4'><p>This Independence Day, a new book titled 'Fractured to Freedom' by Al Perry is set to offer readers a unique perspective on freedom, focusing on personal healing and self-discovery. Launching on July 4th, the book serves as a guide to reclaiming inner peace and achieving vibrant well-being, aligning its release with the symbolic theme of independence.</p><p>'Fractured to Freedom' is structured into nine sections, each aimed at guiding the reader through different facets of holistic healing. Perry combines his personal journey from trauma and addiction to becoming a healer and teacher with actionable tools rooted in ancient Taoist wisdom. The book is designed to be accessible, featuring practical exercises such as journal prompts and meditation techniques, making it a comprehensive toolkit for those seeking to improve their emotional and physical health.</p><p>The timing of the book's release is deeply personal for Perry, who shares that the date represents more than just a national holiday. 'Releasing this on July 4th means something real to me—not because of fireworks, but because I know what it's like to be trapped in your own story and to finally find your way out,' he explains. This message of finding true freedom within oneself resonates throughout the book, offering readers a pathway to liberation from their own personal struggles.</p><p>Early feedback from readers has been overwhelmingly positive, with many praising the book's relatable narrative and the practical steps it provides towards a better life. 'Fractured to Freedom' is emerging as a must-read for individuals on a journey to healing, highlighting the profound impact of silence and self-reflection in achieving personal independence.</p><p>For leaders in the business and technology sectors, 'Fractured to Freedom' presents an opportunity to explore the intersection of personal well-being and professional success. In an era where mental health and self-care are increasingly recognized as critical to productivity and innovation, Perry's book offers valuable insights into achieving a balanced and fulfilling life. Its release is a timely reminder of the importance of inner freedom in fostering creativity, resilience, and leadership in the fast-paced worlds of business and technology.</p></p>
