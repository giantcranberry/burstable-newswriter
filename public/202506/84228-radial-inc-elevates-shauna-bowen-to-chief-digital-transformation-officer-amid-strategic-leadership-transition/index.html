          <p class='mb-4'><p>Radial, Inc., a leading force in eCommerce solutions and part of the bpostgroup, has made a significant leadership announcement with the promotion of Shauna Bowen to Executive Vice President, Chief Digital & Transformation Officer. This strategic elevation is part of Radial's preparation for the retirement of its Chief Technology Officer, Jim French, and underscores the company's commitment to maintaining its edge in the competitive eCommerce landscape.</p><p>Bowen, previously serving as SVP of Strategy & Transformation at Radial, will now lead the Technology, Product, and Transformation teams. Her appointment is seen as a move to harness her proven track record in driving digital innovation, notably through initiatives like the Radial Fast Track fulfillment solution. Since its launch in March, Radial Fast Track has been adopted by seven modern brands, offering a scalable and flexible fulfillment option that ensures delivery speed and service quality are not compromised.</p><p>Jim French, whose retirement marks the end of a significant chapter for Radial, has been pivotal in strengthening the company's technology infrastructure and enhancing system reliability. His leadership has laid a robust foundation for Radial's ongoing and future digital transformation efforts. French has expressed confidence in Bowen's capabilities, particularly her strategic and innovative approach, which has already contributed to the success of Radial Fast Track.</p><p>Under Bowen's stewardship, Radial Fast Track has become a critical solution for retailers facing the challenges of today's logistics environment. It meets the increasing need for cost-effective and adaptable fulfillment options, allowing brands to surpass customer expectations in a fluctuating market. Tom Schmitt, CEO of Radial, commended French's contributions and shared his optimism for Bowen's new role, emphasizing the significance of digital transformation in the evolving eCommerce sector.</p><p>Bowen's promotion is set to take effect on June 6, 2025, coinciding with French's official departure, ensuring a seamless leadership transition. This move highlights Radial's dedication to innovation and its focus on delivering exceptional eCommerce experiences from the initial click to the final delivery. The industry watches closely as Radial embarks on this new phase of growth and digital excellence under Bowen's leadership.</p></p>
