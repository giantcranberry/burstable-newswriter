          <p class='mb-4'><p>Mullen Automotive has taken a decisive step towards strengthening its position in the commercial electric vehicle (EV) market by increasing its ownership in Bollinger Motors to 95%. This move, which adds approximately $3.5 million to shareholder equity, comes after the resolution of legal issues that had previously placed Bollinger under court-ordered receivership. With the receivership case now dismissed, Bollinger is set to operate independently under Mullen's ownership, focusing on the development of its commercial EV lineup, notably the all-electric B4 Chassis Cab.</p><p>The significance of this acquisition extends beyond the immediate financial uplift. It underscores Mullen's commitment to leading the charge in the commercial EV space, leveraging its enhanced ownership to fast-track the B4's development. This is a clear signal to the industry of Mullen's ambition to not only participate in the EV revolution but to drive it forward, particularly in the commercial sector where demand for sustainable transportation solutions is growing.</p><p>Mullen's strategic expansions don't stop at ownership stakes. The company has been actively enhancing its production capabilities across its two U.S.-based plants in Tunica, Mississippi, and Mishawaka, Indiana. The initiation of commercial vehicle production in Tunica, coupled with IRS approval for federal electric vehicle tax credits, positions Mullen as a formidable player in the EV market. Its current lineup, including the CARB and EPA-certified Mullen ONE and Mullen THREE, is already making waves, with the latter benefiting from HVIP approval, offering customers substantial purchase incentives.</p><p>Moreover, Mullen's efforts to expand its commercial dealer network and secure Foreign Trade Zone status for its Tunica plant highlight a comprehensive strategy aimed at not just entering but dominating the commercial EV market. These moves are expected to enhance Mullen's competitive edge, offering both economic and operational advantages that could redefine standards in the industry.</p><p>For business and technology leaders, Mullen's latest developments represent more than just corporate growth; they signal a pivotal shift towards sustainable commercial transportation. The implications are vast, from environmental benefits to economic opportunities, marking a critical moment in the evolution of the EV market.</p></p>
