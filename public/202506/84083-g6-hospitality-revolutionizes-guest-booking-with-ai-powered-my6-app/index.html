          <p class='mb-4'><p>G6 Hospitality, the parent company of Motel 6 and Studio 6, has unveiled a significant upgrade to its My6 app, integrating advanced AI personalization features to transform the guest booking experience. This innovative approach is designed to match guests with properties that best suit their preferences, leveraging a proprietary AI-powered recommendation engine. The move is set to address the common search for 'Motel 6 near me,' ensuring properties are more visible to potential guests and improving occupancy rates.</p><p>The revamped My6 app introduces several key features aimed at enhancing the user experience. These include AI-driven recommendations and lister rankings, a personalized homepage, and a save and compare feature for evaluating properties. Additionally, the app offers enhanced property showcasing with AI-powered amenity tags and an interactive map feature for better navigation and trip planning. These improvements are complemented by an optimized visual presentation, which aims to increase transparency and trust between guests and properties.</p><p>Early adoption of the My6 2.0 app has shown promising results, with a 14% year-over-year increase in direct bookings and a noticeable reduction in reservation process drop-offs. G6 Hospitality has plans for further updates, including AI-driven ranking improvements, additional payment options, and the integration of Tripadvisor reviews, to continue refining the guest experience.</p><p>This development highlights G6 Hospitality's dedication to harnessing technology to not only enhance the guest experience but also support property owners in achieving higher occupancy rates. By prioritizing personalization and efficiency, the My6 app represents a forward leap in the hospitality industry's ongoing digital transformation, setting a new standard for how technology can be used to connect guests with the perfect stay.</p></p>
