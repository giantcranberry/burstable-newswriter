          <p class='mb-4'><p>Telvantis, Inc., previously known as Raadr, Inc. (OTC: $RDAR), has officially transitioned to its new corporate identity, a move that underscores the company's strategic direction and aspirations in the communications technology industry. Effective June 10, 2025, this name change, approved by the Board and Majority Shareholders, is more than a rebranding effort; it represents Telvantis's commitment to innovation and growth in a competitive global market.</p><p>The company has initiated the FINRA Corporate Action submission process to implement its new name and ticker symbol in the market. While the timeline for FINRA's approval is not yet clear, this step is crucial for Telvantis as it seeks to enhance its market visibility and operational identity. Daniel Contreras, CEO of Telvantis, shared his optimism about the name change and the ongoing FINRA process, pointing to the company's strong operational performance and the promising acquisition opportunities ahead, including a notable Memorandum of Understanding with Fortytwo.</p><p>Specializing in high-volume, reliable messaging, voice, and digital communication solutions, Telvantis serves global enterprises across fintech, healthcare, and e-commerce sectors. With its headquarters in Miami Beach, FL, the company leverages its proprietary CPaaS capabilities and extensive carrier relationships to establish a leading position in the communications technology space.</p><p>The announcement also included forward-looking statements, reminding investors of the potential risks and uncertainties that could impact the company's future performance. These statements, based on current expectations and management's assumptions, highlight the challenges of market conditions, competition, and the integration of new operations. Telvantis encourages investors to approach these projections with caution, emphasizing that actual results may vary.</p><p>This corporate name change and strategic focus signal Telvantis's ambition to not only navigate but also shape the future of communications technology. For industry leaders and stakeholders, Telvantis's evolution offers a glimpse into the dynamic nature of the tech sector and the continuous innovation required to stay ahead. As the company moves forward, its actions will likely have implications for competitors, partners, and the broader technology landscape, making this development a noteworthy event for anyone invested in the future of global communications.</p></p>
