          <p class='mb-4'><p>Sandhills Classical Christian School in Pinehurst is setting a new standard for school safety by becoming the first in the region to implement Active Defender's wearable panic buttons. This innovative technology, developed by Jim Boyte, a retired Department of Defense software engineer, is designed to provide instant connections to emergency response systems with a single touch. The school's participation in the School Leadership Safety Summit on June 16 will showcase this system, highlighting its potential to revolutionize campus safety protocols.</p><p>The Active Defender platform has already seen adoption in several schools across North and South Carolina, signaling a growing trend towards leveraging technology for enhanced safety measures. Its ability to facilitate real-time communication during emergencies ensures that educators and staff can act swiftly to protect students. This development is particularly timely, as educational institutions nationwide are actively seeking effective solutions to address escalating safety concerns.</p><p>Recognition of Active Defender's potential came with the awarding of an NC IDEA SEED Grant, which celebrates the system's innovative approach to school safety. The technology, born from the collaboration of former military personnel, security specialists, and software engineers, is built on the principle that no one should be left uninformed during a crisis. The upcoming summit will feature a live demonstration of the system, along with discussions by keynote speakers Rob DePriest and Bobby Brasher on the critical role of real-time communication in safeguarding schools.</p><p>This initiative by Sandhills Classical Christian School and the broader adoption of Active Defender's technology represent a significant advancement in the effort to create safer learning environments. By integrating cutting-edge solutions like wearable panic buttons, schools are taking proactive steps to mitigate risks and ensure the well-being of students and staff. The summit not only serves as a platform for demonstrating this technology but also as a call to action for other institutions to explore innovative safety measures.</p></p>
