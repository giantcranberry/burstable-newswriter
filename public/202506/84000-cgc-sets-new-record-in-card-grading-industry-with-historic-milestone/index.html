          <p class='mb-4'><p>Certified Guaranty Company (CGC) has recently achieved a monumental milestone in the card grading industry, grading an unprecedented 570,000 cards in May 2025. This record, as reported by GemRate.com, not only surpasses the previous record set in April but also highlights CGC's rapid expansion and its growing dominance in the market. The company's introduction of the CGC Pristine 10 label in 2023 has revolutionized the collector's market, with cards receiving this grade experiencing significant value appreciation.</p><p>The impact of CGC's grading standards on the market is undeniable. For instance, an Alpha Black Lotus graded CGC Pristine 10 was sold for $3 million in a private sale in April 2024, showcasing the premium collectors are willing to pay for top-graded cards. Similarly, sports cards graded by CGC, such as a Victor Wembanyama rookie card graded CGC 9.5, have achieved remarkable auction results, further cementing the company's reputation in the industry.</p><p>CGC's growth is not just a testament to its grading standards but also to the booming interest in collectible cards. The company reported a 631% year-over-year increase in sports cards graded and a 146% increase in trading card games (TCGs) in May. Month-over-month, sports cards saw a 474% growth, with TCGs and non-sports cards also experiencing a 26% increase. This surge in grading activity positions CGC to potentially grade an estimated 10 million cards by the end of the year.</p><p>The company's success is attributed to its commitment to fast, accurate, and affordable grading services, making it the preferred choice for collectors globally. With strategic expansions into key markets worldwide, including London, Munich, Hong Kong, Shanghai, and an upcoming office in Dubai, CGC is poised to further its influence and continue setting industry records. This expansion not only benefits collectors by providing easier access to grading services but also signifies the growing global interest in collectible cards as both a hobby and an investment.</p><p>The implications of CGC's record-breaking achievements extend beyond the company itself, reflecting broader trends in the collectibles market. The increasing value of graded cards underscores the importance of professional grading in establishing authenticity and condition, factors that significantly influence a card's market value. For collectors and investors alike, CGC's milestones highlight the potential for substantial returns on investment in graded collectibles, making this news particularly relevant to those interested in the intersection of hobby and investment opportunities.</p></p>
