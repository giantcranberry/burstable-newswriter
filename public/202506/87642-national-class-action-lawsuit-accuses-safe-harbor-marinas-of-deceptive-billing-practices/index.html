          <p class='mb-4'><p>A national class action lawsuit has been filed against Safe Harbor Marinas, LLC and SHM Charleston Boatyard, LLC, accusing them of deceptive corporate practices that allegedly inflated customer invoices through unauthorized charges. The lawsuit, representing Miami Charter Yacht, LLC and affected customers nationwide, was filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of South Carolina Charleston Division. It claims the defendants engaged in 'bait-and-switch' conduct to add improper charges to final bills.</p><p>Cristina Pierson, a Partner at Kelley | Uustal, highlighted that the lawsuit challenges Safe Harbor Marinas' pattern of inflating invoices with charges unrelated to performed work. This issue is compounded by a policy requiring full payment before vessels can leave the marina. With Safe Harbor Marinas operating 138 marinas across approximately 24 states, the lawsuit suggests these practices may have been systematically implemented nationwide.</p><p>The plaintiff, Miami Charter Yacht, LLC, encountered these practices when their 76-foot San Lorenzo yacht, 'Vasiliki', required repairs at Safe Harbor's Charleston facility. The final bill was allegedly inflated by unauthorized surcharges and fees. The lawsuit includes claims for breach of contract, breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, unjust enrichment, and violation of South Carolina's Unfair Trade Practices Act. It seeks damages, restitution, and injunctive relief for the proposed class.</p><p>This legal action underscores the importance of transparency and fairness in corporate billing practices, especially in industries serving both businesses and consumers. The outcome could set a precedent for how similar cases are handled in the future, potentially leading to stricter regulations on billing practices within the marina and broader service industries.</p></p>
