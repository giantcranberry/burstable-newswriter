          <p class='mb-4'><p>Amrize has emerged as an independent, publicly traded entity following its complete separation from Holcim, with its shares now available on the New York Stock Exchange and the SIX Swiss Exchange under the ticker symbol 'AMRZ'. This development marks a pivotal step for Amrize, enabling it to directly engage with the dynamic North American construction market. The company's strategic positioning is supported by enduring trends like infrastructure upgrades and the growing demand for data centers, areas where Amrize is well-equipped to deliver.</p><p>With a significant footprint encompassing more than 1,000 sites across the U.S. and Canada and a dedicated team of 19,000 professionals, Amrize is set to strengthen its role as a key partner for builders. Its diverse portfolio of building solutions addresses a wide range of construction needs, from large-scale infrastructure to residential developments. Jan Jenisch, Chairman and CEO of Amrize, emphasized the company's trajectory towards profitable growth and its leadership in the market, underscoring the potential for creating substantial value for stakeholders.</p><p>The transition to independence was facilitated through a dividend-in-kind distribution, allocating one Amrize share for each Holcim share held as of June 20, 2025. Financially, Amrize stands on solid ground, with reported revenues of $11.7 billion and an Adjusted EBITDA of $3.2 billion in 2024. Looking ahead, the company plans to pursue aggressive investment strategies, explore strategic acquisitions, and focus on maximizing shareholder returns.</p><p>Celebrating this milestone, Amrize's leadership participated in the NYSE opening bell ceremony and embarked on a tour of North American sites to connect with employees. This independence not only opens a new chapter for Amrize but also solidifies its commitment to leading the construction industry in North America, backed by its operational excellence and strategic vision.</p></p>
