          <p class='mb-4'><p>Theoria Medical, a physician-led organization at the forefront of transforming care delivery in post-acute and senior living environments, has significantly strengthened its leadership team with several key appointments. This move underscores the company's commitment to revolutionizing care through innovation, operational excellence, and a steadfast focus on value-based care models. The new leaders bring a wealth of experience and expertise that is expected to propel Theoria Medical towards its vision of creating a more integrated and effective post-acute care delivery platform.</p><p>Among the notable appointments, Brendan McNamara joins as Chief Operating Officer, bringing his extensive background in operational leadership within multi-state care delivery systems. His experience, including roles as Regional President at Main Street Health and CEO of Sound Telemedicine, along with his disciplined leadership approach as a U.S. Army Ranger, positions him uniquely to drive operational efficiencies and unify care delivery across Theoria's network.</p><p>Svetlana Vinokur has been appointed Chief Financial Officer, with her impressive track record in financial planning, capital strategy, and corporate development. Her previous leadership in financial transformation initiatives at VillageMD and NielsenIQ will be invaluable as Theoria seeks to scale its operations and innovate within the post-acute care space.</p><p>Manny Raposo, taking on the role of Chief Growth Officer, brings a proven ability to drive growth and market expansion, as evidenced by his successful tenure as Chief Sales Officer at PharmScript. Kevin Murphy's appointment as Chief of Value-Based Care and his role on Theoria's Board of Directors since January 2025 highlight the company's focus on senior care innovation and the adoption of value-based care models.</p><p>Marcia Siguenza, as the new Chief Human Resources Officer, brings over two decades of experience in physician practice management and HR leadership, ensuring that Theoria's workforce is aligned with its mission of delivering high-quality, patient-centered care.</p><p>Under the leadership of CEO Dr. Justin Di Rezze, Theoria Medical is poised to leverage its physician-led model and proprietary technology to improve care coordination and patient satisfaction. These strategic hires reflect the company's dedication to not only advancing its mission but also setting new standards in post-acute care through scalable, value-based solutions. For leaders in business and technology, Theoria's moves signal a growing emphasis on innovation and efficiency in healthcare delivery, with potential implications for the broader industry and patient outcomes worldwide.</p></p>
