          <p class='mb-4'><p>Bila Solar has taken a significant step forward in the U.S. clean energy sector with the commencement of production at its new Indianapolis factory. This facility, the first of its kind in Central Indiana, is set to become the largest solar panel factory in the region, producing ultra-lightweight solar modules and 550W dual-glass conventional panels. These products are uniquely positioned in the market as they are made with American-made solar cells, qualifying them for the 10% domestic content bonus under the federal Investment Tax Credit (ITC). This policy is designed to incentivize American manufacturing and accelerate the deployment of clean energy solutions.</p><p>The opening of the Indianapolis factory is not just a milestone for Bila Solar but also a beacon for the U.S. clean energy industry. It underscores the potential of domestic manufacturing to strengthen supply chains, create jobs, and promote energy independence. Mick McDaniel, Vice President and General Manager of Bila Solar, highlighted the role of forward-looking policies in achieving this milestone. The factory is expected to create over 75 advanced manufacturing jobs this year, contributing significantly to local economic growth and the development of a skilled clean-tech workforce.</p><p>With production now underway, Bila Solar is initially focusing on ground-mount fixed-tilt and carport applications. The company has ambitious plans to scale its operations, aiming for an annual capacity of 300 megawatts (MW) in Phase 1, with a long-term goal of reaching 1 gigawatt (GW) at full buildout. This expansion comes at a critical time as the demand for U.S.-manufactured solar components is on the rise, driven by developers eager to take advantage of federal incentives and reduce dependency on imported technologies.</p><p>The U.S. solar industry is showing signs of robust growth, with the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) and Wood Mackenzie reporting the addition of 8.6 gigawatts (GW) of new solar module manufacturing capacity in the first quarter of 2025. Despite this progress, the industry faces challenges, including fluctuating federal policies and tariffs on essential materials like steel and aluminum. SEIA president and CEO Abigail Ross Hopper emphasized the need for consistent policies that support domestic manufacturing, pointing to Bila Solar's investment in Indiana as a testament to the sector's potential.</p><p>Bila Solar's initiative is a clear example of how policy and private investment can work together to advance the U.S. clean energy agenda. By reshoring clean energy manufacturing, Bila Solar is not only contributing to the nation's energy independence but also setting a precedent for the industry. This development is a critical step towards a sustainable future, demonstrating the tangible benefits of investing in domestic clean energy manufacturing.</p></p>
