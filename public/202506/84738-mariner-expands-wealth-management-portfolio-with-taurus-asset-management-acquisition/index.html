          <p class='mb-4'><p>Mariner, a prominent national financial services firm, has taken a significant step to enhance its wealth management services by acquiring Taurus Asset Management, a New York City-based firm known for its expertise in managing the wealth of high-net-worth individuals and professional athletes. With approximately $1.4 billion in assets under advisement, Taurus Asset Management brings a specialized focus that complements Mariner's existing offerings, particularly in the niche markets of professional athletes and ultra-high-net-worth families.</p><p>The acquisition, finalized on May 31, 2025, integrates Taurus Asset Management into Mariner's operations, with the Taurus team continuing to serve clients from its Madison Avenue location. This strategic move not only broadens Mariner's service portfolio but also strengthens its competitive edge in the wealth management sector. Clients of both firms stand to benefit from a more comprehensive suite of services, including estate planning, tax preparation, and personal finance management, all under the Mariner brand.</p><p>Brad Peck, founder of Taurus Asset Management, brings over two decades of experience in advising professional athletes to Mariner, enriching the firm's expertise and client relationships. Marty Bicknell, CEO and president of Mariner, highlighted the acquisition as a pivotal enhancement to the firm's capabilities, emphasizing the alignment of values and client service approaches between the two entities. This merger underscores Mariner's commitment to growth and excellence in service delivery, setting a new benchmark in the wealth management industry.</p><p>The implications of this acquisition extend beyond the immediate benefits to Mariner and Taurus clients. It signals a growing trend of consolidation in the wealth management sector, as firms seek to broaden their service offerings and enhance their competitive positioning. For industry leaders and observers, this move exemplifies the strategic importance of specialized expertise and personalized service in attracting and retaining high-net-worth clients. As the wealth management landscape continues to evolve, partnerships like this one between Mariner and Taurus Asset Management are likely to become increasingly common, reshaping the industry's future.</p></p>
