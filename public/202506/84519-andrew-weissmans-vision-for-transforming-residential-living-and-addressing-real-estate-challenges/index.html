          <p class='mb-4'><p>Andrew Weissman, with over 25 years of experience in real estate, currently leads as the Director of North Jersey for JCMLiving, managing 22 residential rental communities. His career, inspired by his grandfather's legacy in housing, focuses on operational excellence and community building. A notable incident involving a tenant's inflatable pool highlights the critical need for detailed lease agreements and proactive management.</p><p>Weissman's leadership philosophy, influenced by Jim Rohn's teachings on the importance of surrounding oneself with the right people, has guided his collaboration with JCMLiving. The Rosera Wesmont project in Wood-Ridge, NJ, a luxury residential community developed on the historic Curtiss-Wright aircraft facility site, stands as a testament to Weissman's vision. This 24-year endeavor transforms industrial land into a modern living space, redefining residential standards in the area.</p><p>Advocating for residents' needs, Weissman addresses pressing issues within the affordable housing system, real estate policies, and overregulation. He calls for systemic reforms to ensure accessibility and fairness in housing. His approach to team building emphasizes trust, growth, and innovation, fostering environments where professionals and residents alike can thrive.</p><p>Weissman's advice for success in real estate revolves around mutual respect, empathy, and a long-term perspective. He envisions a future where residential living incorporates hospitality principles, ensuring every resident feels valued. His insights offer a roadmap for addressing the real estate industry's challenges, making his perspective invaluable for professionals and communities striving for meaningful change.</p></p>
