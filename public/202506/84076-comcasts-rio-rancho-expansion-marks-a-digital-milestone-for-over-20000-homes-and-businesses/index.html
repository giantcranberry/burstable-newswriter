          <p class='mb-4'><p>Comcast has achieved a significant milestone in its Rio Rancho expansion project, now extending its Xfinity and Comcast Business services to more than 20,000 homes and businesses. This expansion is a game-changer for the region, providing high-speed internet, mobile services, and comprehensive business solutions that promise to boost digital connectivity and economic growth.</p><p>Mayor Greggory Hull of Rio Rancho has praised the project's progress, noting its alignment with the community's development goals and the increased options it offers residents for network providers. The completion of over half of the expansion project highlights Comcast's dedication to enhancing the region's digital infrastructure, despite the complexities involved in such large-scale endeavors.</p><p>The benefits of this expansion are manifold. Residents now have access to Xfinity's wide range of products, including internet, video, mobile, voice, and home security services. Meanwhile, local businesses can leverage Comcast Business services, which offer connectivity, communications, and cybersecurity solutions tailored to organizations of all sizes, thereby stimulating economic development.</p><p>Jerry Schalow, President of the Rio Rancho Regional Chamber of Commerce, underscored the importance of high-speed connectivity in driving economic growth, attracting new industries, and supporting educational achievements. Comcast's initiatives, such as Internet Essentials and Lift Zones, further illustrate its commitment to reducing the digital divide and improving community well-being.</p><p>With construction ongoing and expected to conclude by 2026, Comcast is paving the way for a digitally inclusive future in Rio Rancho. Chris Dunkeson, Area Vice President of Comcast, has reiterated the company's focus on providing reliable, fast, and secure internet services that are crucial in today's digital era. This expansion not only connects Rio Rancho to a trusted nationwide network but also introduces advanced residential and commercial solutions, setting a new benchmark for digital accessibility and innovation in the area.</p></p>
