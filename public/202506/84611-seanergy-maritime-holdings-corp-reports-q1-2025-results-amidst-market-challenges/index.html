          <p class='mb-4'><p>Seanergy Maritime Holdings Corp. (NASDAQ: SHIP), a prominent name in the capesize shipping industry, has disclosed its financial outcomes for the first quarter of 2025, revealing a net loss of $6.8 million. This figure marks a significant downturn from the net income of $10.2 million recorded in the corresponding quarter of the previous year. However, the company's adjusted net loss of $5.2 million, or $0.27 per share, notably surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a $0.44 per share loss, continuing its streak of exceeding earnings per share expectations for the fourth consecutive quarter.</p><p>Revenue for the quarter was reported at $24.2 million, a decrease from $38.3 million in Q1 2024, yet it still managed to outdo analyst projections by 3.76%. In a move that underscores its dedication to shareholder value, Seanergy announced its 14th straight quarterly dividend of $0.05 per common share, even as the dry bulk trade experiences its customary seasonal lull.</p><p>Stamatis Tsantanis, Seanergy's Chairman and CEO, pointed to the company's strategic fleet positioning, with 39% of its fleet days for the second quarter secured at an average daily rate of around $22,700. This strategy, coupled with an anticipated blended fleet TCE of over $19,000, hints at a favorable earnings trajectory for the next quarter.</p><p>In related news, United Maritime Corp., a spin-off from Seanergy, has declared its tenth consecutive quarterly cash dividend of $0.01 per share. United Maritime has been broadening its horizons by venturing into offshore energy markets via its ECV joint venture, increasing its equity stake to approximately 30% during the quarter. This expansion is part of a deliberate effort to diversify revenue streams beyond the dry bulk sector, tapping into the growing demand in both traditional offshore energy and renewable sectors.</p><p>Seanergy's recent financial strategies, including securing $88.1 million in new financing and refinancing deals, have bolstered its liquidity, enabling it to leverage the capesize sector's robust long-term outlook. With a substantial portion of its operating days through the end of 2025 already locked in at advantageous rates, Seanergy is poised for future growth, despite the possibility of short-term market fluctuations.</p><p>The company's ability to navigate through a tough market, maintain consistent dividend payments, and expand its fleet underscores its strong standing in the capesize shipping domain, offering a semblance of stability in an otherwise volatile industry.</p></p>
