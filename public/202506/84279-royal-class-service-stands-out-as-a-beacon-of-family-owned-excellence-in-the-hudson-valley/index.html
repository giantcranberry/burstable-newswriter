          <p class='mb-4'><p>In the Hudson Valley, where the home services industry is increasingly controlled by private equity-owned brands, Royal Class Service of New Windsor has been distinguished as the region's leading family-owned and operated company. This recognition, detailed in the Hudson Valley Home Services Report – May 2025, shines a light on the company's dedication to independence and local accountability amidst a trend of consolidation.</p><p>The report, produced by the Hudson Valley Residential Review, highlights the contrast between companies under private equity ownership and those that remain family-run. Royal Class Service's approach, characterized by direct owner involvement, a customer-first culture, and a strong emphasis on local accountability, has differentiated it in areas highly valued by homeowners: trust, responsiveness, transparency, and follow-through. With a Google rating of 4.9 as of May 2025, the company stands out among competitors, including Folkes Home Services, Jones Services, and Astar Heating & Air, which, despite their high ratings, operate under different ownership models.</p><p>Today's homeowners prioritize clear communication, trustworthy technicians, consistent service, quick follow-through, and local accountability—qualities that Royal Class Service exemplifies. Offering a wide range of services such as plumbing, heating, air conditioning, and indoor air quality solutions, the company ensures homes are comfortable, safe, and efficient throughout the year. Their dedication to customer service is demonstrated through 24/7 live phone support, transparent pricing, and the RoyalShield Home Membership Program, which provides perks like priority scheduling and discounts.</p><p>Operating across Orange, Dutchess, Ulster, Putnam, Westchester, and Rockland counties, Royal Class Service has established itself as a dependable and skilled provider in the Hudson Valley. Their philosophy of treating every customer with respect and professionalism has not only garnered high praise in customer feedback but also positioned them as a model of family-owned excellence in an industry moving towards greater consolidation.</p></p>
