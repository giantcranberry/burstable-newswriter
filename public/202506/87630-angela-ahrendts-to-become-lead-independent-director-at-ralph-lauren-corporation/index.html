          <p class='mb-4'><p>Ralph Lauren Corporation has announced a pivotal update to its Board of Directors, with Angela Ahrendts stepping into the role of Lead Independent Director after the Company's 2025 Annual Meeting of Shareholders. Ahrendts, who joined the Ralph Lauren Board in August 2018, brings a wealth of experience as the current chair of the Finance Committee and a member of the Nominating, Governance, and Sustainability Committee. This leadership transition underscores the company's commitment to refreshing its board with diverse perspectives and expertise to navigate the evolving retail landscape.</p><p>The departure of Hubert Joly, who has served on the board for 16 years and as Lead Independent Director since 2021, marks the end of a significant chapter for Ralph Lauren. The company has lauded Joly's contributions, particularly his strategic guidance and embodiment of the brand's core values. Ahrendts's elevation to Lead Independent Director is viewed as a strategic move to leverage her extensive experience in industry innovation and leadership, further strengthening the board's ability to steer the company towards sustained growth.</p><p>President & Chief Executive Officer Patrice Louvet has expressed appreciation for Joly's leadership and welcomed Ahrendts's upcoming role, anticipating her impact in shaping the company's future. The board's composition will adjust to 11 directors following Joly's exit, with Ahrendts's new position taking effect post her re-election at the 2025 Annual Meeting. This development signals Ralph Lauren's proactive approach to governance, ensuring it remains at the forefront of the global fashion industry.
