          <p class='mb-4'><p>The fintech sector is on the brink of a transformative era, with Wallid.co Ltd, a London-based innovator, releasing a comprehensive three-year forecast for AI-powered e-commerce. This forecast not only highlights the rapid evolution of online shopping but also provides a strategic roadmap for merchants and platforms to navigate this changing landscape. Under the guidance of CEO Ilya Mikin, Wallid is pioneering the development of payment and checkout infrastructure designed for the AI-commerce era, where traditional methods are being supplanted by dynamic, conversational interfaces.</p><p>Consumer behavior is shifting unmistakably towards AI-powered shopping, with individuals increasingly turning to AI assistants such as ChatGPT, Gemini, and Perplexity for personalized product recommendations. This trend is accompanied by an expectation for seamless checkout processes within these platforms. Wallid's research points to the rise of 'ask-and-checkout' experiences, marking a significant departure from conventional product discovery and transaction methods. Early integrations, like those between OpenAI and Shopify, along with the adoption of AI agents by industry giants such as Amazon, Google, and TikTok, further validate this trend.</p><p>Wallid's market analysis presents staggering projections for AI-powered shopping, estimating its share of global e-commerce Gross Merchandise Value (GMV) to reach $189 billion by 2025, $630 billion by 2027, and $945 billion by 2028. By 2028, this could represent 15% of all online purchases, signaling a profound shift in consumer expectations and underscoring the urgency for merchants to adapt. The company identifies four critical areas for merchant focus in the AI-commerce era: discovery, personalization, checkout, and retention.</p><p>To address these needs, Wallid has developed an AI-personalized, open-banking powered checkout solution. This innovative offering is designed to provide embedded, context-aware, and effortless payment options, facilitating transactions within chat interfaces and AI agents. Wallid's solution supports real-time contextual adaptations and enables low-cost, high-conversion account-to-account payments. Looking ahead, Wallid envisions a future where intelligent AI agents shop on behalf of consumers, equipped with embedded financial logic for credit scoring, loyalty, and instant offers. Wallid aims to serve as the transactional backbone of this future, establishing itself as the premier infrastructure for AI-optimized payments across diverse platforms and geographies.</p></p>
