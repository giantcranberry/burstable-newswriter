          <p class='mb-4'><p>The rapid growth of electric vehicle (EV) adoption in the United States is outpacing the development of necessary charging infrastructure, largely due to software limitations. Olga Haygood, CEO of S44 Energy, has identified the critical need for open, protocol-compliant software to overcome these challenges, ensuring the charging networks' reliability and scalability for the future.</p><p>Current obstacles include the widespread use of outdated or closed software systems, which limit visibility and complicate necessary upgrades. This reliance on inflexible software not only hampers deployment and customization efforts but also acts as a significant barrier to the industry's progress. Haygood suggests that adopting software compatible with OCPP 2.0.1 could introduce essential features such as Plug & Charge and smart energy management, significantly improving the user experience.</p><p>Reliability issues further exacerbate the situation, with one in five public charging attempts failing across the country. According to Haygood, the absence of real-time operational tools and strict protocol compliance are to blame. She underscores the necessity of monitoring charger health and ensuring seamless operation across various brands and networks to boost reliability.</p><p>On the business front, Charge Point Operators (CPOs) face profitability challenges, attributed to high SaaS subscription fees and inflexible tools that fail to meet evolving needs. Haygood calls for greater cost transparency, operational control, and flexibility to support operators of all sizes in achieving success.</p><p>The OCPP 2.0.1 standard presents a transformative opportunity for the industry, offering advanced functionalities like live diagnostics and secure communications. However, its potential is limited by inconsistent interpretations of the standard and a lack of compliance enforcement. Haygood advocates for stricter standards and increased support for open systems to propel the industry forward.</p><p>EV adoption rates vary widely across the U.S., with charger availability and reliability posing significant concerns, especially in less densely populated areas. Haygood emphasizes the importance of systems that offer real-time visibility and quick fault resolution to foster trust and encourage broader EV adoption.</p><p>As utilities and fleets become more involved in charging infrastructure, their unique requirements highlight the need for modular, API-first software solutions. Such software must support deep customization and robust data integration to meet these players' specific needs.</p><p>With ten years of experience in EV charging software, S44 Energy is at the forefront of addressing these challenges. The company's TopazEV platform, recognized as the industry's first Open-as-a-Service Charge Station Management Software (CSMS), reflects their dedication to creating charger networks that are not only profitable and scalable but also prepared for future demands.</p></p>
