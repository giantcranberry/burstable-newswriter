This leadership duo is poised to propel the company forward, ensuring it remains a key player in the hyperscale data center market. With a robust development pipeline and the backing of AREP's $309 million Fund IV, PowerHouse is well-positioned to meet the future needs of digital infrastructure, particularly in AI and cloud workloads.</p><p>These strategic appointments highlight PowerHouse's proactive approach to leadership and innovation in the hyperscale data center sector.
