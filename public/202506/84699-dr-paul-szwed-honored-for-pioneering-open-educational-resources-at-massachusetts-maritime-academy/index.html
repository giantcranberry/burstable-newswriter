          <p class='mb-4'><p>The Massachusetts Maritime Academy (MMA) has recently celebrated the achievements of Dr. Paul Szwed, a distinguished faculty member in the International Maritime Business department, for his outstanding contributions to the creation and dissemination of Open Educational Resources (OER). His innovative work has not only provided MMA students with free, high-quality educational materials but has also extended these benefits to learners around the globe, marking a pivotal moment in the accessibility of education.</p><p>At the prestigious annual Faculty OER Awards ceremony, organized by the Massachusetts Department of Higher Education’s OER Advisory Council, Dr. Szwed was awarded the 2025 Silver Faculty OER Award. Carolyn Michaud, the MMA Library Director, accepted the award on his behalf, emphasizing the transformative impact of OER on making education more accessible and affordable. Dr. Szwed’s contributions, particularly his development of e-modules and supplementary materials for courses such as Project Management Fundamentals and Supply Chain Management, have resulted in substantial savings for students, amounting to hundreds of dollars each semester.</p><p>This initiative is a testament to MMA’s commitment to fulfilling the curricular needs of both faculty and students while fostering a culture of knowledge sharing for the broader societal benefit. James McKenna, Ph.D., Dean of Undergraduate Studies at MMA, lauded Dr. Szwed’s unwavering dedication to education and his efforts to empower students not only in Massachusetts but worldwide. The availability of these resources through the Open Massachusetts repository represents a significant advancement in the democratization of education, offering unprecedented opportunities for learners everywhere.</p><p>The recognition of Dr. Szwed’s work underscores the growing importance of OER in the educational landscape. By reducing financial barriers and expanding access to quality learning materials, initiatives like Dr. Szwed’s are paving the way for a more inclusive and equitable global education system. This development is particularly relevant for leaders in business and technology, as it highlights the potential of OER to revolutionize how knowledge is disseminated and consumed in the digital age, with far-reaching implications for workforce development and lifelong learning.</p></p>
