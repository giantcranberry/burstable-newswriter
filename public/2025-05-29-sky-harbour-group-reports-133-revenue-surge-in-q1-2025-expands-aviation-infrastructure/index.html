          <p class='mb-4'><p>Sky Harbour Group Corporation (NYSE: SKYH) has announced a remarkable 133% increase in total revenue to $5.6 million for the first quarter of 2025, compared to the same period in 2024. This growth is attributed to new lease commencements and the acquisition of key facilities, marking a significant milestone in the company's expansion within the aviation infrastructure sector.</p><p>The company's strategic initiatives included the commencement of operations at its Phoenix Deer Valley campus and preparations for upcoming openings in Dallas Addison and Denver Centennial. A notable expansion was the addition of a facility at Seattle's Boeing Field, which adds approximately 90,000 square feet of rentable space to Sky Harbour's portfolio. These developments underscore the company's commitment to broadening its national footprint and enhancing its operational capacity.</p><p>With eight operational campuses, one under construction, and ten in pre-development stages, Sky Harbour is solidifying its position in the aviation infrastructure market. The company reported rental revenue of $4.5 million and fuel revenue of $1.1 million, alongside the execution of long-term leases at strategic locations including Boeing Field, Hillsboro, and Stewart International. These achievements reflect Sky Harbour's robust growth trajectory and its ability to capitalize on emerging opportunities in the aerospace and private aviation sectors.</p><p>Financial metrics for the quarter revealed sequential improvements, with gross margins rising to 1.3%. Management's confidence in achieving consolidated run-rate breakeven cash flow and adjusted EBITDA by the end of 2025 is supported by the company's strong liquidity position, with $83.7 million in consolidated cash and restricted cash, and total assets amounting to $553.7 million.</p><p>Stonegate Capital Partners has provided a valuation of Sky Harbour between $14.40 and $22.46 per share, with a midpoint of $17.72, taking into account factors such as discount rates and the company's assumable debt at an estimated blended interest rate of 4.25%. This valuation highlights the potential for Sky Harbour's continued growth and its strategic positioning to leverage market opportunities in the evolving aviation landscape.</p><p>The implications of Sky Harbour's growth extend beyond the company itself, signaling a positive trend in the aviation infrastructure sector. For industry leaders and investors, Sky Harbour's performance offers insights into the potential for expansion and investment in aviation-related infrastructure, underscoring the sector's role in supporting the broader aerospace and private aviation industries.</p></p>
