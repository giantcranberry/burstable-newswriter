        <p>Sonrai Security launches Just-in-Time (JIT) Access, integrating with Amazon Bedrock for AI-powered session summaries of privileged user activities. JIT Access provides temporary, on-demand permissions without proxies, aligning with zero-trust principles. Sonrai's cloud-native solution eliminates standing privileges in production environments, enhancing security and operational agility.</p>

          <p class='mb-4'><p>Sonrai Security has announced a groundbreaking addition to its Cloud Permissions Firewall for AWS, introducing a Just-in-Time (JIT) Access capability that utilizes artificial intelligence to redefine cloud access management. This innovative approach ensures that access permissions are granted temporarily and only when necessary, adhering to the zero-trust security model, which is increasingly becoming a standard in the industry.</p><p>The integration of Amazon Bedrock into Sonrai's solution enables the automatic generation of session summaries, providing organizations with unparalleled visibility into privileged user activities. This feature eliminates the need for manual log reviews, streamlining the security monitoring process and significantly reducing the potential for oversight or error.</p><p>Brendan Hannigan, CEO of Sonrai Security, highlighted the persistent issue of standing access as a major vulnerability in cloud security. The JIT Access solution directly addresses this concern by ensuring that permissions are granted on a need-to-know basis and for the minimal required duration, thereby minimizing the attack surface without compromising operational efficiency.</p><p>What sets Sonrai's solution apart from traditional Privileged Access Management (PAM) tools is its cloud-native architecture, allowing for deployment within hours. The use of Amazon Bedrock facilitates the rapid development of intelligent session summaries, offering immediate insights into elevated access activities. This not only enhances security but also provides a competitive edge by accelerating time to market and enabling flexible, cost-effective AI model deployment.</p><p>Matt Carle, Head of Product at Sonrai Security, pointed out the solution's ability to produce human-readable insights from privileged sessions automatically. This capability represents a significant leap forward in making cloud security more accessible and manageable for organizations of all sizes.</p><p>Currently available for AWS users of the Sonrai Cloud Permissions Firewall, the company has plans to extend its JIT Access capability to Azure and Google Cloud Platform in the near future. This expansion will further solidify Sonrai Security's position as a leader in cloud security innovation, offering comprehensive solutions that address the evolving challenges of cloud computing.</p></p>
