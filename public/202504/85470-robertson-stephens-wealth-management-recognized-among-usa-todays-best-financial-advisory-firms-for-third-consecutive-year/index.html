          <p class='mb-4'><p>Robertson Stephens Wealth Management has once again been honored as one of USA Today's Best Financial Advisory Firms in 2025, securing its position for the third year in a row. This recognition underscores the firm's dedication to excellence and its significant growth in the wealth management sector. Managing over $7 billion in client assets, Robertson Stephens has proven its ability to stand out among 500 evaluated firms nationwide, thanks to its personalized approach to wealth management and robust growth in assets under management.</p><p>The selection process, a collaboration between USA Today and Statista, was rigorous, focusing on client and industry expert recommendations alongside growth in assets under management. With over 30,000 participants in an independent survey, the ranking highlights firms that excel in the financial advisory sector. Robertson Stephens not only made it to the top 20 firms nationwide but also ranked within the top 5 in its assets under management subcategory, a testament to its outstanding performance and client satisfaction.</p><p>Raj Bhattacharyya, CEO of Robertson Stephens, expressed pride in this achievement, emphasizing the firm's commitment to delivering tailored wealth strategies. The firm's financial performance in 2024, with $7.1 billion in advisory assets under management, reflects a 45% growth over the previous year and over 40% growth in the past five years. This growth trajectory is indicative of the firm's strong market position and its ability to adapt to the changing needs of its clients.</p><p>In a strategic enhancement to its services, Robertson Stephens introduced a family office earlier this year, aimed at catering to ultra-high-net-worth clients. This move demonstrates the firm's agility and dedication to addressing the complex needs of its clientele in today's dynamic wealth management landscape. The recognition by USA Today and Statista not only celebrates Robertson Stephens' achievements but also reinforces its reputation as a leader in providing sophisticated, client-centric financial advisory services.</p><p>For business and technology leaders, this news highlights the importance of choosing a wealth management firm that not only understands the intricacies of financial planning but also demonstrates consistent growth and adaptability. Robertson Stephens' recognition serves as a benchmark for excellence in the financial advisory industry, offering insights into the qualities that define top-performing firms in a competitive market.</p></p>
