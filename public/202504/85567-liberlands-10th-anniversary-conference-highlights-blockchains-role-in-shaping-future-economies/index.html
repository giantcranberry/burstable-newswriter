          <p class='mb-4'><p>The Free Republic of Liberland marked its 10th anniversary with a groundbreaking conference that not only celebrated its decade of existence but also set the stage for discussions on the future of decentralized technologies. Held from April 11-13, 2025, at the Liberland Ark Village in Apatin, Serbia, the event was a melting pot of ideas, attracting global leaders, innovators, and blockchain enthusiasts. TRON DAO's gold sponsorship and Justin Sun's keynote address underscored the event's significance in the blockchain and libertarian communities.</p><p>Justin Sun's presentation, "Bridging Nations and Networks: Innovation, Sovereignty, and Global Progress," delved into how decentralized technologies are pivotal in transforming economic landscapes. He drew parallels between Liberland's libertarian ethos and the blockchain ecosystem's focus on individual empowerment and technological progress. This alignment of values highlights a growing trend where digital and physical sovereignties intersect to foster innovation.</p><p>The conference also featured insights from former Ecuadorian President Rosalía Arteaga and libertarian advocate Dr. Ron Paul, showcasing Liberland's rising profile on the international stage. TRON DAO's influence was further cemented by Sam Elfarra's discussion on stablecoins and financial innovation, pointing to the practical applications of blockchain in today's economy.</p><p>Significant announcements from the TRON ecosystem, including the USDD 2.0 upgrade and the introduction of a Gas-Free feature for stablecoin transactions, were highlights of Sun's address. The launch of the T3 Financial Crime Unit, a collaboration with Tether and TRM Labs, represents a proactive step towards ensuring the integrity of digital asset transactions, addressing one of the critical challenges facing the blockchain industry.</p><p>With the TRON blockchain reporting over 300 million user accounts and $20 billion in total value locked, the conference underscored the expanding reach and impact of decentralized technologies. The event was not just a celebration of Liberland's journey but a testament to the potential of blockchain and libertarian principles in solving global challenges, from governance to financial inclusion. As the world grapples with the complexities of digital transformation, Liberland's conference offers a glimpse into a future where technology and liberty converge to create more open and equitable systems.</p></p>
