          <p class='mb-4'><p>Golden Matrix Group Inc. (NASDAQ: GMGI) has taken a significant step towards financial stability and strategic growth by fully repaying its $7.2 million Senior Secured Promissory Note to Lind Global Asset Management VIII LLC. This move, executed using the company's existing cash reserves, not only eliminates a substantial debt but also safeguards current shareholders from potential dilution, a common concern when companies seek to raise capital or settle debts through issuing additional shares.</p><p>CEO Brian Goodman highlighted the repayment as a testament to the company's dedication to fostering long-term shareholder value. This financial milestone is complemented by a recent $9.5 million debt-to-equity conversion by Meridian founders, further enhancing the company's net debt ratio and financial flexibility. Such strategic financial management is pivotal as Golden Matrix Group continues to expand its footprint in the competitive gaming technology sector, both in business-to-business and business-to-consumer markets.</p><p>The company's approach to managing its financial obligations while pursuing growth is evident in its recent acquisition of Meridianbet Group, a move that significantly broadens its international presence. Licensed in 17 jurisdictions across Europe, Africa, and South America, Meridianbet Group's integration into Golden Matrix Group's portfolio underscores the company's ambition to build a diversified and scalable gaming technology empire.</p><p>Transparency and strategic financial planning have been key to Golden Matrix Group's recent successes. The details of the debt repayment were disclosed in a Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, reflecting the company's commitment to regulatory compliance and shareholder trust. By leveraging its strong cash position to settle debts without resorting to equity dilution, Golden Matrix Group not only demonstrates its financial health but also positions itself as a resilient player in the global gaming technology industry.</p><p>This development is crucial for investors and industry observers alike, as it signals Golden Matrix Group's ability to navigate financial challenges while aggressively pursuing expansion opportunities. The company's strategic moves, including debt repayment and acquisitions, are likely to have a lasting impact on its market position, operational scalability, and ability to innovate in the fast-evolving gaming technology landscape.</p></p>
