          <p class='mb-4'><p>Accredited Solutions (OTC: ASII) is making significant strides in the financial technology sector, with a clear focus on e-gift cards and blockchain-based payments. The company's ambitious strategy includes a planned Nasdaq listing through a Letter of Intent with Everest Consolidator Acquisition Corporation, a move expected to bolster its market credibility and access to capital. This development comes at a time when the global gift card market is on a rapid ascent, projected to grow from over $500 billion in 2023 to surpass $700 billion by 2027, alongside the blockchain payments sector which is expected to expand from $10 billion in 2024 to over $60 billion by 2030.</p><p>The company's growth trajectory is underscored by its financial performance, with revenue per share witnessing a tenfold increase from $0.0011 in 2023 to $0.0119 in 2024. Accredited Solutions is optimistic about its fiscal outlook, anticipating net earnings of more than $2.5 million for 2024 and forecasting an impressive $85 million in revenue for 2025. A key component of its strategy is the proposed acquisition of ItsBChain, a blockchain infrastructure company, aimed at creating a unified, blockchain-powered e-gift solution in a market that currently lacks cohesion.</p><p>CEO Eduardo Brito emphasized the strategic benefits of the Nasdaq uplisting, including a potential 50% reduction in listing time without the need for a reverse stock split, allowing the company to retain its name and ticker symbol. The acquisition of ItsBChain is seen as a pivotal step towards leveraging scalable blockchain technology to enhance Accredited Solutions' fintech distribution channels, thereby establishing a leadership position in digital gifting and embedded payment solutions.</p><p>Accredited Solutions' approach is characterized by a commitment to responsible capital management and balance sheet transformation, designed to attract institutional financing and unlock significant shareholder value. With the current valuation presenting an attractive entry point for investors, the company is poised for a transformative phase ahead of its Nasdaq listing and the integration of ItsBChain's technology. This strategic move not only highlights Accredited Solutions' ambition to dominate the fintech space but also signals the growing importance of blockchain technology in reshaping the future of digital payments and gifting solutions.</p></p>
