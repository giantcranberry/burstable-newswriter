          <p class='mb-4'><p>Silver Crown Royalties Inc. has made a significant move to strengthen its financial reserves by acquiring 1,000 ounces of physical silver. This strategic purchase, completed at an average price of $30.65 per ounce, not only represents an 8% discount to the 20-day volume-weighted average price but also an 11% discount to recent market highs. The total investment amounted to US$30,650, based on a spot price of US$30.15 per ounce plus a modest premium of US$0.50 per ounce. The physical silver is set to be stored with Money Metals Depository LLC, with the exact location to be confirmed.</p><p>Peter Bures, the Chief Executive Officer of Silver Crown Royalties, highlighted the company's strategic rationale behind this acquisition. By converting a portion of their cash reserves into physical silver, the company aims to maintain a prudent working capital position while diversifying away from traditional currency holdings. This move is particularly significant for a silver royalty company, as it provides a natural hedge against potential currency devaluation, aligning with the company's broader strategy to minimize economic risks and maximize shareholder returns.</p><p>This acquisition marks a strategic pivot for Silver Crown Royalties, which currently holds four silver royalties, three of which are already generating revenue. The decision to convert cash received from PPX into physical silver bullion underscores the company's commitment to financial flexibility and tangible asset value. This approach not only reflects the company's confidence in the enduring value of silver but also its proactive stance in safeguarding investor interests against the backdrop of fluctuating currency values and economic uncertainties.</p><p>The implications of this strategic acquisition extend beyond Silver Crown Royalties Inc., offering insights into how companies in the precious metals and mining sectors are adapting to global economic challenges. By prioritizing tangible assets and financial prudence, Silver Crown Royalties sets a precedent for how businesses can navigate the complexities of today's economic landscape, ensuring resilience and long-term growth.</p></p>
