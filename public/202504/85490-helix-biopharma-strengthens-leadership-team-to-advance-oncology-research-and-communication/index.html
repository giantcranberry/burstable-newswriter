          <p class='mb-4'><p>Helix BioPharma Corp. has taken significant steps to reinforce its leadership team with the appointment of Veronika Kandziora as Chief Operating Officer and Dr. Jessica Kourniaktis as Director of Communications. These strategic hires are poised to propel the company's oncology research and communication strategies forward, marking a pivotal moment in Helix BioPharma's mission to develop treatments for hard-to-treat cancers.</p><p>Veronika Kandziora brings to the table over two decades of leadership experience across the biopharma, financial, and consulting sectors. Her previous role as Corporate Secretary and strategic consultant to Helix, combined with her expertise in international finance and compliance, positions her uniquely to steer the company towards operational excellence and strategic alignment. Kandziora's profound understanding of regulatory and governance environments is expected to enhance Helix's capability to navigate the complex landscape of oncological drug development.</p><p>Dr. Jessica Kourniaktis, with her rich background in academic research and strategic communications, is set to elevate Helix's public engagement efforts. Her experience in founding a boutique consultancy and serving in executive roles within biopharma startups underscores her ability to blend analytical depth with compelling storytelling. Dr. Kourniaktis's approach is anticipated to effectively communicate the scientific and therapeutic potential of Helix's innovative oncology treatments to a broader audience.</p><p>CEO Thomas Mehrling highlighted the critical role these appointments play in advancing the company's objectives. With Kandziora's operational leadership and Kourniaktis's strategic communications, Helix is better equipped to tackle the challenges of developing treatments for CEACAM6-expressing solid tumors. The company's lead candidate, Tumour Defence Breaker™ L-DOS47, represents a promising avenue in neutralizing tumor microenvironments and boosting anti-cancer immunity, underscoring the importance of these leadership enhancements.</p><p>These appointments underscore Helix BioPharma's dedication to not only advancing its oncology research but also to improving how it communicates its breakthroughs and visions. In the fiercely competitive and rapidly evolving field of oncological drug development, strengthening operational capabilities and public engagement strategies is paramount. Helix's move signals a clear commitment to making significant strides in cancer treatment, with potential implications for patients, healthcare providers, and the biopharma industry at large.</p></p>
