          <p class='mb-4'><p>Fully Promoted, a leader in the promotional products distribution industry, recently commemorated its 25th anniversary at its annual convention in Fort Worth, Texas. The event not only celebrated a quarter-century of entrepreneurial success but also set the stage for the company's future direction, including a groundbreaking partnership with the Advertising Specialty Institute (ASI). This collaboration will introduce Fully Promoted franchise owners to ASI's ESP+ platform, leveraging AI technology to revolutionize product searches and customize webstores, thereby enhancing sales efficiency and customer engagement.</p><p>The convention, themed 'Trailblazers,' underscored Fully Promoted's commitment to innovation and growth. President Andrew Titus shared insights into the brand's performance in 2024 and unveiled strategic initiatives aimed at sustaining growth into 2025 and beyond. CEO Ray Titus's keynote address further emphasized the importance of sales expansion, strategic pricing, and the pursuit of ambitious goals, challenging franchise owners to exceed their limits.</p><p>A highlight of the event was the awards ceremony, which honored exceptional franchise owners, including Michelle Bottino as Mentor of the Year and Donnie and Celeena Bedore as Humanitarian of the Year. The induction of several franchisees into the Millionaires Club showcased the tangible success achievable within the Fully Promoted network.</p><p>With around 270 locations globally, Fully Promoted is not just reflecting on its past achievements but is also keenly focused on the future. The partnership with ASI and the adoption of AI-powered tools represent a significant leap forward in the company's mission to support entrepreneurs and set new industry standards. As Fully Promoted looks ahead, its vision for the next 25 years is clear: to continue leading the promotional products industry through innovation, strategic growth, and an unwavering commitment to its franchise owners' success.</p></p>
