          <p class='mb-4'><p>Verizon has announced a bold expansion of its consumer business strategy, introducing a series of innovative guarantees aimed at delivering unmatched value and predictability to its customers. This move positions Verizon as a pioneer in the telecommunications sector, offering a suite of benefits that span across its mobile and home network plans, thereby redefining the consumer experience in the industry.</p><p>At the heart of Verizon's new strategy are three groundbreaking initiatives. The first is the introduction of a three-year price lock guarantee on all myPlan and myHome network plans, a first in the industry. This guarantee ensures that customers will enjoy consistent pricing for core monthly services, with the price lock automatically resetting whenever a plan is modified. This initiative is designed to provide customers with financial predictability and peace of mind in an often volatile market.</p><p>Secondly, Verizon is rolling out a free phone and home router guarantee, a significant perk for both new and existing customers. Under this guarantee, customers can trade in devices from leading manufacturers like Apple, Google, or Samsung and receive a free phone, irrespective of the traded device's condition. Additionally, every myHome plan will now include a home internet router at no extra cost, further enhancing the value proposition for Verizon's customers.</p><p>The third pillar of Verizon's strategy focuses on delivering multiple savings opportunities to its customers. This includes free satellite text messaging on qualifying devices and the chance to save over 40% on popular streaming services such as Netflix, Max, Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN+. Moreover, customers who bundle myPlan and myHome services will benefit from additional monthly discounts, making Verizon's offerings even more attractive.</p><p>Verizon's Chairman and CEO, Hans Vestberg, underscored the strategic significance of this transformation, stating that the company is committed to redefining its relationship with consumers by leveraging its industry-leading network and innovative offerings. Sowmyanarayan Sampath, Verizon Consumer CEO, echoed this sentiment, emphasizing the company's focus on delivering customer-centric value through control, simplicity, and unprecedented benefits.</p><p>This comprehensive strategy underscores Verizon's dedication to enhancing customer retention, fostering sustainable revenue growth, and generating long-term shareholder value. By offering predictable pricing, complimentary devices, and extensive savings opportunities, Verizon is setting itself apart in a fiercely competitive telecommunications landscape, promising a brighter, more predictable future for its customers.</p></p>
