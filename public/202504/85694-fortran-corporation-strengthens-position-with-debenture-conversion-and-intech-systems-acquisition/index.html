          <p class='mb-4'><p>Fortran Corporation has taken significant steps to solidify its standing in the telecommunications industry through the successful conversion of a convertible debenture and the acquisition of Intech Systems of South Carolina. These strategic moves are poised to enhance the company's financial stability and expand its service offerings, marking a pivotal moment in its growth trajectory.</p><p>Kent Greer, President and CEO of Fortran Corporation, underscored the debenture conversion's role in bolstering the company's balance sheet by eliminating interest payments and streamlining its debt structure. This financial maneuver is expected to provide Fortran with greater flexibility to invest in innovation and expansion efforts.</p><p>The acquisition of Intech Systems is equally transformative, offering Fortran Corporation access to enhanced capabilities and a wider array of solutions to address the dynamic needs of its customers. Greer highlighted the strategic value of this acquisition, noting its potential to unlock new market opportunities and resources for the company.</p><p>Specializing in cloud-based and AI services, Fortran Corporation is at the forefront of designing, implementing, and maintaining sophisticated telecommunications solutions. The company's comprehensive service portfolio, which includes engineering and design, network services, and remote monitoring, positions it as a key player in the industry.</p><p>While optimistic about the acquisition's ability to increase its market share in the Southeast and boost revenue, Fortran Corporation remains cognizant of the challenges ahead. Market volatility, competitive pressures, and the lingering effects of the COVID-19 pandemic are among the risks that could impact the company's growth plans.</p><p>These developments reflect Fortran Corporation's dedication to adaptability and expansion in the fast-changing telecommunications technology landscape. By strengthening its financial foundation and broadening its service capabilities, the company is well-equipped to navigate the complexities of the industry and seize new opportunities for growth.</p></p>
