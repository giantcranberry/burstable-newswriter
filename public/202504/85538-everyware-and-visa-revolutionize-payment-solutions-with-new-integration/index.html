Additionally, the platform's centralized management tool allows for remote updates and configurations, streamlining the management of payment activities and terminal fleets through an intuitive dashboard.</p><p>Austin Talley, Founder and CEO of Everyware, highlighted the importance of this integration, noting that it represents a significant step forward in providing integrated payment solutions. The pre-certified, pre-integrated card readers are designed to meet the needs of diverse payment environments, from traditional countertop setups to mobile, portable, and unattended settings. This versatility is further enhanced by the solution's connection to Visa Platform Connect, offering businesses access to over 250 acquirers worldwide and leveraging Visa's value-added services to modernize payments infrastructure.</p><p>This integration underscores Everyware's commitment to delivering innovative, secure, and scalable payment technologies.
