          <p class='mb-4'><p>Aston Bay Holdings Ltd. has recently filed its initial NI 43-101 technical report for the Storm Copper Project, located in the Nunavut region of Canada, revealing a Mineral Resource Estimate (MRE) that positions the project as a significant player in the copper exploration sector. The report details indicated resources of 8.2 million tonnes at 1.47% copper and inferred resources of 3.3 million tonnes at 1.30% copper across six deposits, with over 90% of the metal accessible through open-pit mining, primarily as high-grade chalcocite.</p><p>The geological openness of all six deposits presents a substantial opportunity for future resource expansion, a prospect further bolstered by recent high-grade discoveries. This potential for growth not only enhances the project's appeal but also underscores the strategic importance of the Storm Copper Project in meeting global copper demand, a critical component in various industries including renewable energy and electric vehicles.</p><p>Aston Bay has outlined a Preliminary Economic Assessment for the third quarter of 2025, supported by a funding package that could cover up to 80% of initial development costs. This level of financial backing reflects strong confidence from investors and the industry in the project's viability and its potential to contribute significantly to the copper supply chain.</p><p>Developed in collaboration with American West Metals Limited, the Storm Copper Project allows Aston Bay to mitigate upfront financial risks while retaining a considerable stake in the venture. This joint venture model exemplifies a strategic approach to resource development, balancing risk and reward in the highly capital-intensive mining sector.</p><p>The Storm Copper Project's strategic location in Nunavut, combined with its high-grade copper potential, positions Aston Bay Holdings Ltd. as a key contributor to Canada's mineral exploration and mining industry. The project's development could have far-reaching implications, not only for the local economy but also for the global copper market, at a time when demand for this essential metal is on the rise.</p></p>
