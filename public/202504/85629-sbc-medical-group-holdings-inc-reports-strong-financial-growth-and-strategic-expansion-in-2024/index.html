          <p class='mb-4'><p>SBC Medical Group Holdings Inc. has reported a notable financial performance for the year 2024, with a 6% increase in revenue to $205 million and an 18% surge in net income to $47 million. This growth comes amidst a highly competitive landscape in the aesthetic medical industry, underscoring the company's robust operational strategies and market positioning.</p><p>The company expanded its clinic network by adding 43 new locations in 2024, bringing its total to 251 clinics across Japan. This expansion was complemented by a 15% growth in annual patient visits and a customer repeat rate exceeding 70%, reflecting strong brand loyalty and service quality. CEO Yoshiyuki Aikawa emphasized the company's focus on developing a solid franchising structure and exploring international expansion opportunities as key drivers of future growth.</p><p>The global cosmetic surgery and procedure market, valued at $156.39 billion in 2024, is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 14.7% through 2030. SBC Medical is strategically addressing market challenges by enhancing accessibility to aesthetic medicine and differentiating its services through advanced treatments and competitive pricing. The company is also tapping into emerging market segments, such as male aesthetic procedures, where demand is growing faster than in traditional female-focused services. Medical hair removal, in particular, has been identified as a potential growth area due to increasing male interest in aesthetic treatments.</p><p>With $125 million in cash reserves, SBC Medical is eyeing potential acquisitions in aesthetic medicine and adjacent healthcare fields. The company's expansion strategy includes venturing into orthopedics, ophthalmology, fertility treatments, and hair loss interventions. Wall Street firm Sidoti projects a 10% year-over-year revenue growth to $223 million in 2026 and anticipates the clinic network to expand to 300 locations. SBC Medical's adaptive franchise model, featuring more flexible fee structures, is designed to support franchisee success in the competitive market, further solidifying its position as a leader in the aesthetic medical industry.</p></p>
