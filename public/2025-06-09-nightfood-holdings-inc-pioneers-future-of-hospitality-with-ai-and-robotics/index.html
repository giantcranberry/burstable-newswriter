          <p class='mb-4'><p>Nightfood Holdings Inc. (OTCQB: NGTF) is making significant strides in the hospitality industry by embracing automation and artificial intelligence (AI) to address some of the sector's most pressing challenges. The company's recent $36.93 million Letter of Intent (LOI) to acquire the Hilton Garden Inn in Rancho Mirage, California, adjacent to Disney’s upcoming Cotino residential resort community, marks a pivotal step in its strategy to lead the hospitality sector into a new era of automation.</p><p>This acquisition follows Nightfood's $41 million deal for the Victorville Holiday Inn, envisioned as a flagship for robotics-enabled hotel operations. By acquiring Future Hospitality Ventures, which has an exclusive U.S. partnership with Bear Robotics, and integrating Skytech Automated Solutions, Nightfood is doubling down on its commitment to AI-powered robotics. These moves are not just about expanding its portfolio but are a clear response to the hospitality industry's labor shortages and the need for scalable, cost-effective solutions to enhance operational efficiency and guest experiences.</p><p>The implications of Nightfood's aggressive expansion into automation and robotics are profound. As the company strengthens its market position and moves towards a successful uplisting, its initiatives could serve as a model for the global hospitality industry. The integration of AI and robotics into hotel operations offers a viable solution to streamline services, reduce costs, and improve guest satisfaction, setting a new standard for the industry.</p><p>With the combined value of its recent acquisitions, Nightfood is not just investing in properties but in the future of hospitality.
