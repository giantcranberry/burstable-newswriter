          <p class='mb-4'><p>UGI Utilities, Inc. has initiated a comprehensive gas main replacement project in Easton, marking a significant step towards upgrading the local natural gas infrastructure. This initiative is designed to improve the safety and reliability of gas services, with the added benefit of potentially enabling more residents and businesses to convert to natural gas. The project, set to run until the end of August, will primarily affect South 15th Street, Lehigh Street, and South Cherry Street, leading to expected traffic disruptions, road closures, and detours during weekdays from 7 am to 5 pm.</p><p>The areas most impacted by the construction include South 15th Street between Elm Street and Lehigh Street, Lehigh Street between South 15th Street and South 12th Street, and South Cherry Street between Lehigh Street and Spruce Street. Local residents and businesses should prepare for parking restrictions and possible temporary service interruptions as the work progresses. UGI has also indicated that property access might be required for equipment inspection and relighting, emphasizing the project's importance for maintaining high safety standards.</p><p>This infrastructure upgrade is part of UGI Utilities' broader commitment to modernizing its natural gas distribution network. By replacing outdated gas mains, the utility not only aims to enhance service reliability and safety but also to expand natural gas access to more customers. The project underscores the critical role of infrastructure investment in ensuring the long-term sustainability and efficiency of energy services, with potential benefits for the local economy and environment through increased natural gas adoption.</p><p>The completion timeline for the project may be subject to adjustments based on weather conditions and the pace of ongoing work. Despite the temporary inconveniences, the long-term advantages of this upgrade—ranging from improved safety to the possibility of more residents and businesses benefiting from natural gas—highlight its significance for the Easton community and the utility sector at large.</p></p>
