          <p class='mb-4'><p>The Copper Property CTL Pass Through Trust has officially released its final Federal income tax information for the year 2024, marking a significant update for investors and stakeholders. This release, which supersedes the preliminary draft report from February 13, 2025, serves as the authoritative financial record for the trust's earnings and distributions last year. The trust, a key entity formed in the wake of J.C. Penney's Chapter 11 reorganization, plays a pivotal role in managing and liquidating a portfolio of 160 retail properties and 6 warehouse distribution centers acquired during the process.</p><p>Managed by an affiliate of Hilco Real Estate LLC, with GLAS Trust Company LLC acting as trustee, the trust's structure as a liquidating entity has specific tax implications that investors need to navigate carefully. The recent documentation underscores the importance of certificateholders consulting with their tax advisors to understand the nuances of their distributions. While the trust provides these detailed financial records, it explicitly states that the information should not be taken as direct tax advice, highlighting the complexity of tax planning in such investment vehicles.</p><p>This update is not just a routine financial disclosure; it represents a critical piece of information for investors tracking the progress of assets from one of the most notable retail bankruptcies in recent history. The trust's forward-looking statements, included in the release, also draw attention to potential risks and uncertainties that could affect future performance. These factors, detailed in the trust's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, remind investors of the volatile nature of real estate and retail investments, especially those tied to restructuring scenarios.</p><p>For business and technology leaders, especially those with interests in real estate investment trusts (REITs) and the retail sector, the Copper Property CTL Pass Through Trust's latest tax information offers insights into the financial health and operational strategy of a significant player in the post-bankruptcy real estate market. The trust's efforts to efficiently liquidate its properties could signal broader trends in how distressed retail assets are managed and repurposed in a rapidly evolving market landscape.</p></p>
