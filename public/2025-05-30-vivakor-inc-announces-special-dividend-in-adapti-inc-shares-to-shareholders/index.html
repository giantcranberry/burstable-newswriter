          <p class='mb-4'><p>Vivakor, Inc. (NASDAQ: VIVK) has taken a significant step towards enhancing shareholder value by approving a special dividend payable in shares of Adapti, Inc., a technology firm in which Vivakor holds a 13.5% stake. This move is set to distribute approximately 0.0079 Adapti shares for each Vivakor share owned, with an estimated current valuation of $815,000. The dividend excludes shares held by the company's CEO and CFO, who have voluntarily waived their participation rights.</p><p>Adapti, Inc., formerly known as Scepter Holdings, is making waves in the technology sector with its proprietary AdaptAI platform. The company's recent achievement of SEC-reporting status in 2024 marks a pivotal moment in its growth trajectory, signaling its emergence as a noteworthy player in the tech industry. This special dividend by Vivakor not only highlights its strategic investment in Adapti but also offers its shareholders a unique opportunity to gain direct exposure to the potential upside of Adapti's innovative technologies.</p><p>Vivakor, primarily recognized for its leadership in sustainable energy transportation and remediation services, operates one of the largest oilfield trucking service fleets in the continental United States. The company's decision to distribute Adapti shares as a dividend reflects its broader corporate strategy of diversifying its portfolio and investing in sectors with high growth potential, such as technology, while continuing to strengthen its core energy services business.</p><p>This strategic dividend distribution underscores Vivakor's commitment to creating and delivering value to its shareholders through innovative means. By providing shareholders with shares in Adapti, Vivakor is not only diversifying its investment portfolio but also enabling its investors to partake in the potential growth of a promising technology company. This move could have significant implications for shareholders, offering them a stake in a sector that is increasingly becoming a cornerstone of global economic growth.</p><p>The announcement of this special dividend is a testament to Vivakor's forward-thinking approach and its ability to identify and capitalize on opportunities beyond its traditional energy sector focus. As the company prepares to announce the official record date for the dividend in the coming weeks, shareholders and industry observers alike will be watching closely to see how this strategic move plays out in the dynamic interplay between the energy and technology sectors.</p></p>
