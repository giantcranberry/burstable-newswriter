          <p class='mb-4'><p>Royalty Management Holding Corporation has taken a significant step towards reinforcing its commitment to shareholder value by announcing the launch of its inaugural quarterly cash dividend program. Starting June 30, 2025, the company will distribute an annual dividend of $0.01 per share, paid in quarterly increments of one-fourth of a cent per share. This move underscores the company's robust cash-generating performance from its core assets and its strategic approach to capital allocation.</p><p>Chief Executive Officer Thomas Sauve highlighted the dividend program as a reflection of the company's strong financial position and its dedication to returning value to shareholders. The program is designed with flexibility in mind, allowing for future adjustments based on portfolio performance and evolving market conditions. Shareholders of record on specific dates—June 30, September 30, December 31, 2025, and March 31, 2026—will benefit from the quarterly dividends, which will be paid within 45 days following the end of each quarter.</p><p>The introduction of the dividend program is a testament to Royalty Management Holding Corporation's balanced strategy of rewarding shareholders while retaining the capacity for strategic investments and potential stock repurchases. Sauve also pointed out the company's continuous exploration of larger cash flow generating opportunities that could further accelerate business growth. As a royalty company specializing in high-value assets across resource-driven and emerging technology sectors, this initiative marks a pivotal moment in its journey towards sustainable shareholder value creation through prudent financial management.</p><p>This development is particularly noteworthy for investors and industry observers, as it signals the company's confidence in its financial stability and growth prospects. The dividend program not only enhances the attractiveness of Royalty Management Holding Corporation's stock but also sets a precedent for how royalty companies can balance immediate shareholder returns with long-term strategic investments. In a broader context, this move could inspire similar companies to adopt dividend policies, thereby increasing the appeal of the royalty business model to a wider investor base.</p></p>
