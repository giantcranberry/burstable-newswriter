          <p class='mb-4'><p>Wytec International has taken a significant step forward in enhancing public safety with the initiation of sales for its artificial intelligence-powered gunshot detection system. This development comes under a newly awarded multi-state government Master Services Agreement (MSA) through the TXShare Cooperative Purchasing Program. The agreement opens the door for Wytec to provide its cutting-edge technology to a broad spectrum of public sector organizations, including transit authorities, water utility boards, police departments, school districts, and hospitals across over 170 U.S. cities, 50 counties, and 40 special districts.</p><p>The technology at the heart of this initiative is Wytec's smart sensors and private LTE technology, which have demonstrated remarkable accuracy in laboratory testing. With a 94% true positive and 95% true negative detection rate, Wytec's system stands out as one of the most precise gunshot detection solutions available today. This level of accuracy is crucial for minimizing false alarms and ensuring that resources are deployed efficiently in response to actual threats.</p><p>Behind the scenes, Wytec's strategic partnership with Lemko Corporation plays a pivotal role. Lemko, known for its expertise in mobile edge computing and wireless network technologies, provides the secure and reliable infrastructure necessary for the deployment of Wytec's smart sensor systems. This collaboration underscores the importance of robust technological foundations in the development of advanced public safety solutions.</p><p>In an effort to showcase the capabilities of its system, Wytec plans to offer "no-cost" proof-of-concept demonstrations to select TXShare members. These demonstrations will utilize the FCC's Citizens Broadband Radio Service frequency, highlighting the system's versatility and effectiveness. A newly assembled sales team of over 100 national and international agents will spearhead outreach efforts, aiming to bring this innovative technology to government authorities far and wide.</p><p>The implications of Wytec's gunshot detection system extend beyond immediate public safety benefits. By integrating AI-driven sensors with advanced wireless networking, the technology promises to reduce response times and enhance community security in a tangible way. Furthermore, Wytec's ambitions to uplist to the Nasdaq Capital Markets reflect confidence in the system's market potential and the broader impact of its technological innovations on the public safety landscape.</p><p>This initiative represents a notable advancement in the intersection of technology and public safety, offering municipalities and public institutions sophisticated tools to address the challenge of gun violence. As Wytec moves forward with its plans, the potential for its technology to make a meaningful difference in communities across the United States is both significant and inspiring.</p></p>
