          <p class='mb-4'><p>During a recent interview on the New York Stock Exchange floor, Donald Owens, Chairman and CEO of HNO International, detailed the company's pioneering strategy in hydrogen energy. With 19 patents under its belt, HNO International is pushing the boundaries of hydrogen technology, aiming to decentralize production and make clean energy more accessible worldwide. Owens highlighted the company's vision for 'anywhere and everywhere' power, a concept that could redefine energy accessibility and sustainability.</p><p>HNO International's portfolio includes groundbreaking technologies like the Scalable Hydrogen Energy Platform (SHEP™), Compact Hydrogen Refueling System (CHRS™), and Mobile Hydrogen Refueling System (MHRS). These innovations are designed to overcome current hurdles in hydrogen production and distribution, offering scalable solutions for businesses and communities. The company's focus on decentralized production models presents a significant shift from traditional energy systems, promising greater flexibility and resilience in energy supply.</p><p>Owens' expertise as a patent attorney has been crucial in navigating the complex landscape of hydrogen technology development. His leadership underscores HNO International's commitment to addressing the technical and logistical challenges that have hindered wider adoption of hydrogen energy. By presenting their vision on such a prominent platform as the NYSE, HNO International is signaling its ambition to lead the charge in the clean energy transition.</p><p>The implications of HNO International's approach are far-reaching. For industries reliant on fossil fuels, the shift to hydrogen could mean a substantial reduction in carbon emissions and operational costs. For communities, especially those in remote or underserved areas, decentralized hydrogen production offers a path to energy independence and security. As the world grapples with the urgent need for sustainable energy solutions, HNO International's innovations could play a pivotal role in shaping the future of global energy systems.</p></p>
