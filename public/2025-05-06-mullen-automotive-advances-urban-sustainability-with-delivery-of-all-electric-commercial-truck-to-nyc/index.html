          <p class='mb-4'><p>Mullen Automotive Inc. has taken a significant step forward in promoting urban sustainability with the delivery of an all-electric commercial truck, the Bollinger B4, to the Lower East Side Ecology Center in New York City. This Class 4 electric vehicle, funded by the NYC Council, is equipped to support composting and environmental programs, showcasing the potential for electric vehicles in urban environmental services.</p><p>The Bollinger B4 boasts a 158-kWh battery and an impressive 185-mile range, designed to meet the rigorous demands of urban operations. Its features include a 16-foot dry box and a power lift gate, enhancing its utility for ecological and municipal tasks. This delivery not only represents the LES Ecology Center's first foray into electric vehicle use but also underscores a broader shift towards sustainable transportation in urban settings.</p><p>Mullen Automotive's commitment to the electric vehicle market is evident through its production centers in Tunica, Mississippi, and Mishawaka, Indiana. The company has achieved notable milestones, including the commencement of commercial vehicle production in August 2023 and receiving IRS approval for federal EV tax credits by September 2023. Its product lineup, featuring the Mullen ONE and Mullen THREE, both certified by the California Air Resource Board and EPA, is now available across the United States.</p><p>Expanding its commercial dealer network to include seven dealers, such as Papé Kenworth, Mullen Automotive is strengthening its sales and service coverage in key U.S. markets. Additionally, the Foreign Trade Zone status awarded to its Tunica manufacturing center offers strategic advantages, including duty deferment and the elimination of export duties, further solidifying the company's position in the competitive electric vehicle industry.</p><p>This development is not just a win for Mullen Automotive but also for urban centers striving for sustainability. The adoption of electric commercial vehicles like the Bollinger B4 can significantly reduce carbon emissions, contributing to cleaner air and a healthier environment in densely populated areas. For businesses and municipalities, the shift to electric vehicles represents both an environmental responsibility and a practical solution to meet the growing demand for sustainable urban logistics.</p></p>
