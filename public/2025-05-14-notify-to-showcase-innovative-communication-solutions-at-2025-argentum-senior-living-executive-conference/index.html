          <p class='mb-4'><p>Notify, a leader in communication solutions for senior living environments, is set to make a significant impact at the 2025 Argentum Senior Living Executive Conference & Expo in Tampa, Florida. By co-exhibiting with WearTech at Booth #1239, Notify will introduce two innovative products designed to revolutionize communication within senior living communities. This event, taking place from May 19-21 at the Tampa Convention Center, serves as a pivotal platform for Notify to demonstrate how technology can address the pressing communication challenges faced by the senior care industry.</p><p>The Notify Overlay and the Notify Communications App stand at the core of the company's offerings. The Notify Overlay is a sophisticated software platform that seamlessly integrates with over 25 nurse call systems, offering standardized alerts, push-to-talk communication, and comprehensive analytics. On the other hand, the Notify Communications App replaces outdated radio systems with a secure, WiFi-based, hands-free communication solution accessible via smartphones. These technologies are not just about upgrading communication; they're about transforming the operational efficiency of senior living communities without the need for complete system overhauls.</p><p>Greg Robertson, Senior Vice President at Notify, highlights the company's commitment to providing flexible, scalable solutions that meet the evolving needs of senior living operators. By offering pilot programs, Notify enables operators to assess the effectiveness of these technologies in their specific environments before committing to full-scale implementation. This approach underscores Notify's understanding of the industry's need for gradual modernization with minimal disruption.</p><p>The implications of Notify's technologies extend beyond mere operational improvements. By enhancing communication between caregivers and streamlining response times, these solutions have the potential to significantly improve the quality of care provided to seniors. In an industry where efficient communication can directly impact resident safety and satisfaction, Notify's innovations represent a critical step forward. The 2025 Argentum Senior Living Executive Conference & Expo offers a unique opportunity for industry leaders to explore how Notify's solutions can address their most pressing challenges, marking a pivotal moment in the evolution of senior living care.</p></p>
