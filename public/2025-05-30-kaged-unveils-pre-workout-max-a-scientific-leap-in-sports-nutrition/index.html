          <p class='mb-4'><p>Kaged, a leader in sports nutrition, is revolutionizing the pre-workout supplement market with the introduction of Pre-Workout MAX. This new product, set to launch nationwide at The Vitamin Shoppe in August, incorporates two pioneering ingredients, MAXCatalyst™ and TriBsyn™, designed to elevate athletic performance while addressing common user discomforts.</p><p>MAXCatalyst™, a patented black pepper extract, stands out for its ability to enhance the absorption of key ingredients such as caffeine, creatine, and L-citrulline. This innovation not only promises to deliver clean energy but also aims to minimize the jitters often associated with pre-workout supplements, offering users improved mental focus.</p><p>TriBsyn™, another groundbreaking component, is a novel form of beta-alanine that significantly reduces the tingling sensation many users experience. Brian Rand, Head of Product Development at Kaged, highlights that TriBsyn™ achieves a 4x increase in absorption over traditional beta-alanine, enabling lower dosages without compromising on performance benefits. This advancement represents a critical step forward in making pre-workout supplements more user-friendly without sacrificing efficacy.</p><p>Ken Wolf, President and COO of Natural Alternatives International, underscores the importance of TriBsyn™ as a breakthrough that marries effectiveness with user comfort, potentially setting a new standard in supplement design. Pre-Workout MAX will debut in Blue Raspberry and Watermelon flavors, adhering to Kaged's commitment to natural ingredients and rigorous testing, including Informed Sport certification for banned-substance testing.</p><p>The launch of Pre-Workout MAX underscores Kaged's dedication to leveraging scientific innovation to meet the evolving needs of athletes and fitness enthusiasts. By focusing on both performance enhancement and user experience, Kaged is not just introducing a new product but is also contributing to the broader conversation about the future of sports nutrition. This development is poised to have a significant impact on the industry, offering a glimpse into how scientific advancements can lead to more effective and comfortable supplements for serious athletes.</p></p>
