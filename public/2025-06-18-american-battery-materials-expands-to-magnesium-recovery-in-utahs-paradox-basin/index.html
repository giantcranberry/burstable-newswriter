        <p>American Battery Materials, Inc. (ABM) is broadening its strategic extraction efforts to include magnesium recovery at its flagship project in Utah's Paradox Basin, alongside its lithium operations. This move is part of ABM's commitment to supporting the U.S. energy transition by developing a domestic supply chain for critical minerals. The Paradox Basin, known for its lithium deposits, also boasts significant magnesium concentrations, presenting a dual opportunity for ABM. Utilizing advanced Direct Lithium Extraction (DLE) techniques, ABM aims to co-extract these minerals with minimal environmental impact, emphasizing sustainability and efficiency. CEO David E. Graber highlights the growing demand for lightweight metals in industries such as defense, aerospace, and automotive, underscoring the importance of magnesium in national competitiveness and sustainability. Magnesium, recognized as a critical material by U.S. government agencies, plays a key role in electric vehicles, electronics, and medical implants. ABM's innovative approach includes a closed-loop extraction system that minimizes land use and avoids traditional mining methods, aligning with its sustainable practices ethos.</p><p>ABM, headquartered in Greenwich, Connecticut, is focused on the exploration and development of battery materials essential for the global energy transition. The company's strategic initiatives and partnerships are geared towards delivering value to stakeholders while adhering to environmental and sustainability standards.

          <p class='mb-4'><p>American Battery Materials, Inc. (OTC PINK: BLTH) has taken a significant step forward in the critical minerals sector by expanding its strategic extraction focus to include magnesium recovery at its flagship project in Utah's Paradox Basin. This development is crucial for diversifying the United States' supply of essential minerals, particularly for the defense, aerospace, and automotive industries, where magnesium's lightweight properties are in high demand.</p><p>The Paradox Basin is renowned for its substantial lithium deposits and is also rich in magnesium. With mineral rights covering 743 claims across 14,260 acres, American Battery Materials is set to utilize advanced Direct Lithium Extraction (DLE) techniques for the co-extraction of both lithium and magnesium. This innovative approach not only optimizes the use of available resources but also supports environmental sustainability by reducing land disturbance and avoiding traditional, more invasive mining practices.</p><p>David E. Graber, CEO of American Battery Materials, highlighted the strategic significance of this expansion, noting the importance of establishing a domestic magnesium supply chain for national competitiveness and sustainability. Magnesium has been classified as a critical material by the U.S. Department of Energy and the Department of Defense, reflecting its essential role in various applications, including electric vehicles, electronics, and biodegradable medical implants.</p><p>The company's dedication to sustainable practices is demonstrated through its closed-loop extraction system, which ensures that most of the extracted brine is returned to its source. This method markedly decreases the environmental impact of mineral extraction, pioneering a new benchmark for responsible resource development. As the worldwide demand for lightweight metals grows, American Battery Materials' initiative is a pivotal move towards ensuring a sustainable and competitive position for the U.S. in the global energy transition.</p></p>
