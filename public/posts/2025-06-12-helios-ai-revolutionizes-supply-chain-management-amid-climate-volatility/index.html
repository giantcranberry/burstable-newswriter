        <p>Francisco Martin-Rayo, CEO of Helios AI, shares insights into the genesis and mission of the world's leading climate risk platform in a revealing Q&A. With a background that spans startups, digital transformation consulting, and even an avocado importing business, Martin-Rayo, alongside co-founder Eden Canlilar, a former Google senior AI engineer and Abie Award winner, founded Helios AI to tackle the unpredictable nature of today's supply chains. The platform leverages AI to forecast agricultural disruptions and commodity prices, offering companies a much-needed edge in navigating climate volatility, geopolitical tensions, and shifting consumer demands.

          <p class='mb-4'><p>In the face of increasing climate volatility and geopolitical tensions, traditional supply chain models are becoming increasingly inadequate. Helios AI, co-founded by Francisco Martin-Rayo, is pioneering a solution that leverages artificial intelligence to predict agricultural disruptions and commodity prices with remarkable accuracy. This innovation is not just a technological breakthrough; it's a necessary tool for businesses striving to adapt to the unpredictable impacts of climate change on global supply chains.</p><p>The 2025 Spring growing season highlighted the urgent need for such solutions, as extreme weather conditions across the United States disrupted planting schedules and crop yields. These disruptions not only strain the agricultural sector but also lead to higher prices and shortages for consumers. Helios AI's platform, trained on billions of data points, enables companies to foresee and mitigate these crises months in advance, offering a significant competitive advantage.</p><p>What sets Helios AI apart in the crowded AI market is its focus on delivering tangible impacts. Beyond technological innovation, the company aims to equip businesses with practical tools to address the immediate challenges posed by climate change. From optimizing irrigation to forecasting crop failures and rerouting logistics, Helios AI demonstrates how artificial intelligence can provide pragmatic solutions to complex problems.</p><p>Francisco Martin-Rayo's diverse background in finance, consulting, and AI has been instrumental in shaping Helios AI's mission. His vision for the company is rooted in the belief that technology should solve real-world challenges. Strategically based in Washington D.C., Helios AI is positioned at the intersection of policy and global trade, enabling it to influence critical decisions on climate strategy and resilience.</p><p>As the world continues to grapple with the escalating effects of climate change, Helios AI's work offers a forward-looking approach to supply chain management. By harnessing the power of AI to predict and mitigate disruptions, the company not only safeguards businesses' financial health but also contributes to the stability and sustainability of the global economy. In an era marked by uncertainty, Helios AI stands as a testament to the transformative potential of technology in addressing some of the most pressing challenges of our time.</p></p>
