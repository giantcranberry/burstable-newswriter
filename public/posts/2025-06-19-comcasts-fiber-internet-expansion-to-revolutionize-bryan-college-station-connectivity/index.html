        <p>Comcast will connect 70,000 new homes and businesses in Bryan-College Station to fast, secure and reliable, fiber Internet. This expansion into the region will enhance digital infrastructure, promote economic growth and position residents and local businesses for success in an increasingly digital world. The multi-year network expansion brings <a href="https://www.xfinity.com/overview">Xfinity</a> and <a href="https://business.comcast.com/">Comcast Business</a> Internet, mobile, entertainment and security services to the two cities for the first time.</p><p>The multiphase project includes building a new technology hub that will act as “the brain” of the network, supporting all Xfinity and Comcast Business services. Comcast will also install more than 1,000 miles of fiber lines – enough to span the distance from the Brazos Valley to Universal Studios in Florida. The tech leader also plans to open an interactive Xfinity retail store, which will be announced later.</p><p> </p><p>"Bryan-College Station is a hotbed for innovative technology, and this investment by Comcast will help our region stay competitive,” College Station Mayor John Nichols said. “Reliable broadband access is essential for our growing community, from the tens of thousands of Aggie students who call College Station home to our creative business community. Investing in strong connectivity ensures everyone has the advanced resources they need to thrive in a digital world." </p><p> </p><p>“We are grateful that Comcast is making this multimillion-dollar fiber infrastructure investment in our community,” City of Bryan Mayor Bobby Guiterrez said. “This investment in connectivity strengthens our local economy and helps our residents thrive. Expanding reliable high-speed Internet in Bryan will open doors for students, businesses and families. It will enhance opportunities and improve quality of life.” </p><p> </p><p>Residents can visit ComcastTexas.com/BCS for additional details on construction expectations and upcoming service availability. Portions of the project are currently under construction. Comcast’s most recent expansion to Bryan-College Station is part of the company’s $1.6 billion investment in technology and infrastructure in Texas over the last three years. </p><p> “Expanding fiber Internet in communities like Bryan-College Station will be a catalyst for economic growth, enhancing educational opportunities and helping residents and businesses have the tools they need to thrive in the digital age,” Nicolas Jimenez, Comcast’s General Market Manager of Bryan-College Station said. “By investing in the infrastructure and connectivity of these communities, we’re empowering individuals and businesses to succeed and pave the way for a brighter, more connected future."</p><p><b>A Network You Can Trust to be Reliable, Fast and Secure</b></p><p>Comcast’s state-of-the-art network is built to enable residents and businesses to thrive in today’s constantly connected world.
