        <p>Comcast will connect 70,000 new homes and businesses in Bryan-College Station to fast, secure and reliable, fiber Internet. This expansion into the region will enhance digital infrastructure, promote economic growth and position residents and local businesses for success in an increasingly digital world. The multi-year network expansion brings <a href="https://www.xfinity.com/overview">Xfinity</a> and <a href="https://business.comcast.com/">Comcast Business</a> Internet, mobile, entertainment and security services to the two cities for the first time.</p><p>The multiphase project includes building a new technology hub that will act as “the brain” of the network, supporting all Xfinity and Comcast Business services. Comcast will also install more than 1,000 miles of fiber lines – enough to span the distance from the Brazos Valley to Universal Studios in Florida. The tech leader also plans to open an interactive Xfinity retail store, which will be announced later.</p><p> </p><p>"Bryan-College Station is a hotbed for innovative technology, and this investment by Comcast will help our region stay competitive,” College Station Mayor John Nichols said. “Reliable broadband access is essential for our growing community, from the tens of thousands of Aggie students who call College Station home to our creative business community. Investing in strong connectivity ensures everyone has the advanced resources they need to thrive in a digital world." </p><p> </p><p>“We are grateful that Comcast is making this multimillion-dollar fiber infrastructure investment in our community,” City of Bryan Mayor Bobby Guiterrez said. “This investment in connectivity strengthens our local economy and helps our residents thrive. Expanding reliable high-speed Internet in Bryan will open doors for students, businesses and families. It will enhance opportunities and improve quality of life.” </p><p> </p><p>Residents can visit ComcastTexas.com/BCS for additional details on construction expectations and upcoming service availability. Portions of the project are currently under construction. Comcast’s most recent expansion to Bryan-College Station is part of the company’s $1.6 billion investment in technology and infrastructure in Texas over the last three years. </p><p> “Expanding fiber Internet in communities like Bryan-College Station will be a catalyst for economic growth, enhancing educational opportunities and helping residents and businesses have the tools they need to thrive in the digital age,” Nicolas Jimenez, Comcast’s General Market Manager of Bryan-College Station said. “By investing in the infrastructure and connectivity of these communities, we’re empowering individuals and businesses to succeed and pave the way for a brighter, more connected future."</p><p><b>A Network You Can Trust to be Reliable, Fast and Secure</b></p><p>Comcast’s state-of-the-art network is built to enable residents and businesses to thrive in today’s constantly connected world.

          <p class='mb-4'><p>Comcast's ambitious plan to extend its fiber internet infrastructure to Bryan-College Station marks a pivotal moment for the region's digital and economic landscape. This multiyear initiative will connect approximately 70,000 homes and businesses to Xfinity and Comcast Business services, introducing high-speed, reliable internet to an area previously underserved in terms of advanced digital connectivity. The project includes the construction of a new technology hub and the installation of over 1,000 miles of fiber lines, a testament to the scale of Comcast's investment in the community.</p><p>The implications of this expansion are far-reaching. For residents, the availability of multi-gigabit internet speeds with 99.9 percent reliability means enhanced opportunities for remote work, education, and entertainment. Businesses, on the other hand, stand to benefit from Comcast Business's flexible connectivity solutions, which can support operations of all sizes, fostering innovation and competitiveness in a digital economy. Local government leaders, including College Station Mayor John Nichols and Bryan Mayor Bobby Guiterrez, have lauded the project for its potential to improve quality of life and stimulate economic growth.</p><p>Moreover, Comcast's commitment to economic mobility through programs like Internet Essentials ensures that the benefits of this digital transformation are accessible to low-income households, bridging the digital divide. The project aligns with Comcast's broader $1.6 billion investment in Texas's technology and infrastructure over the past three years, underscoring the company's role in driving the state's digital advancement. Nicolas Jimenez, Comcast's General Market Manager for Bryan-College Station, emphasizes the project's role as a catalyst for economic growth, enabling individuals and businesses to thrive in an increasingly digital world.</p><p>This expansion not only represents a significant leap forward in Bryan-College Station's digital infrastructure but also sets a precedent for how private investment can play a crucial role in community development and economic resilience. The project's focus on supporting essential services, including hospitals, schools, and first responders, further highlights its importance in ensuring the community's safety and well-being in the digital age.</p></p>
