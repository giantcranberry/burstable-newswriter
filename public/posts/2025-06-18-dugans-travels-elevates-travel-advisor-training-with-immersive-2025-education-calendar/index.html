          <p class='mb-4'><p>Dugan's Travels is revolutionizing the way independent travel advisors are trained with its 2025 education calendar, focusing on immersive, experiential learning. This initiative is designed to equip advisors with firsthand knowledge of travel products and destinations, ensuring they can offer unparalleled service to their clients. The program's unique approach combines destination experiences, supplier interactions, and professional development, marking a significant shift in how travel professionals are educated.</p><p>Starting the year with a bang, advisors participated in a Virgin Voyages Seminar at Sea aboard the Valiant Lady in January, which included a hotel inspection in Key West. This dual focus on cruise and land-based travel provided agents with a comprehensive understanding of both sectors. February's familiarization trip to Hawaii's premier resorts on Oahu and Maui further enriched advisors' ability to craft multi-island itineraries, a skill highly valued by travelers seeking diverse experiences.</p><p>The agency's commitment to continuous learning was evident in April, with back-to-back cruise experiences on Celebrity Silhouette and Royal Caribbean. These seminars allowed advisors to gain in-depth industry knowledge through direct engagement, enhancing their ability to recommend the best options to clients. Upcoming events, including DU Seattle in July and DU Anaheim in September, promise to further this mission with ship inspections, networking opportunities, and interactive supplier workshops.</p><p>Dugan's Travels supports over 350 independent agents nationwide, offering competitive commissions, weekly supplier webinars, and access to an exclusive Agent Community. The agency's innovative programs, such as the Adventure League and Inner Circle Supplier program, underscore its dedication to advisor growth and success. Recognized by leading industry organizations, Dugan's Travels has earned prestigious accolades, reflecting its excellence and leadership in the travel industry.</p><p>This forward-thinking approach to professional development comes at a critical time as the travel industry evolves. By prioritizing experiential, hands-on training, Dugan's Travels is not only enhancing the capabilities of individual advisors but also setting a new benchmark for the entire industry. This initiative is a testament to the agency's commitment to excellence and its role in shaping the future of travel advising.</p></p>
