        <p>LaFleur Minerals Inc. (CSE: LFLR) (OTCQB: LFLRF) (FSE: 3WK0) has announced an ambitious 5,000-meter diamond drill program at its Swanson Gold Project in Québec's Abitibi Gold Belt, aiming to capitalize on promising exploration results. The project, supported by over 50 identified drill targets from geophysical surveys and high-grade grab samples, marks a significant step towards restarting its 100%-owned Beacon Gold Mill by early 2026. The company has also welcomed Peter Espig, a seasoned mining executive, as a Strategic Advisor to bolster project funding and expansion efforts. With advanced discussions with institutional and private equity groups underway, LaFleur is poised to finance the Beacon restart, estimated at C$5–6 million, targeting near-term cash flow through bulk sampling and toll milling.</p> <p>LaFleur Minerals is dedicated to developing district-scale gold projects in the Abitibi Gold Belt, with the Swanson Gold Project and the Beacon Gold Mill at the forefront of its mission. The Swanson Gold Project, encompassing 16,600 hectares, is rich in gold and critical metals, benefiting from strategic land consolidation and accessibility. The Beacon Gold Mill, capable of processing over 750 tonnes per day, is set to play a pivotal role in processing mineralized material from Swanson and offering custom milling services to nearby projects.

          <p class='mb-4'><p>LaFleur Minerals Inc. has announced a significant 5,000-meter diamond drill program at its Swanson Gold Project in Québec's Abitibi Gold Belt, marking a pivotal step in the company's exploration and development efforts. This initiative is backed by promising exploration results, including high-grade grab samples reaching up to 11.7 g/t Au, and is a key component of LaFleur's strategy to recommission its fully owned Beacon Gold Mill by early 2026.</p><p>The company has meticulously identified over 50 drill targets through extensive geophysical surveys and soil sampling, highlighting the Swanson Gold Project's substantial potential. To further strengthen its project funding and expansion initiatives, LaFleur has brought on board Peter Espig as Strategic Advisor. Espig's deep expertise in capital markets and mill operations is anticipated to be instrumental in driving the company's strategic goals forward.</p><p>Currently, LaFleur is engaged in advanced discussions with institutional and private equity groups to secure the estimated C$5–6 million required for the Beacon Mill's restart. This endeavor is not just about revitalizing the mill but also about generating immediate cash flow through bulk sampling and toll milling, setting a significant milestone in LaFleur's growth narrative.</p><p>Spanning approximately 16,600 hectares, the Swanson Gold Project benefits from its strategic location near Val-d’Or, Québec, with road access and a rail line traversing the property. This advantageous positioning not only facilitates the project's development but also provides direct access to several nearby gold mills. The Beacon Gold Mill, with a processing capacity exceeding 750 tonnes per day, is envisioned to serve dual purposes: processing mineralized material from the Swanson project and undertaking custom milling operations for adjacent gold projects.</p><p>LaFleur Minerals Inc.'s latest developments underscore its dedication to propelling district-scale gold projects within the Abitibi Gold Belt, with a clear focus on creating enduring value through its resource-stage Swanson Gold Project and the Beacon Gold Mill. The company's strategic efforts to amass a significant land package along a major structural break further emphasize the critical role of its operations in the region's mining landscape.</p></p>
