        <p>DB Schenker and Microsoft Cloud Logistics are joining forces to reduce carbon emissions in transportation and logistics. This collaboration will focus on the use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) and Sustainable Marine Fuel (SMF), as well as the development of best-in-class logistics warehouses and the implementation of alternative energy trucks. The partnership aims to significantly lower the environmental impact of their operations and support their sustainability goals.</p><p>The CEO of DB Schenker, Jochen Thewes, emphasized the importance of the cooperation in demonstrating CO2e-savings in intercontinental supply chains, while Cliff Henson, CVP of Microsoft Cloud Supply Chain, highlighted their commitment to setting industry standards in sustainable logistics. The use of Sustainable Aviation and Maritime Fuels is expected to reduce CO2e-emissions by at least 15,000 t per year, with additional efforts involving the use of Hydrogenated Vegetable Oil (HVO) for ocean shipments and the introduction of HVO100 fueling stations and electric vehicles for land transport in Europe and North America.</p><p>The collaborative efforts also include the design of advanced logistics warehouses that prioritize energy efficiency and environmental impact reduction. Achieving LEED Platinum-certification in the United States and BREEAM Certificate Level “Excellent” in the Netherlands, these warehouses signify a significant step towards sustainable and innovative logistics solutions.</p><p>About DB Schenker: With a global presence in over 130 countries, DB Schenker is a leading logistics service provider dedicated to investing in sustainable transport solutions and low-emission products.</p>

          <p class='mb-4'><p>The logistics sector in Texas is on the brink of a sustainable transformation, thanks to a pioneering collaboration between DB Schenker and Microsoft Cloud Logistics. This partnership is set to introduce low-carbon transportation solutions and environmentally friendly logistics practices, marking a significant step forward in the industry's efforts to combat climate change. By focusing on Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) and Sustainable Marine Fuel (SMF), alongside the development of eco-friendly logistics warehouses and the deployment of alternative energy trucks, the initiative promises to reduce carbon emissions substantially.</p><p>DB Schenker estimates that the adoption of sustainable fuels will lead to an annual reduction of at least 15,000 tonnes of CO2e emissions. This ambitious goal underscores the companies' commitment to environmental sustainability and aligns with their broader objectives to minimize Scope 3 emissions in the logistics sector. The collaboration not only highlights the feasibility of significant CO2e savings in today's intercontinental supply chains but also sets a new benchmark for environmental responsibility in the industry.</p><p>Beyond fuel alternatives, the partnership is making strides in the development of advanced logistics warehouses. Achievements such as the LEED Platinum certification of a facility in Illinois and the BREEAM Excellent certification of a warehouse in the Netherlands reflect the companies' dedication to energy efficiency and environmental stewardship. These milestones are indicative of the potential for sustainable infrastructure to redefine logistics operations worldwide.</p><p>The initiative also extends to land transportation, with DB Schenker implementing Hydrogenated Vegetable Oil (HVO) for ocean shipments from California to Texas and expanding its use of HVO100 fueling stations and electric vehicles in Europe and North America. These efforts demonstrate the comprehensive approach the partnership is taking to address sustainability across all modes of freight.</p><p>The collaboration between DB Schenker and Microsoft Cloud Logistics is more than just a step towards reducing the logistics industry's carbon footprint; it's a blueprint for the future of global trade and transportation. As companies increasingly seek to align with environmental sustainability goals, this partnership serves as a compelling example of how innovation and cooperation can lead to meaningful change. The implications for Texas, a hub for logistics and transportation, are profound, offering a glimpse into a more sustainable and environmentally responsible future for the industry.</p></p>
