        <p>Hibbett, in partnership with Nike, celebrated the launch of <a href="https://www.hibbett.com/blog-sports-lifestyle/theorigin.html">The Origin</a> with Duncanville High School alum and point guard for the Orlando Magic, Anthony Black, with a $50,000 donation to <a href="https://dhs.duncanvilleisd.org/">Duncanville High School</a> boys and girls basketball programs as part of their new philanthropic initiative, First String. The Origin is an original mini-series exploring the stories behind emerging talent in sports and culture, highlighting the drive, resilience, and support systems that fuel their journeys. Hibbett and Nike gathered with the Duncanville High School boys and girls basketball team members yesterday in Texas to unveil Anthony Black’s inaugural episode of The Origin. The boys and girls basketball programs received a donation of $50,000 as part of the program and one student from each of the teams will be granted with scholarship funding for four years and Hibbett internship opportunities in their corporate headquarters in Birmingham, Alabama.</p>

          <p class='mb-4'><p>The partnership between Hibbett and Nike has taken a significant step forward with the announcement of Duncanville High School's boys and girls basketball programs as the latest recipients of the First String initiative. This philanthropic effort is designed to empower the next generation of student-athletes by providing substantial financial support and career development opportunities. The $50,000 donation to Duncanville High School's basketball programs underscores the commitment of both companies to fostering athletic and academic excellence among young athletes.</p><p>During a celebratory event marking the launch of The Origin, a mini-series featuring Duncanville alum and Orlando Magic point guard Anthony Black, the First String initiative was highlighted as a means to make a lasting impact on student-athletes. The program not only offers financial assistance to the school's basketball programs but also awards scholarships to one student from each of the boys' and girls' teams. These scholarships cover four years of education, coupled with internship opportunities at Hibbett's corporate headquarters in Birmingham, Alabama, providing a unique pathway for career development.</p><p>Sarah Wangaard, Hibbett Vice President of Marketing, emphasized the significance of the initiative, linking it to Anthony Black's journey to the NBA and the potential it holds for current student-athletes at Duncanville. The event also featured a screening of Black's episode of The Origin, offering inspiration to the students, who each received a new pair of Lebron Witness 8 sneakers in team colors.</p><p>Dr. T. Lamar Goree, Duncanville ISD Superintendent, praised the partnership for its focus on community support and investment in student-athletes' futures. The initiative's dual focus on immediate financial support and long-term career opportunities represents a holistic approach to youth development. Robby Bullington, Hibbett Vice President of Stores, shared his enthusiasm for the program's potential to influence high school student-athletes positively, highlighting the career development opportunities awaiting them.</p><p>The First String initiative by Hibbett and Nike is a testament to the power of corporate philanthropy in making a tangible difference in local communities. By supporting athletic programs and offering scholarships and internships, the initiative aims to equip student-athletes with the tools they need for success beyond high school. As the program expands, it promises to create a lasting legacy of empowerment and opportunity for young athletes across the nation.</p></p>
