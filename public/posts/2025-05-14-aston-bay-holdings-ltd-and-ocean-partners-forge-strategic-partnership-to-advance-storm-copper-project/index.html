          <p class='mb-4'><p>Aston Bay Holdings Ltd. has entered into a strategic partnership with Ocean Partners Holdings, a move set to significantly accelerate the development of the Storm Copper Project located in Nunavut, Canada. This collaboration includes substantial project financing and an exclusive offtake agreement, which could markedly transform Aston Bay's exploration and development efforts. The partnership is bolstered by a joint venture with American West Metals, securing up to 80% project development financing for Aston Bay.</p><p>The agreement grants Ocean Partners exclusive rights to copper and silver products from near-surface mineralization at the project site, a deal underpinned by recent financial injections. These include a US$3.5 million second tranche payment from Taurus Mining Royalty and a direct payment of C$0.996 million to Aston Bay. Thomas Ullrich, CEO of Aston Bay, underscored the partnership's importance, pointing to Ocean Partners' proven expertise in ore-sorting and direct shipping ore (DSO) copper project development as a key factor in validating the project's potential and ensuring a low-risk pathway to future development.</p><p>The Storm Project property, encompassing both the Storm Copper Project and the Seal Zinc Deposit, operates under a 20/80 unincorporated joint venture between Aston Bay and American West Metals. This arrangement allows Aston Bay to maintain a carried interest until American West completes a bankable feasibility study, with American West shouldering the responsibility for funding joint venture activities.</p><p>This strategic partnership marks a critical milestone for Aston Bay, setting the stage for aggressive exploration and pre-feasibility efforts in 2025. Ocean Partners' involvement not only brings financial support but also invaluable technical expertise, crucial for advancing the Storm Copper Project's development potential. For industry leaders and stakeholders, this collaboration signals a robust confidence in the project's viability and the broader potential of Nunavut's mineral resources, offering insights into the evolving dynamics of global copper supply chains and the strategic importance of partnerships in unlocking complex mineral projects.</p></p>
