          <p class='mb-4'><p>Lahontan Gold Corp., a Canadian mineral exploration company, has taken a significant step towards enhancing its market presence by selecting Investor Brand Network (IBN) to lead its corporate communications strategy. This partnership is set to play a pivotal role in amplifying the company's visibility as it progresses with its gold and silver projects in Nevada's Walker Lane district. With a focus on unlocking the value of oxide resources from past-producing sites, Lahontan's strategic move underscores the importance of effective communication in the mining industry.</p><p>The company's flagship Santa Fe Mine project, with a history of producing 359,202 ounces of gold and 702,067 ounces of silver between 1988 and 1995, stands as a testament to the potential for near-term production. The project boasts a Canadian National Instrument 43-101 compliant Indicated Mineral Resource of 1,539,000 ounces of gold equivalent and an Inferred Mineral Resource of 411,000 ounces of gold equivalent. Lahontan's plans to advance the Santa Fe Mine project, update its Preliminary Economic Assessment, and conduct drilling tests on its West Santa Fe project in 2025, highlight the company's commitment to capital-efficient development strategies.</p><p>By leveraging IBN's extensive distribution network, which includes over 5,000 outlets and more than 70 brands, Lahontan aims to enhance its engagement with investors, media, and the broader market. This collaboration is not just about increasing visibility; it's about strategically positioning the company to achieve its goals of efficiently and effectively developing its Nevada-based mineral assets. For industry leaders and investors, this partnership serves as a reminder of the critical role that strategic communications play in the success of mining projects and the broader business and technology landscape.</p></p>
