        <p>In a groundbreaking development for the data center industry, <a href="https://shumateengineering.com/">Shumate Engineering</a> has unveiled its innovative Hybrid-Dry/Adiabatic-Cooling (HDAC) design, a solution that promises to drastically reduce power and water consumption in data centers. Presented at <a href="https://afcom.com/">AFCOM’s</a> Data Center World conference, the HDAC system combines wet and dry cooling techniques within a closed loop, offering a sustainable alternative to traditional cooling methods. With the data center industry facing unprecedented demand due to the rise of artificial intelligence and cloud computing, Shumate Engineering's design could not have come at a better time. The system has already proven its efficacy in tests conducted at <a href="https://baltimoreaircoil.com/">Baltimore Aircoil Company's</a> facility, meeting all design requirements and showcasing significant savings in natural resources and operational costs.</p><p>The HDAC design, spearheaded by Daren Shumate and R. Stephen Spinazzola, represents a leap forward in cooling technology, capable of reducing power usage by half and water consumption by 90% compared to conventional systems. This innovation is particularly relevant as the industry grapples with the environmental and financial implications of cooling high-density data centers. With patents pending and a successful demonstration under its belt, Shumate Engineering is poised to revolutionize the way data centers manage their cooling needs, offering a scalable, efficient, and environmentally friendly solution.</p>

          <p class='mb-4'><p>The data center industry is at a crossroads, with the explosive growth of artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, and cloud computing driving unprecedented demand for energy and water resources. Shumate Engineering's Hybrid-Dry/Adiabatic-Cooling (HDAC) system emerges as a game-changer, addressing these challenges head-on. By integrating wet and dry cooling techniques within a closed loop, the HDAC system slashes power consumption by half and water usage by over 90% compared to traditional methods.</p><p>Presented at AFCOM’s Data Center World conference, the HDAC system's potential to redefine industry standards is undeniable. Its successful testing at Baltimore Aircoil Company's facility, where it met all design requirements, including maintaining optimal fluid supply temperatures under various conditions, speaks volumes about its reliability and efficiency. Achieving a power usage effectiveness (PUE) range of 1.1 to 1.06 for hyperscale data centers in the mid-Atlantic region, the HDAC system sets a new benchmark for sustainability and operational cost savings.</p><p>The environmental implications of this innovation are profound. As data centers come under increasing scrutiny for their hefty resource consumption, the HDAC system offers a viable path forward. Its ability to support the sustainable scaling of AI and high-density workloads without compromising on environmental responsibility is particularly timely. With technologies like ChatGPT consuming significantly more power than traditional web searches, the need for efficient cooling solutions has never been more critical.</p><p>Shumate Engineering's HDAC system not only addresses the immediate challenges faced by the data center industry but also lays the groundwork for a more sustainable and energy-efficient future in computing. By significantly reducing both power and water usage, the HDAC system represents a pivotal advancement in the quest to balance technological growth with environmental stewardship.</p></p>
