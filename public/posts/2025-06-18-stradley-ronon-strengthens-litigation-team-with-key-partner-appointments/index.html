        <p>Stradley Ronon, a prominent law firm, has significantly bolstered its litigation and investigations team by welcoming Jordann Conaboy and Benjamin McCoy as partners in its Philadelphia office. Both attorneys, previously partners at Fox Rothschild, bring a wealth of experience in complex litigation, particularly in health care, managed care, and pharmaceutical disputes. Their expertise in handling large-scale cases, including fraud claims and government investigations, aligns with Stradley Ronon's commitment to providing comprehensive legal services in these sectors. Jeff Grossman, co-chair of the firm's litigation practice, highlighted the duo's ability to navigate the intricate regulatory and litigation challenges facing clients today.</p><p>Jordann Conaboy's background as an assistant U.S. attorney in the District of New Jersey, where he prosecuted significant health care fraud cases, and Benjamin McCoy's experience in representing health insurers against fraud operations, underscore their capability to handle high-stakes litigation. Their addition to Stradley Ronon is part of the firm's strategic growth in litigation and related fields, following the recent inclusion of a five-lawyer insurance/reinsurance litigation team in New York and Washington, D.C.
