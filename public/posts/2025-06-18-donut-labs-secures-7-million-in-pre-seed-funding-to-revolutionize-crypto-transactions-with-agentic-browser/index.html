        <p>Donut Labs, a New York-based startup, has successfully closed a $7 million pre-seed funding round led by HongShan Capital Group, with participation from notable investors such as BitKraft, HackVC, and Matrix Partners. The company is developing an innovative 'agentic browser' designed to revolutionize cryptocurrency trading by integrating financial actions directly into the browsing experience. Founded by Chris Zhu, a Stern School of Business alumnus and former ByteDance product strategy manager, Donut Labs boasts a team of experts from Meta AI, Tencent, and other leading tech firms. The browser aims to merge information retrieval with financial transactions, offering users a seamless platform to trade, bet, and earn yield on cryptocurrencies without navigating away from a single page. Utilizing the CodeAct framework and a MCP client, Donut's technology promises to enhance the efficiency and accessibility of crypto transactions. The company also plans to integrate a wallet, network, and decentralized exchange into its interface, further simplifying the crypto experience for users.</p>

          <p class='mb-4'><p>Donut Labs, a New York-based startup, has successfully raised $7 million in a pre-seed funding round, signaling strong investor confidence in its mission to redefine cryptocurrency transactions. The funding round was led by HongShan Capital Group, with participation from BitKraft, HackVC, and Matrix Partners among others. This financial boost is set to accelerate the development of Donut Labs' agentic browser, a groundbreaking tool designed to streamline the way users interact with digital currencies.</p><p>Founded by Chris Zhu, an alumnus of NYU Stern School of Business and former product strategy manager at ByteDance, Donut Labs is assembling a team of experts from leading institutions and companies. The startup's innovative approach focuses on hyper-financializing the internet's front-end for AI agents, integrating decentralized tools into a single interface. This could significantly reduce the complexity of crypto transactions, allowing users to trade, earn yield, and more without leaving a single page.</p><p>The technology behind Donut Labs' solution, the CodeAct framework, leverages executable Python code to empower agents based on large language models. This, combined with a MCP client and a headless browser, is poised to facilitate a wide array of cryptocurrency transactions. Additionally, the company's plans to incorporate a wallet, network, and decentralized exchange within its interface promise a comprehensive ecosystem for crypto enthusiasts.</p><p>The implications of Donut Labs' work are profound, challenging the traditional browser model that has dominated the internet for decades. By offering a more efficient and accessible way to engage with digital currencies, Donut Labs is not just simplifying crypto transactions but also paving the way for a new era of financial interactions online. This development could have far-reaching effects on the crypto industry, making advanced financial tools more accessible to a wider audience and potentially accelerating the adoption of digital currencies.</p></p>
