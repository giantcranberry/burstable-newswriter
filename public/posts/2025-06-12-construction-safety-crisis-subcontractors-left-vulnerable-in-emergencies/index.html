        <p>In a groundbreaking revelation, Cory Sherman, founder of Safety Systems Management, highlights a critical oversight in construction site safety protocols: the exclusion of subcontractors from emergency communications. Despite constituting the majority of the workforce on many sites, subcontractors are often left out of emergency alerts, leading to dangerous communication gaps. With the construction industry facing increasing risks from heat waves, wildfires, and jobsite violence, the need for inclusive emergency notification systems has never been more urgent. Wireless emergency notification systems emerge as a solution, offering real-time alerts to all workers, irrespective of their employment status. Industry leaders are now recognizing the importance of including every worker in safety protocols, marking a significant shift towards more inclusive and effective jobsite safety measures.</p><p>Safety Systems Management, founded by Cory Sherman in 2016, is at the forefront of this change, specializing in wireless emergency notification systems that ensure all workers are alerted during emergencies. These systems, which operate on a patented mobile platform, are designed to improve evacuation times, emergency service notifications, and overall jobsite communications. The company's efforts underscore a moral imperative in the construction industry: protecting every worker equally.

          <p class='mb-4'><p>The construction industry faces a pressing safety challenge as subcontractors are consistently left out of critical emergency communications, putting a significant portion of the workforce at risk. Cory Sherman, a renowned jobsite safety expert, has brought attention to this alarming oversight, which sees subcontractors frequently missing out on essential safety meetings and relying on informal channels for updates. This communication gap not only undermines the effectiveness of safety protocols but also poses a serious threat to worker safety amidst growing environmental and man-made hazards.</p><p>A recent survey reveals that over 60% of subcontractors have either never received site-specific emergency training or were excluded from direct alert systems, a statistic that underscores the severity of the issue. Despite OSHA's mandate for safe working conditions, the enforcement of emergency communication standards remains inconsistent, especially on larger or more complex construction sites. Sherman's advocacy for wireless emergency notification systems presents a viable solution, ensuring that real-time alerts reach every worker through wearable devices, mobile apps, or sitewide audio/visual systems, regardless of their employment status.</p><p>The industry is beginning to take notice, with some national general contractors now requiring that emergency communication systems cover all site personnel. Sherman's argument is compelling: inclusive communication in emergencies is not merely beneficial but essential for saving lives. Subcontractors, as vital members of project teams, deserve the same level of safety protection as full-time employees. As construction safety standards evolve, the adoption of advanced communication technologies and the inclusion of all workers in emergency protocols represent crucial advancements toward a safer, more inclusive work environment.</p><p>This development is not just about regulatory compliance; it's about fostering a culture of safety that values every individual on the jobsite. The implications of this shift are profound, offering the potential to significantly reduce accidents and fatalities in one of the most hazardous industries. For business and technology leaders, this story highlights the critical intersection of safety, technology, and human rights in the workplace, serving as a call to action for industries worldwide to reevaluate and enhance their emergency communication strategies.</p></p>
