          <p class='mb-4'><p>Peoples Financial Corporation, the parent entity of The Peoples Bank, has announced a regular semi-annual cash dividend of $0.18 per common share. This dividend is scheduled for payment on June 13, 2025, to shareholders recorded by June 11, 2025. Chevis C. Swetman, the Chairman and CEO, highlighted this move as a testament to the company's ongoing financial enhancement and its pledge to reward its shareholders. The declaration underscores the firm's solid financial standing and its strategic efforts to enhance investor value.</p><p>Established in 1896, The Peoples Bank boasts a network of 18 banking locations spread across Hancock, Harrison, Jackson, and Stone counties on the Mississippi Gulf Coast. As of March 31, 2025, the bank reported total assets amounting to $867 million. It provides a wide array of retail and commercial banking solutions, alongside trust and investment services that have been aiding clients with financial, estate, and retirement planning since 1936.</p><p>The company's shares are traded on the OTCQX Best Market, identified by the symbol PFBX. Further details about the company are accessible through its official website and the Securities and Exchange Commission's online portal. While the dividend announcement is a positive indicator of the company's financial resilience, Peoples Financial Corporation also cautions about potential risks and uncertainties that could influence future outcomes. These forward-looking statements are contingent on various factors that may lead to deviations from expected results.</p><p>This development is significant for investors and the banking sector as it reflects the company's ability to generate sufficient earnings to support dividend payments, a key indicator of financial health and stability. For the industry, it signals confidence in traditional banking models amidst evolving financial landscapes. For shareholders, it represents a tangible return on investment, reinforcing trust in the company's management and strategic direction. However, the acknowledgment of potential risks serves as a reminder of the volatile nature of the financial sector, urging stakeholders to remain vigilant.</p></p>
