          <p class='mb-4'><p>The release of "Inclusionism: Finally! A Blueprint for the Bold Transformation of Capitalism" marks a pivotal moment in the discourse on economic systems. Co-authored by visionary designer MAXBRUCE alongside advanced artificial intelligences ChatGPT and Claude, the book presents a radical framework aimed at overhauling traditional capitalist models through the introduction of Consumer Earned Tokenized Equities (CETEs). These programmable assets are designed to democratize wealth distribution by rewarding participation over speculation, offering a tangible solution to economic inequality.</p><p>At the heart of the book's proposal is the empowerment of everyday individuals, with a strong emphasis on the necessity of digital and financial literacy. MAXBRUCE argues that such knowledge is crucial for enabling people to alter economic dynamics fundamentally. The book specifically addresses young people, providing them with the tools and understanding needed to navigate and potentially reshape the economic systems they will inherit. This focus underscores the importance of preparing the next generation for active participation in economic transformation.</p><p>Backed by the Better World Regulatory Coalition Inc. (BWRCI), the framework outlined in "Inclusionism" includes detailed regulatory governance and jurisdictional coordination mechanisms. It critiques the current lack of sovereign wealth funds with global stakeholder ambitions, particularly pointing out the United States' absence in this area. The book's comprehensive approach offers not just criticism but a practical, forward-looking model for achieving economic inclusivity, targeting activists, citizens, and visionaries who seek alternatives to traditional redistribution methods.</p><p>With special editions available in the UAE, Kenya, and Saudi Arabia, "Inclusionism: Finally!" is positioned as a global resource for understanding and potentially implementing future economic structures. Its publication represents a significant contribution to ongoing debates about economic design, the role of technology in facilitating equitable value flows, and the moral imperatives of economic frameworks. As sovereign wealth funds and institutional leaders increasingly explore inclusive strategies, this book provides a timely and insightful exploration of how economic systems might evolve to better serve all participants.</p></p>
