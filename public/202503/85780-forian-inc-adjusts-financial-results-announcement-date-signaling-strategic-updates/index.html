          <p class='mb-4'><p>Forian Inc., a leader in data science-driven information and analytics solutions, has announced a change in the date for releasing its fourth quarter and full year 2024 financial results. Originally set for an earlier date, the new announcement is scheduled for Monday, March 31, 2025, after the market closes. This adjustment may hint at underlying strategic considerations or updates the company is preparing to share with its stakeholders.</p><p>The company plans to host a conference call and webcast at 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time on the same day, offering investors and analysts a deep dive into its financial performance and strategic direction. Forian's commitment to transparency is further evidenced by the availability of a call replay on its investor website, ensuring stakeholders have ample opportunity to review the details at their convenience.</p><p>Forian's recent acquisition of Kyber Data Science has significantly enhanced its data management and analytics capabilities, positioning the company as a formidable player in the life sciences, healthcare, and financial services sectors. This move underscores Forian's dedication to leveraging advanced data science to drive innovation and efficiency across these industries.</p><p>The forthcoming financial results and the insights shared during the conference call will be closely watched by investors and industry observers alike. The inclusion of forward-looking statements in the announcement, while standard, serves as a reminder of the inherent uncertainties and risks that could influence the company's future performance. These developments are of particular importance to business and technology leaders seeking to understand the evolving landscape of data science and its impact on various sectors.</p></p>
