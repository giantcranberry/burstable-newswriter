          <p class='mb-4'><p>In an era where artificial intelligence (AI) is reshaping industries, NetCom Learning has stepped forward with a solution to bridge the skills gap. The company has announced the launch of AI CERTs™ training packages, a series of strategic AI training bundles designed to equip organizations with the necessary tools to develop comprehensive AI capabilities. These bundles not only aim to enhance the AI proficiency of teams across different sectors but also offer significant cost savings, with discounts of up to 30% compared to individual course pricing.</p><p>The training packages are meticulously categorized into four primary domains to cater to diverse organizational needs: AI for IT Teams, AI for Business Teams, AI for Leaders and Decision Makers, and AI for Innovation and Automation. Each bundle is packed with specialized certification courses tailored to address specific professional requirements, ensuring that participants gain relevant and actionable knowledge.</p><p>For IT professionals, the AI for IT Teams bundle, priced at $17,978, includes six comprehensive courses such as AI+ Developer™ and Cloud™ certifications. Business teams are not left behind, with a five-course package focused on AI applications in key areas like marketing and customer service available for $3,732. Leaders and decision-makers can leverage a five-course executive bundle, while those interested in pushing the boundaries of AI can explore the Innovation and Automation package, which includes courses on AI+ Robotics™ and Quantum applications.</p><p>NetCom Learning's approach to AI education emphasizes practical implementation, ensuring that learners can apply theoretical knowledge to real-world scenarios. The inclusion of a Guaranteed to Run (GTR) assurance further enhances the value of these bundles, offering monthly scheduled classes to fit into flexible enterprise training strategies.</p><p>This initiative by NetCom Learning is a timely response to the escalating demand for structured and accessible AI education. As AI continues to drive innovation and efficiency across sectors, the ability for organizations to upskill their workforce in this domain has never been more critical. These training bundles represent a significant step forward in making AI education more attainable for businesses, thereby fostering a more AI-literate workforce capable of navigating the complexities of the modern technological landscape.</p></p>
