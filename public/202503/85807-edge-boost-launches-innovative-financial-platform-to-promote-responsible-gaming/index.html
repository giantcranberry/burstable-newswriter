          <p class='mb-4'><p>The gaming industry is witnessing a transformative approach to responsible betting with the launch of EDGE Boost, a financial technology platform that provides users with a dedicated debit card and bank account specifically for gaming transactions. This innovative solution, which has already processed $300 million in transactions during its stealth phase, aims to separate gaming expenditures from everyday finances, offering a new level of financial management and transparency for bettors.</p><p>Backed by $17.2 million in seed funding led by Bullpen Capital and supplemented by $32 million in debt financing, EDGE Boost is setting a new standard in the gaming financial sector. The platform's unique features include personalized spending limit suggestions based on individual cash flow, cashback incentives for gaming merchants, and the ability to instantly deploy funds across multiple gaming platforms. Moreover, the EDGE Boost debit card requires no minimum balance or maintenance costs, making it an accessible option for all users.</p><p>What sets EDGE Boost apart is its commitment to financial security and responsible gaming. The platform's FDIC-insured account offers protection up to $250,000, a first for betting-only bank accounts. This level of security, combined with the platform's comprehensive financial tools, addresses a significant gap in the gaming market by providing users with a holistic view of their betting finances.</p><p>Seni Thomas, Founder and CEO of EDGE Boost, highlights the platform's potential to revolutionize the way bettors manage their gaming expenditures. As the legal U.S. gaming market continues to grow, EDGE Boost's emphasis on transparency and control represents a critical step forward in promoting safer betting practices. By empowering users with advanced financial insights and tools, the platform not only enhances the betting experience but also mitigates the risks associated with gaming expenditures, marking a pivotal moment in the intersection of finance and gaming technology.</p></p>
