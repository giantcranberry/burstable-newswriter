          <p class='mb-4'><p>HIVE Digital Technologies is making strategic moves to bolster its position in the Bitcoin mining industry with significant acquisitions in Paraguay. The company's recent activities include mining nearly 90 Bitcoins in February, elevating its total Bitcoin holdings to 2,620 BTC, valued at approximately $220 million. This growth is part of HIVE's broader strategy to expand its computational power from 6 EH/s to 25 EH/s by September 2025, a move that underscores its ambition to dominate the Bitcoin mining sector.</p><p>The acquisition of 300 MW of Bitcoin mining capacity in Paraguay, including 200 MW from Bitfarms, is a cornerstone of HIVE's expansion strategy. Luke Rossy, HIVE's Chief Operating Officer, highlighted the progress at the Yguazú facility, emphasizing the importance of hydro-powered mining assets in achieving efficiency and sustainability. This approach not only positions HIVE as a leader in the cryptocurrency mining industry but also aligns with global trends towards more sustainable and environmentally friendly mining practices.</p><p>Analysts have taken note of HIVE's strategic initiatives, with Rosenblatt initiating coverage of HIVE stock with a 'buy' rating and a $6 price target. The company's innovative use of hydro-powered data centers and its early mover advantage in Bitcoin mining are seen as key drivers of its potential for unprecedented growth. HIVE's expansion into Paraguay and its focus on high-performance computing and blockchain technology signal its readiness to meet the surging demand for data center computing, setting the stage for significant market expansion in 2025 and beyond.</p><p>To support its ambitious growth plans, HIVE has strengthened its leadership team by appointing Craig Tavares as President and Chief Operating Officer of its BUZZ HPC business segment. Tavares's mandate includes driving the segment's revenue toward the $100 million threshold, further solidifying HIVE's position in the competitive technological landscape. As the company continues to navigate the complex cryptocurrency market cycles, its strategic investments and leadership enhancements are expected to propel HIVE Digital Technologies into a new era of growth and innovation.</p></p>
