          <p class='mb-4'><p>Aquafil Group (ECNL.MI) has reported a strong performance in the fourth quarter of 2024, showcasing its ability to navigate a complex market environment through strategic adaptations and operational efficiencies. The company's financial results revealed revenues of €128.4 million, with a notable 36.0% year-over-year increase in adjusted EBITDA. A key highlight was the expansion of its ECONYL® regenerated nylon product line, which accounted for 57.2% of fiber revenues, marking a 50-basis-point increase from the previous quarter.</p><p>Geographically, Aquafil faced mixed conditions, with North American markets experiencing volume declines, while the EMEA and Asia Pacific regions showed growth and met budget expectations. Despite these challenges, the company is optimistic about a recovery in North America, citing early signs of increasing orders for fiscal year 2025. This geographical diversification underscores Aquafil's resilience and adaptability in fluctuating markets.</p><p>Financially, Aquafil has made significant strides in improving its debt management and operational efficiency, as evidenced by the reduction in its net financial position-to-EBITDA ratio from 5.11x at the end of fiscal year 2023 to 3.42x by the end of the fourth quarter of 2024. This improvement reflects the company's focused approach to strengthening its financial health.</p><p>Analysts from Stonegate Capital Partners have provided a valuation range for Aquafil from €3.97 to €5.02 per share, with a midpoint of €4.51, indicating a positive market perception of the company's growth potential. Looking ahead, Aquafil aims to further expand its ECONYL® line, targeting a 60% revenue contribution by the end of fiscal year 2025. With cost-cutting measures in place and the benefit of a covenant holiday from lenders, the company is well-positioned for future growth and improved financial performance.</p><p>The significance of Aquafil's performance lies not only in its financial achievements but also in its commitment to sustainability through the ECONYL® product line. This focus on sustainable innovation is increasingly important to consumers and industries alike, positioning Aquafil as a leader in the transition towards more environmentally friendly manufacturing practices. The company's strategic adaptations and financial improvements serve as a testament to its resilience and forward-thinking approach in a challenging market environment.</p></p>
