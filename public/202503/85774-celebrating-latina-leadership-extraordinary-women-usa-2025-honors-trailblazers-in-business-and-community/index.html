          <p class='mb-4'><p>The Extraordinary Women USA 2025 event, held at Il Forno restaurant in Doral, Florida, served as a vibrant celebration of twenty Latina leaders and entrepreneurs who have made indelible marks in their fields. This prestigious gathering not only honored their achievements but also underscored the vital role women play in driving business innovation and community development. Mayor Christi Fraga's opening remarks highlighted the essence of leadership and resilience, alongside the financial support programs available to women-led businesses in Doral, reflecting the city's dedication to fostering female entrepreneurship.</p><p>Hosted by journalist Nancy Clara, the ceremony recognized a distinguished group of women, including Evelyn Reynoso, Kristen Umanzor, and Xiomara Navarro, among others. These honorees have excelled in various sectors, demonstrating the diverse talents and contributions of Latina professionals. The event's success was bolstered by the support of sponsors such as Armani Cosmetics & Dillards, Archangel Brokers, and the Mayte Prida Foundation, all of whom share a commitment to advancing women's professional achievements.</p><p>Since its inception in 2016 by Hispanic Target Magazine, the Extraordinary Women USA initiative has evolved from a local Miami recognition program to an international platform. It celebrates women who are agents of change across business, health, fashion, culture, and philanthropy. By providing visibility and recognition, the event not only honors individual accomplishments but also inspires future generations of women leaders. The carefully selected honorees represent a wide range of professional backgrounds and have made significant contributions to their communities, illustrating the profound impact of Latina leadership in shaping a more inclusive and dynamic business landscape.</p></p>
