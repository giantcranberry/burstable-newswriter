          <p class='mb-4'><p>The 10th annual 'Best & Brightest Business Majors' list, recently unveiled by Poets&Quants for Undergrads, spotlights 100 seniors from the nation's leading undergraduate business programs who stand out for their entrepreneurial leadership, academic achievements, and dedication to community service. This year's cohort, described by senior writer Jeff Schmitt as notably proactive, demonstrates a remarkable ability to identify needs and take decisive action, setting a new benchmark for future business leaders.</p><p>Representing a wide array of business disciplines such as business administration, marketing, finance, and operations, the list includes individuals like David Elias Kurzmann from ESCP Business School, founder of vipi.education, a tutoring service that spans across Europe. Stephen Mitchell from Marquette University, recognized as the Men's Basketball Scholar-Athlete of the Year, and Skyler Mott from Lehigh University, who manages a realty business with properties worth $5 million, are among the notable honorees. Kassidy Allen from Texas Christian University's Neeley School also stands out for her over 200 hours of service as a consultative selling coach and her receipt of the Junior of the Year award.</p><p>Compiled through nominations from the top 50 undergraduate business schools, the list achieves a balanced representation with 51 men and 49 women. Each profile offers a deep dive into the students' extracurricular engagements, accomplishments, and personal insights, enriched by endorsements from faculty and administrators. This feature not only celebrates the individual achievements of these students but also highlights the evolving landscape of business education, where academic rigor is increasingly paired with innovative thinking and a commitment to societal contribution.</p><p>For leaders in business and technology, the 'Best & Brightest' list serves as a valuable resource for identifying emerging talent and understanding the qualities that define the next generation of business innovators. The achievements of these students underscore the importance of fostering a culture of leadership, creativity, and social responsibility within academic institutions, ensuring that the future of business is in capable hands.</p></p>
