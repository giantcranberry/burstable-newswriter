          <p class='mb-4'><p>The Lisk Blockchain Incubation Hub, in collaboration with CV Labs, has marked a significant milestone in its mission to nurture African Web3 startups. The completion of its inaugural six-month program has not only demonstrated the hub's potential but also highlighted the vibrant innovation within Africa's blockchain ecosystem. With 23 startups receiving comprehensive support, the program has been instrumental in refining business strategies and facilitating access to crucial financial resources.</p><p>During its first cohort, the program distributed $196,000 in grants, enabling participating startups to achieve remarkable milestones. These include onboarding over 26,000 users, tokenizing $1.8 million in assets, and processing more than 20,000 blockchain transactions. Such achievements underscore the tangible impact of the hub's support on the startups' growth and their ability to innovate within the blockchain space.</p><p>Among the notable graduates are Tata-iMali from South Africa, which has developed a fiat-backed stablecoin to bridge the gap between informal and formal economies, and Nomachain from Kenya, which is transforming homeownership through blockchain-powered rent-to-own models. Additionally, projects like TrendX in Nigeria and Jamit are leveraging blockchain technology to pioneer solutions in tokenization and content monetization, further illustrating the diverse applications of blockchain across different sectors.</p><p>The program's second cohort, scheduled to commence on May 19, 2025, promises to build on this success by offering up to $20,000 per project in grants, alongside mentorship and networking opportunities. Startups will also have the chance to secure an additional $100,000 in funding to scale their ventures, highlighting the hub's commitment to fostering long-term growth and innovation in the African blockchain ecosystem.</p><p>Brenton Naicker from CV VC and Dominic Schwenter, Lisk's COO, have both emphasized the transformative potential of blockchain technology in Africa. Their insights reflect a shared vision of leveraging blockchain to address financial exclusion and create new economic opportunities, particularly in markets that have historically faced challenges in accessing capital and support. Through initiatives like the Lisk Blockchain Incubation Hub, African Web3 startups are not only gaining the resources they need to thrive but are also positioning themselves as key players in the global blockchain innovation landscape.</p></p>
