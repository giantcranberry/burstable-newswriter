        <p>Peoples Financial Corporation, parent of The Peoples Bank, reported a decrease in net income for the first quarter of 2025 compared to the same period in 2024. The decrease was primarily due to lower net interest income and total interest income, partially offset by decreased interest expenses. The Company also saw an increase in its efficiency ratio.</p><p>The Bank's leadership emphasized the commitment to maintaining high-quality assets amidst changing economic conditions. Shareholders' equity improved mainly due to quarterly earnings and a decrease in unrealized losses on securities. The Company's leverage ratio remained strong at 13.32% as of March 31, 2025.</p><p>Founded in 1896, The Peoples Bank operates 18 facilities along the Mississippi Gulf Coast, offering a range of banking and financial services. The Company maintains a well-capitalized balance sheet with strong capital and liquidity, evaluating its financial health continuously.</p>

          <p class='mb-4'><p>Peoples Financial Corporation has reported a notable decrease in its first quarter earnings for 2025, with net income falling to $1,310,000 from $2,415,000 in the same period last year. This decline, amounting to a $1,105,000 reduction, underscores the challenges faced by financial institutions in the current economic climate. The earnings per weighted average common share also saw a decrease from $0.52 to $0.28, reflecting the broader pressures on the banking sector.</p><p>The primary driver behind the reduced earnings was a $1,025,000 decrease in net interest income, with total interest income dropping by $1,370,000 to $7,559,000. This downturn was largely attributed to lower interest income on securities, a consequence of decreased balances and yields. However, the bank demonstrated operational resilience by reducing total interest expenses by $345,000, achieved through lower interest rates on deposit accounts and reduced borrowing costs.</p><p>Financial performance metrics further illustrated the impact of the economic environment, with the return on average assets decreasing from 1.12% to 0.62% and the efficiency ratio increasing from 64% to 77% for the first quarter of 2025. Despite these challenges, Peoples Financial Corporation showed strength in its shareholders' equity, which increased by $4,454,000 to $94,455,000 at the end of March 2025. This improvement was supported by quarterly earnings and a significant decrease in unrealized losses on securities.</p><p>The bank's strategic focus on maintaining high-quality assets and its vigilance towards economic conditions and potential interest rate changes were emphasized by Chevis C. Swetman, chairman and chief executive officer. With 18 bank facilities across the Mississippi Gulf Coast and total assets of $867 million as of March 31, 2025, Peoples Financial Corporation remains a key player in the regional banking sector, navigating through the complexities of the current financial landscape.</p></p>
