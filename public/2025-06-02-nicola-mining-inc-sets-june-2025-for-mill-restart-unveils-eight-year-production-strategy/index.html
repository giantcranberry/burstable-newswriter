          <p class='mb-4'><p>Nicola Mining Inc. is gearing up for a significant operational milestone with the planned restart of its fully permitted mill in June 2025. This move is part of a broader eight-year production strategy aimed at harnessing the company's diverse mineral processing capabilities. CEO Peter Espig recently underscored the strategic importance of this initiative during a pre-Commodities Global Expo podcast, pointing to the company's six active permits that cover gold, silver, copper, quarrying, and milling operations as a cornerstone of its competitive edge.</p><p>The company's unique designation as Canada's only designated mining industrial site affords it province-wide processing rights for gold and silver, a privilege that enhances operational flexibility and positions Nicola Mining favorably within the competitive mining sector. At the heart of Nicola Mining's production strategy is its 100% owned mill and tailings facility near Merritt, British Columbia. This facility is equipped to process both gold and silver mill feed through gravity and flotation processes, showcasing the company's versatile approach to mineral extraction.</p><p>Nicola Mining's ambitious plans are further supported by its robust project portfolio, which includes the New Craigmont Project. This high-grade copper property spans 10,913 hectares along the southern end of the Guichon Batholith, adjacent to Highland Valley Copper, Canada's largest copper mine. Such strategic positioning opens up considerable development opportunities for the company. Additionally, the Treasure Mountain Property, comprising 30 mineral claims and a mineral lease over more than 2,200 hectares, adds to Nicola Mining's diverse asset base, enabling multiple revenue streams and mineral extraction opportunities.</p><p>The impending mill restart marks a pivotal moment for Nicola Mining, reflecting a well-considered strategy towards resource development and processing. With its array of permits and a diversified project portfolio, the company is laying the groundwork for sustained production and potential expansion in the mining sector. This development not only signifies Nicola Mining's growth trajectory but also highlights the broader implications for the mining industry, particularly in terms of operational efficiency and the exploitation of Canada's mineral resources.</p></p>
