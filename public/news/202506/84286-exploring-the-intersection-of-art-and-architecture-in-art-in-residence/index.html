          <p class='mb-4'><p>Nicole England's latest publication, 'Art in Residence', offers an unprecedented look into homes that transcend traditional living spaces to become canvases for artistic and personal expression. Featuring the work of Pol Theis, founder of P&T Interiors LLC, the book presents 22 homes from around the globe, each narrating a unique story through the art it houses and the design that envelops it. From an industrial artist's studio in New York to a tranquil coastal retreat in Victoria, Australia, England's photography captures the essence of these spaces, revealing the intimate bond between art, architecture, and their inhabitants.</p><p>The inclusion of Pol Theis in 'Art in Residence' highlights his esteemed reputation for crafting spaces that are not only visually stunning but also deeply reflective of the homeowner's personality and lifestyle. His design philosophy, which prioritizes the individual's identity and artistic passions, resonates with the book's overarching theme of homes as mirrors of personal and artistic expression. Through interviews with homeowners, readers gain insight into the significance of their art collections and the thoughtful design decisions that make their homes truly their own.</p><p>'Art in Residence' transcends the conventional interior design book by illustrating how art and architecture collaborate to create environments that inspire, comfort, and reflect the rich diversity of human experience. For those passionate about design and art, the book provides a unique lens through which to view the transformative power of creativity in shaping the spaces we inhabit. It's a compelling exploration of how our surroundings can influence our lives, offering inspiration for anyone looking to infuse their living spaces with personal meaning and artistic flair.</p></p>
