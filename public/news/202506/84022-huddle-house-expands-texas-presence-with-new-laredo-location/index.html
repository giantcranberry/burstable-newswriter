          <p class='mb-4'><p>Huddle House, a name synonymous with home-style American cuisine and all-day breakfast, has officially launched its first location in Laredo, Texas. Situated at 5300 San Dario Ave, Suite C2 within the Mall del Norte, this new outlet not only marks the brand's 21st establishment in Texas but also signifies its ambitious plan to expand its presence across the state. The 3,000 square feet restaurant is designed to serve the community with hearty meals from breakfast through dinner, operating daily from 6 am to 9 pm, and offering dine-in, takeout, and online ordering options.</p><p>The expansion into Laredo is part of Huddle House's broader strategy to double its footprint in Texas, following a recent 20-unit agreement for the Houston-metropolitan area. Peter Ortiz, Chief Development Officer for Ascent Hospitality Management, the parent company of Huddle House, highlighted the brand's enthusiasm for bringing its signature hospitality and quality meals to new communities. This move underscores the company's commitment to growth and community engagement, leveraging its franchise model known for flexible build options and comprehensive support to attract multi-unit owners.</p><p>With nearly 300 locations nationwide, Huddle House has consistently been recognized for its franchise opportunities and culinary offerings. The brand's focus on creating a welcoming atmosphere where guests can enjoy delicious, affordable meals has cemented its position in the competitive restaurant industry. The opening of the Laredo location is a clear indicator of Huddle House's dedication to expanding its reach and reinforcing its reputation as a beloved dining spot across the United States.</p></p>
