          <p class='mb-4'><p>Cabot Corporation, a leader in the specialty chemicals and performance materials sector, has announced a pivotal leadership change within its Reinforcement Materials Segment. Hobart C. Kalkstein, the executive vice president and president of the segment, will retire on January 5, 2026, marking the end of a distinguished career that significantly contributed to the company's financial and operational success. Effective June 15, 2025, Matthew Wood, currently the vice president of global marketing and strategy for the Battery Materials product line, will take over as senior vice president and president of the segment.</p><p>Kalkstein's leadership has been instrumental in Cabot's achievements, particularly in reinforcing its status as a leading supplier to the tire industry and in the development of the EVOLVE® Sustainable Solutions technology platform. His departure represents a significant transition for the company, but Cabot is poised for continued success under Wood's leadership. Wood's extensive experience, including his tenure at BP, plc before joining Cabot in 2010, and his roles in global marketing and strategy, positions him as a capable successor to drive the segment's growth and innovation.</p><p>This leadership transition is a critical development for the specialty chemicals and performance materials industry, reflecting Cabot's strategic focus on sustaining its market leadership and fostering innovation. Wood's appointment is indicative of the company's commitment to leveraging global experience and strategic insight to navigate the competitive landscape. For stakeholders and industry observers, this move underscores the importance of leadership in driving corporate success and the potential impacts on Cabot's future direction and the broader industry.</p></p>
