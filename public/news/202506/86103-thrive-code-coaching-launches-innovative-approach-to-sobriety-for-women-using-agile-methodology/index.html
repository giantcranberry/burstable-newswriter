          <p class='mb-4'><p>Thrive Code Coaching has officially launched, offering a novel approach to women seeking to quit drinking and reclaim their lives. Founded by Certified Life Coach and Agile Project Manager Erin Lundstrom, the practice utilizes the Drink Free Journey™, a coaching framework that adapts Agile planning methods for personal development. This method breaks down the daunting process of quitting alcohol into manageable steps, fostering long-term change without the stigma often associated with traditional recovery paths.</p><p>Erin Lundstrom, drawing from her own experiences, emphasizes the importance of starting with small, achievable goals. Thrive Code Coaching caters to women at various stages of their journey, whether they're sober-curious, exploring recovery, or ready to stop drinking for good. The core offerings include personalized 1:1 coaching sessions, group coaching programs, and digital tools and resources, all designed to provide women with the support and tools they need to navigate the challenges of quitting alcohol.</p><p>What sets Thrive Code Coaching apart is its application of Agile methodology to personal growth. Originally a project management technique in the software industry, Agile focuses on progress through short, achievable sprints, regular reflection, and continuous improvement. Lundstrom's innovative application of these principles to habit change and sobriety offers a refreshing alternative to traditional recovery methods, emphasizing empowerment over shame.</p><p>For women navigating the complexities of motherhood, midlife, or major life transitions, Thrive Code Coaching provides a compassionate, judgment-free space to explore sobriety and personal growth. With its unique blend of behavioral science, habit-change psychology, and Agile techniques, Thrive Code Coaching is redefining the path to a drink-free life.</p></p>
