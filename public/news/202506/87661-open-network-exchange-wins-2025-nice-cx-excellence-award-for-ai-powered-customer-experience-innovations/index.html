ONE's strategy of scrutinizing actual customer speech patterns and leveraging predictive AI has cultivated a self-service atmosphere that mirrors human interaction more closely.</p><p>Lani Kane-Hanan, CEO at ONE, shared her pride in this recognition, underlining the company's commitment to innovation and the provision of superior, technology-enhanced customer service. Looking ahead, ONE is exploring next-generation AI technologies to provide predictive, tailored service experiences that address customer demands instantaneously.</p></p>
