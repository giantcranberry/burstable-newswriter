          <p class='mb-4'><p>Handel's Ice Cream, a revered name in the ice cream industry, is celebrating a significant milestone with the launch of a limited-time Frosted Animal Cookie flavor. This innovative offering, available from June 3 at select locations, is not just a new flavor but a celebration of the brand's 80-year legacy of quality, innovation, and community engagement. The Frosted Animal Cookie flavor features a cake-flavored ice cream base, swirled with vanilla frosting and dotted with frosted animal cookies, designed to transport consumers back to the joys of childhood.</p><p>Hillary Frei, Chief Marketing Officer of Handel's Ice Cream, shared that the inspiration behind this unique flavor came from franchisee Joseph Ogden, who drew upon his cherished memories of zoo visits and his grandmother's cookies. This personal touch underscores Handel's commitment to leveraging the creativity and insights of its franchisees to enrich its product offerings. Over the years, franchisee-submitted flavors like Sticky Fingers and Raspberry Dream Cream have become fan favorites, showcasing the brand's collaborative approach to flavor innovation.</p><p>The launch of the Frosted Animal Cookie flavor is a strategic move that not only commemorates Handel's 80th anniversary but also reinforces its position as a leader in the competitive ice cream market. Recognized by prestigious awards and rankings, Handel's continues to expand its footprint with over 150 locations across 15 states. This limited-time offering is a testament to the brand's ability to connect with consumers across generations, creating memorable experiences through the universal appeal of ice cream.</p><p>For business and technology leaders, Handel's approach offers valuable insights into the power of nostalgia and innovation in driving brand loyalty and expansion. The Frosted Animal Cookie flavor exemplifies how traditional brands can stay relevant and appealing in a rapidly changing market by blending cherished memories with new experiences. As Handel's continues to grow, its latest flavor serves as a reminder of the brand's enduring appeal and its commitment to delighting customers with every scoop.</p></p>
