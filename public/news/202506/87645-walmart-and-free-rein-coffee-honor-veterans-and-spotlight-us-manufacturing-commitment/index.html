          <p class='mb-4'><p>Walmart, in collaboration with Free Rein Coffee, co-founded by actor and veteran advocate Cole Hauser, recently hosted a coffee giveaway event on Capitol Hill. This event was designed to honor veterans and underscore Walmart's commitment to American-made goods. As part of Walmart's annual U.S. Manufacturing Fly-In, Hauser personally served coffee to veterans, drawing attention to the critical role of supporting U.S. manufacturing and the veteran community.</p><p>Melody Richard, Senior Vice President of Merchandising at Walmart, highlighted the company's dedication to investing in U.S. manufacturing. Richard pointed out that more than two-thirds of Walmart's products are sourced domestically, with 60% of these suppliers being small businesses, such as Free Rein Coffee. This initiative not only supports the American economy but also fosters growth and sustainability among small businesses.</p><p>The event also provided a platform for veterans' organizations to recognize the value of corporate partnerships in advancing their causes. Representatives from the Special Operations Warrior Foundation and With Honor, Sean Corrigan and Rye Barcott respectively, commended Walmart and Free Rein Coffee for their efforts in supporting veterans and promoting bipartisan collaboration among veteran leaders. Walmart's commitment extends beyond this event, with initiatives like the Open Call event for U.S. entrepreneurs, further demonstrating its dedication to American manufacturing and the growth of small businesses.</p><p>This collaboration between Walmart and Free Rein Coffee serves as a model for how corporations can play a pivotal role in supporting veterans and the U.S. economy. By prioritizing American-made products and small businesses, Walmart is not only contributing to the nation's economic health but also honoring those who have served. The implications of such partnerships are far-reaching, offering a blueprint for other corporations to follow in supporting veterans and domestic manufacturing.</p></p>
