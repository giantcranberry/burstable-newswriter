          <p class='mb-4'><p>The recent investment by Pine Street Capital Partners and Parkway Capital in Precision Piping Products (P3), a Houston-based manufacturer specializing in flange protectors, marks a significant endorsement of the company's innovative approach to piping protection. This move not only highlights the investors' confidence in P3's proprietary adhesive solution but also reflects a broader trend of investment in companies that combine innovation with strong market positions.</p><p>Precision Piping Products has distinguished itself in the piping industry through its patented adhesive process, which enhances the durability and reliability of piping systems. This technology is particularly valuable in markets where corrosion and debris present significant challenges, offering P3 a competitive edge. The involvement of Parkway Capital, with its history of mezzanine debt and minority equity investments in lower-middle market companies, alongside Pine Street Capital Partners, underscores the potential they see in P3's growth and its contribution to the industrial services sector.</p><p>This investment is indicative of a larger shift in the investment community's focus towards companies that offer innovative solutions and demonstrate solid financial performance. Parkway Capital's diverse portfolio, which includes manufacturing, distribution, and healthcare, exemplifies this trend. With over $500 million invested since its inception, Parkway Capital's stake in P3 is a clear vote of confidence in the company's future.</p><p>Moreover, the recapitalization of P3, led by Tico Capital Partners and 7 Seas Capital, sheds light on the strategic investments by firms like Calvert Street Investment Partners, Parkway Capital's parent company, which has invested over $1.1 billion in middle-market companies. These investments are crucial for fostering growth and innovation in foundational economic sectors such as manufacturing and industrial services. The recapitalization of P3 is not only a milestone for the company and its investors but also promises advancements in piping protection solutions, benefiting the industries it serves.</p></p>
