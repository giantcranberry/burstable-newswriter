          <p class='mb-4'><p>ABVC BioPharma, Inc., a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company, has made a strategic decision to reward its shareholders through a share dividend, a first in the company's history. This dividend involves the distribution of one share of AiBtl BioPharma Inc. for every share of ABVC common stock owned, potentially distributing around 15 million AiBtl shares. This move is contingent upon the inclusion of these shares in an effective registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, reflecting ABVC's confidence in AiBtl's long-term prospects and its dedication to enhancing shareholder value.</p><p>AiBtl BioPharma, a Delaware-based subsidiary in which ABVC holds a 57.8% majority stake, specializes in developing botanical-based therapeutic candidates for central nervous system disorders, such as major depressive disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. This dividend not only highlights the strategic importance of AiBtl within ABVC's portfolio but also signifies a pivotal moment in ABVC's journey towards growth and international business development for its CNS programs.</p><p>Dr. Uttam Patil, ABVC's Chief Executive Officer, has expressed pride in this milestone, emphasizing the company's progress and its ability to offer such a dividend. The partnership with AiBtl is expected to strengthen ABVC's strategic objectives, including fostering collaborations with global pharmaceutical companies and advancing its pipeline of six drugs and one medical device under development. These initiatives are supported by technology licensed from prestigious research institutions, showcasing ABVC's commitment to innovation in the biopharmaceutical sector.</p><p>While this dividend represents a positive step forward, ABVC BioPharma acknowledges the challenges inherent in the biopharmaceutical industry, including manufacturing, financing, competition, and regulatory approvals. Despite these uncertainties, the dividend distribution is a testament to ABVC's growth trajectory and its efforts to navigate the complexities of the industry while delivering tangible value to its shareholders. This development not only benefits ABVC's investors but also has broader implications for the biopharmaceutical industry, highlighting the potential of botanical-based therapeutics in addressing CNS disorders.</p></p>
