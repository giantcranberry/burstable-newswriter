          <p class='mb-4'><p>U.S. Global Mail has taken a significant step forward in its mission to provide secure and compliant mail management solutions by opening a new, fully-owned and operated facility in Delaware. This expansion is a direct response to the increasing demand from enterprise and B2B clients for reliable and secure mail handling services. The Delaware facility is strategically positioned to serve as a high-throughput mail intake and scanning center, offering an added layer of data protection for sensitive communications.</p><p>The choice of Delaware for the new facility is no coincidence. The state's business-friendly environment and privacy-focused legal framework make it an ideal location for U.S. Global Mail's operations. According to Tashi Nibber, CEO of U.S. Global Mail, these attributes are crucial for serving sectors like legal, healthcare, financial services, and distributed enterprise teams that require seamless, compliant solutions for managing business mail remotely.</p><p>This move is part of U.S. Global Mail's broader strategy to transition from a virtual mailbox provider to a national mail infrastructure partner. With over 30 locations across the country, including several fully owned and operated centers, the company is reinforcing its commitment to supporting modern, distributed businesses in managing their physical mail digitally. The Delaware facility exemplifies U.S. Global Mail's vision of digitizing the last mile of human communication, ensuring that every interaction, transaction, and delivery is instantly manageable and globally accessible.</p><p>The advantages of the Delaware facility are manifold. Being fully owned and operated by the parent company ensures a high level of security and compliance, tailored specifically for high-security B2B and enterprise use cases. Powered by U.S. Global Mail's secure, cloud-based virtual mailbox platform, the facility offers businesses unprecedented control over their physical mail, marking a significant milestone in the company's growth and its contribution to the evolution of mail management services.</p></p>
