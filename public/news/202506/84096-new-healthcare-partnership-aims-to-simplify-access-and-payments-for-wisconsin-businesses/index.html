          <p class='mb-4'><p>The healthcare landscape in Wisconsin is set for a transformative change with the announcement of a strategic partnership between Health Payment Systems (HPS), PayMedix, and Gravie. This alliance is designed to revolutionize healthcare access and payment processes for small and midsize businesses across the state, offering a more affordable and accessible healthcare solution.</p><p>At the heart of this partnership is the utilization of HPS's extensive provider network, which boasts over 100 hospitals, 30,000 physicians, 1,200 clinics, and 630 behavioral health providers. Eligible Gravie members will gain access to this vast network, coupled with the innovative PayMedix platform. This platform consolidates all medical billing into a single, easy-to-understand monthly statement, known as the SuperEOB®, simplifying the often complex and fragmented billing process.</p><p>Moreover, the PayMedix platform introduces interest-free financing and flexible repayment plans for all in-network expenses, effectively removing financial hurdles that often deter individuals from seeking necessary medical care. This approach not only alleviates the financial burden on employees but also provides employers with more flexible and cost-effective healthcare plan designs.</p><p>Brian Marsella, President of HPS and PayMedix, and Evan Peters, SVP of Networks at Gravie, both underscored the partnership's potential to make healthcare more accessible and affordable for Wisconsin families. By combining Gravie's level-funded approach with HPS's comprehensive provider network and PayMedix's payment solutions, this collaboration marks a significant step forward in creating a more inclusive and efficient healthcare system.</p><p>This initiative reflects a shared vision among the three organizations to prioritize member well-being and financial peace of mind, signaling a pivotal shift in how healthcare benefits are designed and delivered. For small and midsize businesses in Wisconsin, this partnership offers a promising solution to the challenges of healthcare access and affordability, potentially setting a new standard for healthcare benefits nationwide.</p></p>
