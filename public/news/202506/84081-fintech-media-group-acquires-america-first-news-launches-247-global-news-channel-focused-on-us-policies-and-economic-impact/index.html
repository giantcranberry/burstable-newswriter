          <p class='mb-4'><p>The recent acquisition of America First News (AFN) by FINTECH Media Group marks a significant expansion in the coverage of U.S. policies and their global economic implications. This strategic move relaunches AFN as a 24/7 globally distributed news channel, dedicated to delivering fact-driven reporting on how U.S. policies affect jobs, national security, and economic strength. The channel's focus on American factories and reshoring initiatives underscores the importance of bolstering U.S. employment and securing global supply chains, a topic of paramount interest to business and technology leaders.</p><p>AFN's coverage will extend to critical policy areas such as immigration enforcement, border security, tariffs, and technology sovereignty, presenting them as strategic tools for protecting workers and national interests. The introduction of the 'Mutual Investment Spotlight' feature will shed light on American companies investing overseas and foreign investments in the U.S., illustrating the mutual benefits of these economic exchanges. This initiative not only highlights the interconnectedness of global economies but also serves as a resource for leaders looking to navigate the complexities of international business and investment.</p><p>Accountability and oversight are central to AFN's mission, with plans to leverage GAO data and inspector general audits for watchdog reporting on federal agencies' inefficiencies. This commitment to transparency and measurable outcomes is expected to foster public trust and provide valuable insights into the effectiveness of government operations. The AFN Liberty & Leadership Awards further emphasize the channel's dedication to recognizing contributions to American economic interests and community resilience, offering a platform to celebrate achievements in job creation, mutual investment, and more.</p><p>With headquarters in Washington, D.C., and plans for global bureaus, AFN is poised to offer comprehensive coverage of allied economies and investment centers. This expansion reflects FINTECH Media Group's vision of enhancing understanding of how policy and investment decisions shape economic strength and public trust. For business and technology leaders, AFN's relaunch represents a timely resource for staying informed on the policies and trends that will define the future of global commerce and innovation.</p></p>
