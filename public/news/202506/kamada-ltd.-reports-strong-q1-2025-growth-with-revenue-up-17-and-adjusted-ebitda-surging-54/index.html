          <p class='mb-4'><p>Kamada Ltd. (NASDAQ: KMDA) has announced a remarkable first quarter for 2025, with revenues increasing by 17% to $44.0 million and Adjusted EBITDA jumping 54% to $11.6 million compared to the previous year. This growth highlights the company's successful execution of both organic growth strategies and strategic initiatives, as emphasized by CEO Amir London. The surge in revenue was primarily driven by robust sales of GLASSIA® and KAMRAB® in international markets, alongside significant contributions from VARIZIG® and royalty income from GLASSIA. These products play a vital role in addressing critical health issues, including treatments for emphysema caused by severe genetic Alpha 1-antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency, rabies prevention, and post-exposure prophylaxis of varicella disease in high-risk individuals.</p><p>The company's gross margins also saw an improvement, rising to 47% from 44% the previous year, attributed to a favorable product mix. Kamada has reaffirmed its full-year guidance, projecting total revenues to be between $178 million and $182 million, with adjusted EBITDA expected to range from $38 million to $42 million. These projections reflect the company's confidence in its growth trajectory and operational efficiency.</p><p>Among the quarter's notable achievements was the initiation of a post-marketing research program for CYTOGAM®, aimed at improving CMV disease management. Additionally, Kamada expanded its plasma collection capabilities with the opening of a new center in San Antonio, Texas, which is anticipated to contribute $8 million to $10 million in annual revenue once fully operational. The company also secured a significant deal to supply KAMRAB and VARIZIG in Latin America through 2027, expected to generate approximately $25 million in revenue. Progress on the InnovAATe clinical trial for inhaled Alpha-1 Antitrypsin therapy continues, with an interim futility analysis scheduled by the end of 2025.</p><p>Kamada's strategic focus on enhancing its product portfolio, expanding its plasma collection operations, and advancing clinical trials underscores its commitment to addressing unmet medical needs and securing a strong position in the biopharmaceutical sector. This quarter's performance not only demonstrates Kamada's financial health but also its potential to make a lasting impact on global healthcare through innovative treatments and therapies.</p></p>
