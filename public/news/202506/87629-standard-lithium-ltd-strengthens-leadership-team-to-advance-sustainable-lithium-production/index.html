          <p class='mb-4'><p>Standard Lithium Ltd. (NYSE American: SLI) has taken a decisive step towards bolstering its leadership team with the appointment of two industry veterans, signaling a strong push towards its sustainable lithium production goals. Daniel Rosen, joining as Vice President of Strategy and Investor Relations, and Tim Sobel, appointed as Vice President of Health, Safety, Social and Environment (HSSE), bring a wealth of experience that is expected to significantly benefit the company's strategic direction and operational safety standards.</p><p>Rosen's 13-year tenure in corporate strategy, finance, and capital markets, including roles at Rio Tinto and Arcadium Lithium, positions him as a key player in navigating Standard Lithium's financial and strategic landscapes. Sobel's over 30 years of expertise in global operational risk and safety, gained at DP World and Sunoco Logistics, underscores the company's commitment to maintaining the highest standards of health, safety, and environmental stewardship as it scales its operations.</p><p>CEO David Park emphasized the strategic significance of these appointments, highlighting the executives' proven leadership and extensive experience as critical assets for Standard Lithium as it moves closer to its first production milestone. The company is dedicated to the sustainable development of high-grade lithium-brine properties in the United States, with its flagship projects located in the Smackover Formation, which spans Arkansas and Texas. These projects are central to Standard Lithium's mission of achieving commercial-scale lithium production through its innovative direct lithium extraction and purification process.</p><p>This strategic enhancement of Standard Lithium's leadership team not only underscores the company's commitment to sustainable lithium production but also reflects its readiness to meet the growing global demand for lithium, a critical component in the manufacture of batteries for electric vehicles and renewable energy storage systems. The appointments of Rosen and Sobel are a clear indication of Standard Lithium's ambition to lead in the sustainable lithium sector, leveraging their expertise to navigate the challenges and opportunities ahead.</p></p>
