          <p class='mb-4'><p>Fortec Modern Real Estate, led by Chairman Pablo Barreiro, is making significant strides in bridging the gap between commercial real estate and early childhood education. With a career spanning over two decades in commercial real estate, Barreiro has positioned Fortec as a national leader in developing early education projects, with over $200 million completed to date. The company's latest initiative, a $100 million fund, aims to develop 50-60 early childhood education centers across the nation, addressing the acute shortage of childcare facilities in what are known as 'childcare deserts'.</p><p>The inspiration behind Fortec's specialized focus came from Barreiro's personal experience with a preschool in Hollywood, Florida, which his daughter attended. Recognizing the lack of developers catering to the preschool market, Fortec was established to fill this void. The company's expertise lies in creating educational environments that are not only compliant with zoning and licensing requirements but are also designed to enhance the learning experience for young children.</p><p>The $100 million fund represents a strategic move to inject institutional capital into the early childhood education sector, a critical yet underserved area. With approximately 51% of Americans residing in childcare deserts, the demand for accessible, high-quality early learning centers has never been higher. Fortec's development process, which includes a detailed 12-phase system, ensures that each project is optimized for both operational efficiency and educational outcomes.</p><p>As families increasingly prioritize proximity to quality childcare, Fortec's targeted approach to developing schools in underserved markets is both timely and impactful. By partnering with experienced operators, the company is not only expanding access to early childhood education but also creating sustainable investments that benefit communities and investors alike. Despite the fluctuating landscape of federal education policies, Fortec's focus on private early-learning operators provides a stable foundation for growth, supported by burgeoning state-level initiatives aimed at enhancing early childhood education.</p><p>Looking forward, Fortec is set to fully deploy its current fund and explore new markets, reinforcing its commitment to building schools that deliver both financial returns and social value. This initiative underscores the potential for real estate development to play a pivotal role in addressing some of the most pressing educational challenges facing the country today.</p></p>
