          <p class='mb-4'><p>The private credit market has rapidly evolved into a cornerstone of the financial ecosystem, particularly for small and mid-sized businesses (SMBs) that find traditional banking avenues increasingly inaccessible. FAVO Capital Inc. (OTC: FAVO) stands at the forefront of this transformation, offering innovative financing solutions that have already empowered over 10,000 small businesses with more than $138 million in funding. This surge in private credit availability comes at a critical time when SMBs face unprecedented economic challenges, highlighting the sector's importance in fostering business sustainability and growth.</p><p>Traditional banks, constrained by stringent regulations and a risk-averse lending approach, have inadvertently paved the way for alternative financing solutions to flourish. The private credit market's exponential growth, from $500 billion in assets under management in 2013 to an anticipated $1.7 trillion by 2025, reflects its escalating significance in the global economy. FAVO Capital's diverse portfolio, which includes revenue-based funding and merchant cash advances, exemplifies the adaptability and effectiveness of private credit in meeting the nuanced needs of SMBs across various industries.</p><p>The implications of FAVO Capital's success and the broader expansion of the private credit market are profound. For SMBs, access to flexible and timely financing can mean the difference between stagnation and expansion, especially in volatile economic climates. For the industry, the rise of private credit signals a shift towards more inclusive and responsive financial solutions, challenging traditional banking models to innovate. On a global scale, the growth of private credit underscores the potential for alternative financing to drive economic resilience, offering a blueprint for supporting small businesses worldwide. As FAVO Capital continues to lead by example, the private credit market's role in shaping the future of business financing becomes increasingly undeniable.</p></p>
