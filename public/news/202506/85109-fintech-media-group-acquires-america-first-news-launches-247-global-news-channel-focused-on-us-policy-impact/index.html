          <p class='mb-4'><p>The recent acquisition of America First News (AFN) by FINTECH Media Group marks a significant expansion in the coverage of how U.S. policies influence job creation, national security, and economic vitality. The rebranded AFN is set to operate as a 24/7 globally distributed news channel, with a focus on American manufacturing, reshoring efforts, and the broader implications of policies on immigration enforcement, border security, tariffs, and technology sovereignty. This move is poised to provide viewers with in-depth analysis and reporting on the strategies that protect workers and national interests, offering a unique perspective on the mutual investments between American companies and foreign entities.</p><p>AFN's programming will include the 'Mutual Investment Spotlight', a segment designed to showcase the flow of capital between the U.S. and other countries, highlighting how these financial exchanges contribute to domestic prosperity and international collaborations. Additionally, the channel will dedicate resources to accountability journalism, investigating inefficiencies and misconduct within federal agencies. This initiative will utilize data from the Government Accountability Office (GAO), inspector general audits, and real-world case studies to evaluate the effectiveness of the Department of Government Oversight & Efficiency (DOGE) and its impact on taxpayers.</p><p>The AFN Liberty & Leadership Awards will serve as a highlight of the channel's content, recognizing individuals and organizations that have made significant contributions to American economic interests and community resilience. Categories for the awards include Job Creation, Mutual Investment, Tech Sovereignty, Border & Immigration Policy, Government Accountability, and Local Champions & Veteran Leadership. Through these awards, AFN aims to celebrate achievements that align with its mission of promoting economic leadership, innovation, and policy accountability.</p><p>Accessibility is a key component of AFN's strategy, with content available across digital, television, mobile, podcast, and streaming platforms. Based in Washington, D.C., AFN also plans to establish global bureaus to cover allied economies and investment hubs, furthering its commitment to comprehensive, impact-focused journalism. This expansion reflects a growing demand for nuanced reporting on the intersections of policy, economy, and technology, offering leaders in business and technology news a valuable resource for understanding the implications of U.S. policies on a global scale.</p></p>
