          <p class='mb-4'><p>ShopBack, a platform that has significantly altered the shopping landscape in Asia-Pacific by providing cashback and rewards, is now making its foray into the U.S. market. This move is timely, as American consumers are increasingly seeking ways to maximize their spending power in the face of rising inflation. Founded in 2014 by Joel Leong and his co-founders, ShopBack has rapidly expanded to serve over 50 million shoppers across 13 markets, facilitating more than US$4 billion in annual sales for its merchant partners.</p><p>The platform distinguishes itself by offering real cashback that users can withdraw via PayPal, a feature that sets it apart from competitors offering points or rewards with limitations. Additionally, ShopBack enhances the shopping experience with gamified savings features, including quests, bonuses, and mobile games, making savings both engaging and rewarding. This innovative approach has been a key factor in the platform's success in Asia-Pacific and is expected to appeal to the U.S. market, particularly among younger, mobile-savvy consumers.</p><p>ShopBack's entry into the U.S. is bolstered by strategic partnerships with trusted brands like Walmart, indicating a promising start. The platform's mobile-first strategy is tailored to meet the preferences of on-the-go consumers, further positioning ShopBack as a formidable player in the U.S. e-commerce and fintech sectors. Joel Leong, Co-Founder of ShopBack, emphasizes the importance of understanding local consumer behavior and adapting the platform to diverse market needs, a strategy that has been instrumental in the platform's global growth.</p><p>As ShopBack aims to become the preferred platform for smarter spending in the U.S., its focus on delivering real utility and seamless savings experiences is expected to have a profound impact on the e-commerce landscape. With its proven model and commitment to innovation, ShopBack is well-positioned to redefine value-driven shopping for American consumers, offering them not just savings, but a more engaging and rewarding way to shop.</p></p>
