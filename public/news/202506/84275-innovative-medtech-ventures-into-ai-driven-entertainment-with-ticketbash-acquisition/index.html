          <p class='mb-4'><p>Innovative MedTech, Inc. (OTC:IMTH), a company previously focused on health and wellness services, has announced a strategic acquisition that marks its entry into the sports, entertainment, and media sectors. The company has agreed to acquire certain assets of Ticketbash, a ticket servicing company known for its proprietary AI software designed to improve transparency and cost efficiency in the ticket industry. This move represents a significant shift in Innovative MedTech's business strategy, underscoring the growing influence of artificial intelligence in transforming traditional sectors.</p><p>Michael Friedman, CEO of Innovative MedTech, described the acquisition as a critical step in the company's new direction towards developing AI sports and entertainment platforms. By integrating Ticketbash's AI technology, Innovative MedTech aims to unlock new business models and market opportunities, positioning itself as a leader in the application of advanced AI within these industries. The company is already engaging in discussions with emerging leaders in the sports industry for service deals and is exploring additional acquisition and joint venture opportunities to further its ambitions.</p><p>The financial structure of the deal includes an initial cash payment, the issuance of preferred stock to Ticketbash's owners, and future royalties contingent upon achieving specific revenue milestones. This approach not only facilitates the acquisition but also aligns the interests of both parties towards the successful integration and growth of the combined technologies and markets.</p><p>In light of its strategic pivot, Innovative MedTech is evaluating options for its existing healthcare businesses, including the potential sale of its SarahCare subsidiaries and a spin-off of its Oral Thrush product. This transition reflects a broader industry trend where companies are leveraging technological advancements to explore new growth avenues in the rapidly evolving digital landscape. The acquisition of Ticketbash by Innovative MedTech is a testament to the transformative potential of AI across diverse industries, offering insights into how traditional businesses can adapt and thrive in the age of digital innovation.</p></p>
