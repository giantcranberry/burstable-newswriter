          <p class='mb-4'><p>Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati, a premier legal services provider to the technology and life sciences industries, has announced the hiring of Jean Witz as senior patent counsel in its Washington, D.C., office. Witz's arrival marks a significant enhancement to the firm's intellectual property (IP) law practice, offering clients deep expertise in biotechnology, pharmaceuticals, and chemical engineering patents.</p><p>With nearly 40 years of experience at the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), Witz has played critical roles in shaping the quality and consistency of patent examinations. Her tenure includes serving as a supervisory patent reexamination specialist and a quality assurance specialist, where her work directly impacted the rigor and fairness of the patent process in vital scientific domains.</p><p>Dr. Louis Lieto, who leads the Patents and Innovations Department at Wilson Sonsini, pointed out that Witz's intimate knowledge of the USPTO's inner workings and decision-making processes will be invaluable to clients. This insight is particularly crucial as businesses navigate the increasingly complex and competitive landscape of IP rights.</p><p>Beyond her USPTO experience, Witz's career includes pivotal roles at Battelle Laboratories and Hazelton Laboratories, where she developed expertise in evaluating drug toxicity data for FDA submissions. This unique combination of scientific acumen and regulatory experience positions her as a key resource for life sciences companies seeking to protect their innovations.</p><p>Michael Rosato, head of the firm’s USPTO Contested Proceedings practice, noted the timeliness of Witz's addition. Her ability to train USPTO examiners and her comprehensive understanding of the patent examination process are expected to provide Wilson Sonsini's clients with a strategic advantage in high-stakes IP disputes.</p><p>Witz's contributions to the field have been recognized with prestigious awards, including the USPTO Exceptional Career Award and the AIPLA Distinguished Service Award. Her academic background, featuring degrees in biology and a J.D. from George Washington University, further underscores her qualifications. Additionally, Witz has dedicated over three decades to teaching, enriching the next generation of professionals in biology and IP law.</p><p>Expressing her excitement about the new role, Witz is eager to leverage her vast experience to guide clients through the patent system with accuracy and strategic insight. Her appointment reflects Wilson Sonsini's ongoing commitment to excellence in IP law, ensuring that clients receive expert advice in an ever-evolving legal and technological environment.</p></p>
