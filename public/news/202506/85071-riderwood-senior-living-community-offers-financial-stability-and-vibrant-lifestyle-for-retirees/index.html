          <p class='mb-4'><p>The transition to Riderwood, an Erickson Senior Living community in Silver Spring, Md., has offered Joe and Beverly Limansky a worry-free retirement, free from the burdens of home maintenance and unpredictable expenses. The couple, previously residents of a large house in Boca Raton, Fla., found solace in Riderwood's financial model, which includes a monthly service package covering utilities, meals, maintenance, and more, alongside a 90% refundable entrance fee. This model caters to the preferences of over 90% of seniors who seek predictable monthly expenses for their daily needs, as highlighted by a survey commissioned by Erickson Senior Living.</p><p>Riderwood's approach not only simplifies financial planning for retirees but also ensures that the entrance fee is returned to residents or their beneficiaries upon leaving the community, a feature that sets it apart from other senior living options. Sales Director Josh Runkles points to the community's commitment to reinvesting in services and amenities, ensuring a vibrant and up-to-date living environment for all residents.</p><p>Beyond the financial advantages, Riderwood boasts a comprehensive suite of activities and amenities, including a state-of-the-art fitness center, eight restaurants, and over 240 clubs and activities. The Limanskys have fully embraced this active lifestyle, engaging in tai chi, square dancing, and various exercise classes. The community's Home for Life promise, guaranteeing that no resident will be asked to leave due to financial hardship, adds an extra layer of security and peace of mind for its residents. 'In every way, Riderwood has exceeded our expectations,' Joe remarks, underscoring the freedom, value, and peace of mind they've discovered in their new home.</p><p>This model of senior living not only addresses the immediate needs of retirees like the Limanskys but also sets a precedent for how communities can offer financial stability and a high quality of life for seniors. The implications of such a model are vast, potentially influencing the broader senior living industry to adopt more transparent and resident-friendly financial structures, thereby enhancing the retirement experience for future generations.</p></p>
