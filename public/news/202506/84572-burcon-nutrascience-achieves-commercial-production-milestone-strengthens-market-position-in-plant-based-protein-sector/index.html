          <p class='mb-4'><p>Burcon Nutrascience Corporation has marked a significant achievement in the plant-based protein sector by successfully scaling up commercial production of its pea protein isolate at its Galesburg facility. This milestone, achieved in less than 90 days, is a critical step in Burcon's go-to-market strategy, enabling the company to meet increasing customer demand and tap into a market with a total addressable market estimated between US$215M and US$392M.</p><p>In a strategic move to bolster its financial standing, Burcon has announced a share consolidation program at a 20:1 ratio, set to commence on June 11, 2025. This initiative reflects the company's dedication to optimizing its capital structure and strengthening its market position.</p><p>The collaboration with ProMan in the third quarter of 2025 represents another leap forward for Burcon. This partnership allows Burcon to adopt a capital-light approach by leasing a protein production facility from ProMan, ensuring full control over its plant-based protein production. With production expected to start within 90 days, Burcon is confident in achieving its revenue targets, projecting first-year sales between $1M and $3M, and surpassing $10M in the second year, with profitability and positive cash flows anticipated by FY26.</p><p>Burcon's innovation in product commercialization is evident through its collaborations with Puratos to explore new applications for canola protein and the introduction of next-generation Peazazz® pea protein and Puratein® canola protein for egg replacement applications. The launch of Solatein™ sunflower protein isolate further diversifies Burcon's product offerings, catering to a broader market segment.</p><p>Financially, Burcon has shown progress with $0.06M in revenues from protein isolate sales and contract research services in 3Q25, a notable improvement from no revenues in the same quarter the previous year. Despite a net loss of $1.8M, or $0.01 per share, the company has demonstrated resilience, showing improvement from a net loss of $2.0M, or $0.02 per share, in the same period last year. With a pro-forma cash balance of approximately $10.0M following a successful rights offering, Burcon is well-equipped to continue its growth and innovation in the rapidly expanding plant-based protein market.</p></p>
