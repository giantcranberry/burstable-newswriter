          <p class='mb-4'><p>Hedgeye Asset Management, LLC, a key player in the investment management sector, has taken a significant step forward by appointing David Salem and Sam Rahman as Portfolio Managers. This move is designed to enhance the firm's ability to deliver top-tier investment research and strategies through its ETF offerings, making them more accessible to a broader audience. The addition of Salem and Rahman, both with impressive backgrounds in managing substantial investment portfolios, signals Hedgeye's commitment to strengthening its team with seasoned professionals who bring a depth of knowledge and experience to the table.</p><p>David Salem's career includes a notable tenure as President and Chief Investment Officer of The Investment Fund for Foundations (TIFF), where he managed over $8 billion for more than 800 endowed charities. His collaboration with Jeremy Grantham at GMO further highlights his expertise in crafting and managing commingled funds for major U.S. foundations. Similarly, Sam Rahman's 15-year experience at Crosby Advisors, the Fidelity family office, where he managed a multi-billion-dollar strategy focused on long-term capital appreciation, adds significant value to Hedgeye's team. His direct work under Ned Johnson, Fidelity Investments Founder and Chairman, underscores his deep understanding of investment strategies and market dynamics.</p><p>John McNamara, Chief Investment Officer at Hedgeye Asset Management, highlighted how Salem and Rahman's institutional experience aligns with CEO Keith McCullough's vision of making elite investment research more accessible. Their expertise is expected to play a crucial role in enhancing the firm's ETF offerings, thereby providing all investors with access to sophisticated investment strategies. The anticipated commencement of Salem and Rahman's roles in the second quarter of 2025 marks a pivotal moment for Hedgeye Asset Management as it continues to expand its investment management expertise and offerings, setting a new standard in the industry.</p></p>
