          <p class='mb-4'><p>Heidmar Maritime Holdings Corp., a leader in the maritime transportation sector with over 40 years of experience, has announced a strategic partnership with B2i Digital, Inc. This collaboration is designed to enhance Heidmar's visibility among investors by leveraging B2i Digital's expertise in digital marketing and investor relations. The partnership highlights Heidmar's commitment to innovation and operational excellence, particularly through its proprietary eFleetWatch platform, which offers real-time vessel tracking and operational transparency.</p><p>David Shapiro, CEO of B2i Digital, pointed out the unique investment opportunity Heidmar presents, emphasizing its managed fleet of 51 vessels and its strategic positioning in the global shipping industry. Pankaj Khanna, Heidmar's CEO, views this partnership as a critical step in the company's strategy to enhance shareholder value and maintain high service standards for its clients. Since Khanna took the helm in 2019, Heidmar has significantly expanded its managed fleet from seven to 51 vessels, demonstrating robust growth and operational capability.</p><p>Heidmar's global presence is bolstered by offices in major maritime hubs such as Athens, London, and Singapore, with plans to expand into Houston.

This partnership with B2i Digital underscores Heidmar's forward-looking approach, aiming to leverage digital strategies to communicate its achievements and future potential to a broader investor audience.</p><p>For investors and stakeholders in the maritime transportation sector, this partnership represents a significant development. It not only showcases Heidmar's operational capabilities and technological advancements but also provides a clearer window into the company's strategic direction and growth potential. As the global shipping industry continues to evolve, partnerships like this one are pivotal in bridging the gap between traditional maritime operations and the digital age, offering new opportunities for investment and growth in the sector.</p></p>
