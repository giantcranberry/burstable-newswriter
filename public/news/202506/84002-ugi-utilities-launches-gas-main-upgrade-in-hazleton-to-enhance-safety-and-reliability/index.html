          <p class='mb-4'><p>UGI Utilities has initiated a critical infrastructure upgrade in Hazleton, targeting the replacement of an aging gas main on Berner Avenue. This project, set to commence on June 24, underscores UGI's commitment to ensuring the safety and reliability of its natural gas distribution system. The upgrade, occurring between South Cedar Street and South Poplar Street, is a proactive measure to prevent potential service disruptions and enhance the overall efficiency of the gas supply to the community.</p><p>The construction schedule, running from 7am to 5pm on weekdays, will inevitably lead to temporary inconveniences, including road closures and parking restrictions. UGI has assured that while access for residents and businesses within the construction zone will be maintained, some natural gas service interruptions are expected. The company plans to conduct necessary inspections and relight equipment on properties affected by the service restoration process, emphasizing its dedication to minimizing disruption.</p><p>With an estimated completion date in mid-July, the project's timeline is subject to variations due to weather and unforeseen working conditions. Following the underground work, UGI will undertake final paving and restoration efforts to ensure the area is returned to its original state. This project not only represents a significant investment in the local infrastructure but also offers an opportunity for the community to consider the benefits of natural gas. UGI is actively encouraging homes and businesses along the project route to explore converting to natural gas, highlighting its advantages as a cleaner and more efficient energy source.</p><p>As a utility provider serving over 760,000 customers, UGI's initiative in Hazleton is a testament to its broader mission of delivering reliable energy solutions through continuous infrastructure improvements. This project is a clear indication of how utility companies are addressing the dual challenges of maintaining aging infrastructure while promoting sustainable energy options. For the residents and businesses of Hazleton, the upgrade promises enhanced service reliability and safety, marking a step forward in the community's energy resilience.</p></p>
