          <p class='mb-4'><p>Stradley Ronon has significantly enhanced its litigation and investigations team by welcoming Jordann Conaboy and Benjamin McCoy as partners in its Philadelphia office. Both attorneys join from Fox Rothschild, bringing with them a deep well of expertise in complex litigation, particularly in the health care, managed care, pharmaceutical, and commercial sectors. Their arrival is poised to strengthen the firm's ability to tackle the intricate regulatory and litigation challenges that define these industries.</p><p>Jeff Grossman, co-chair of the firm's litigation practice, emphasized the strategic value of Conaboy and McCoy's appointments. Their collective experience spans managed care claims disputes, fraud, RICO claims, and government investigations, offering clients a formidable defense and affirmative litigation services. Notably, their careers have been marked by securing judgments and settlements totaling hundreds of millions of dollars in fraud cases, alongside defending clients in high-stakes litigation across numerous states.</p><p>Conaboy's distinguished background includes serving as an assistant U.S. attorney in the District of New Jersey, where he prosecuted criminal cases and managed affirmative civil enforcement matters. His involvement in some of the Department of Justice's most significant and complex cases within the health care and pharmaceutical sectors has garnered him prestigious recognition, including the 2024 Federal Law Enforcement Prosecutor of the Year Award.</p><p>McCoy's expertise lies in representing health insurers and plan administrators in affirmative civil suits against large-scale health care fraud operations. His focus on cases involving sober living homes, pass-through billing, and COVID-19 testing fraud aligns with Conaboy's government-side experience, creating a comprehensive approach to health care litigation at Stradley Ronon.</p><p>This strategic hiring is part of Stradley Ronon's ongoing effort to expand its litigation, health care, managed care, white collar, and insurance practices. It follows the recent addition of a five-lawyer insurance/reinsurance litigation team in New York and Washington, D.C., highlighting the firm's dedication to offering exhaustive legal services in these pivotal areas. The inclusion of Conaboy and McCoy not only broadens the firm's expertise but also reinforces its position as a leader in navigating the complex legal landscapes of health care and commercial litigation.</p></p>
