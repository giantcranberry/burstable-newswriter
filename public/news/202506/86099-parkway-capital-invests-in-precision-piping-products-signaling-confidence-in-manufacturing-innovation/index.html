          <p class='mb-4'><p>Parkway Capital has announced its investment in Precision Piping Products (P3), a Houston-based company known for its innovative flange protectors. This move, part of a recapitalization effort involving Tico Capital Partners and 7 Seas Capital, along with P3's senior management, marks a significant step in supporting specialized manufacturing solutions. P3's proprietary adhesive process for protecting flanges and pipes from damage during transit and construction positions it as a leader in its niche market.</p><p>Specializing in mezzanine debt and minority equity investments, Parkway Capital's commitment to P3 reflects its strategy to invest in companies with strong growth potential within the manufacturing sector. Since its founding in 2014, P3 has developed patented technologies that have secured its position in the market, making it an attractive investment for Parkway Capital. This addition to Parkway Capital's portfolio, which includes over 70 companies across various industries, further diversifies its investments in manufacturing and related sectors.</p><p>Calvert Street Investment Partners, Parkway Capital's parent company, has a history of investing over $1.1 billion in more than 145 middle-market companies. The investment in P3 not only expands Parkway Capital's presence in the manufacturing sector but also reinforces its commitment to providing flexible capital solutions to lower-middle market companies. The collaboration between Parkway Capital, Tico Capital Partners, and 7 Seas Capital in this transaction highlights the role of strategic partnerships in fostering innovation and growth in the manufacturing industry.</p><p>This investment is more than a financial boost for P3; it signifies confidence in the manufacturing sector's ability to innovate and grow, especially in specialized areas like flange protection. For the industry, it underscores the value of investing in companies that blend technological advancements with practical applications, ensuring the sector's long-term sustainability. For business and technology leaders, this development emphasizes the critical role of strategic investments in driving innovation and supporting the industrial economy's foundational elements.</p></p>
