          <p class='mb-4'><p>The Surety & Fidelity Association of America (SFAA) recently convened its 117th Annual Meeting, a pivotal event that not only celebrated the election of a new Board of Directors and Executive Committee but also outlined a forward-looking strategy for the surety and fidelity industry. Led by SFAA Chair Mike Keimig and SFAA President & CEO Ryan Work, the gathering underscored the critical role of innovation, collaboration, and sustained engagement in addressing the complexities of today's market.</p><p>Among the highlights was the presentation of the 2025 Surety Platinum Award to Ralph Pulver, recognizing his exceptional leadership and contributions to the industry over decades. The Surety Association of Ohio and the San Diego Surety Association were also acknowledged with the 2025 Silver Surety Awards for their outstanding efforts in member engagement, education, and advocacy.</p><p>Keynote speaker Sam Jordan from the Future Today Strategy Group captivated attendees with a discussion on the transformative potential of technology and data-driven strategies in the surety industry. The event further benefited from insights shared by U.S. Congressman Addison McDowell, who discussed the importance of advancing national infrastructure priorities, a sector deeply intertwined with the surety and fidelity industry.</p><p>The newly elected 2025–2026 SFAA Board of Directors and Executive Committee, featuring industry stalwarts like Michael Keimig of Markel Surety Corporation and Stephen Ruschak of Arch Insurance Group Inc., reflects a broad spectrum of expertise poised to steer the SFAA's mission. This mission focuses on promoting the value of surety and fidelity bonding through advocacy, education, and innovation, leveraging new staff expertise, enhanced data analytics, and emerging technologies.</p><p>With its 425 member companies responsible for 98 percent of surety and fidelity bonds in the U.S., the SFAA's influence on the industry's trajectory is undeniable. The outcomes of this year's Annual Meeting not only celebrate past achievements but also chart a course for a resilient and collaborative future, ensuring the industry's readiness to meet the challenges and opportunities ahead.</p></p>
