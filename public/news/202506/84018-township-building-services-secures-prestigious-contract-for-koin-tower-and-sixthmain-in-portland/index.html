          <p class='mb-4'><p>Township Building Services, a leader in janitorial and building services, has achieved a notable milestone by being selected as the official service partner for the KOIN Tower and Sixth+Main in Portland. This contract not only signifies Township's growing influence in the Pacific Northwest but also its unwavering dedication to upholding the highest service standards in Class A commercial properties. The KOIN Tower, standing as one of Portland's tallest and most recognizable skyscrapers, along with Sixth+Main, a modern office complex celebrated for its professional ambiance and architectural beauty, are both under the management of Jones Lang LaSalle, a real estate investment trust known for its excellence in operational management.</p><p>The selection of Township Building Services came after a rigorous evaluation process, where the company's consistent delivery of high-quality janitorial services and building maintenance distinguished it from competitors. Township's methodology, which emphasizes customized service programs, extensive training, and fostering long-term relationships with clients and tenants, played a pivotal role in securing this prestigious contract. Travis Gill, President of Township, expressed pride in this achievement, stating, "We are honored to be entrusted with such marquee properties. This opportunity reflects the exceptional work our teams deliver daily and our commitment to bringing our signature service model to Portland's most respected addresses."</p><p>This partnership is a testament to Township's strategic expansion on the West Coast, following successful collaborations with other landmark properties in major urban centers. The company continues to prioritize service partnerships that focus on client satisfaction, empowering employees, and contributing positively to the community. For business and technology leaders, this development highlights the importance of selecting service providers that not only meet but exceed the operational and aesthetic standards of high-profile commercial properties, ensuring a conducive environment for business operations and tenant satisfaction.</p></p>
