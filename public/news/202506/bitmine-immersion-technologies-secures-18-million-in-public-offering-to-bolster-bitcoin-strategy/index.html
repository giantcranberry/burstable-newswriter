          <p class='mb-4'><p>BitMine Immersion Technologies, Inc. (NYSE American: BMNR) has marked a significant milestone with the closure of its underwritten public offering, amassing $18 million in gross proceeds before expenses. The offering, which saw the sale of 2,250,000 shares at $8.00 each, commenced trading on the NYSE American on June 5, 2025. This financial endeavor not only underscores the company's robust market presence but also includes a 45-day option for underwriters to acquire an additional 337,500 shares to cover over-allotments, further enhancing BitMine's financial flexibility.</p><p>The capital raised is strategically allocated towards the acquisition of Bitcoin, reflecting BitMine's comprehensive investment strategy that spans direct Bitcoin mining, synthetic Bitcoin mining, and hashrate as a financial product. Moreover, BitMine extends its expertise through advisory and mining services to organizations aiming to generate Bitcoin-denominated revenues, illustrating its diversified approach to capitalizing on the cryptocurrency market's potential.</p><p>Operational efficiency is at the core of BitMine's strategy, with its mining activities strategically situated in low-cost energy regions such as Trinidad; Pecos, Texas; and Silverton, Texas. These locations are instrumental in reducing operational expenses and optimizing the profitability of Bitcoin mining. BitMine's unwavering focus on Bitcoin accumulation, whether through mining or capital raising initiatives, highlights its dedication to harnessing the cryptocurrency's long-term growth prospects.</p><p>ThinkEquity's role as the sole book-running manager was pivotal in facilitating BitMine's successful navigation of the capital markets. This public offering not only furnishes BitMine with the essential resources to propel its Bitcoin accumulation strategy forward but also mirrors the escalating investor enthusiasm for cryptocurrency-centric ventures. As the digital currency domain continues to advance, BitMine's innovative methodologies and strategic investments position it as a key contender in the evolving cryptocurrency industry.</p></p>
