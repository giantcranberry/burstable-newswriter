          <p class='mb-4'><p>WTW, a global leader in advisory, broking, and solutions, has made strategic leadership appointments within its Health, Wealth & Career division, signaling a strong commitment to growth and innovation in employee benefits and risk management. Eric McMurray, currently the global head of Health & Benefits, will assume the role of Chairman, Health, Wealth & Career, effective July 1. In his new capacity, McMurray will concentrate on mergers and acquisitions readiness, strategy execution, client growth, and senior leadership development, areas critical to WTW's mission of delivering comprehensive solutions to its clients.</p><p>Anne Pullum steps into McMurray's previous role as the leader of the global Health & Benefits business, while continuing her responsibilities as co-head of Corporate Development. Pullum's extensive experience, including leadership positions in Corporate Risk & Broking for Europe and strategy for WTW, positions her uniquely to drive the Health & Benefits business forward. Her dual roles highlight WTW's strategy of blending consulting and broking expertise to offer superior health and benefits solutions.</p><p>Julie Gebauer, President of Health, Wealth & Career, commended McMurray for his transformative leadership and expressed optimism about Pullum's ability to innovate and expand the business. These leadership changes are part of WTW's broader strategy to adapt to the changing needs of organizations and their employees, focusing on data-driven and insight-led solutions that address people, risk, and capital challenges. The appointments underscore WTW's dedication to fostering resilience and innovation in its services, ensuring it remains at the forefront of the industry.</p><p>For business and technology leaders, these developments at WTW highlight the importance of strategic leadership in navigating the complexities of the modern benefits landscape. As organizations worldwide grapple with evolving workforce needs and the integration of technology in benefits administration, WTW's focus on leadership and innovation offers a blueprint for delivering value in a competitive market. The implications of these appointments extend beyond WTW, suggesting a trend towards more integrated and strategic approaches to health, wealth, and career solutions in the industry.</p></p>
