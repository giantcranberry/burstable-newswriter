          <p class='mb-4'><p>Nicola Mining Inc., a junior resource company with a focus on mineral assets in British Columbia, has announced a strategic partnership with IBN to bolster its corporate communications and investor outreach efforts. This collaboration is set to utilize IBN's vast investor-focused distribution network, aiming to significantly increase Nicola Mining's brand visibility and awareness among a broad audience of investors, industry professionals, and market influencers.</p><p>The company distinguishes itself through an innovative operational strategy that merges revenue generation from its wholly owned gold and silver mill with the exploration potential of copper, silver, and gold projects. This dual approach not only facilitates the funding of ongoing development activities but also strategically minimizes equity dilution, presenting a compelling value proposition to investors.</p><p>Through this partnership, Nicola Mining will gain access to IBN's extensive network, which includes over 5,000 syndication outlets such as newsletters, social media channels, and wire services via InvestorWire. This comprehensive communications strategy is designed to effectively convey Nicola Mining's strategic initiatives and long-term growth potential to a diverse and global audience.</p><p>Nicola Mining's portfolio includes a fully permitted mill and tailings facility near Merritt, British Columbia, notable for being the province's only third-party processing facility of its kind. Additionally, the company holds full ownership of the New Craigmont Copper Project, adjacent to Canada's largest copper mine, and the Treasure Mountain Silver Project. These assets underscore Nicola Mining's commitment to leveraging high-quality mineral assets for sustainable growth and value creation.</p><p>The partnership with IBN marks a significant step forward for Nicola Mining as it seeks to enhance its market presence and articulate its strategic vision to potential investors and stakeholders in the mining sector. This move is indicative of the company's proactive approach to corporate communications and investor relations, aiming to secure a competitive edge in the resource industry.</p></p>
