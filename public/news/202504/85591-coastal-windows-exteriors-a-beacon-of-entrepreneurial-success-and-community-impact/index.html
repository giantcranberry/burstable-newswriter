          <p class='mb-4'><p>Stephanie Vanderbilt's entrepreneurial story with Coastal Windows & Exteriors serves as a compelling example of how determination, mentorship, and a focus on sustainability can drive small business success. Starting in 2011 without any prior experience in the home improvement industry, Vanderbilt has transformed her company into a regional leader in exterior remodeling, serving areas across Eastern Massachusetts, Southern New Hampshire, and Southern Maine. Her journey underscores the pivotal role of the Massachusetts Small Business Development Center (MSBDC) in providing the initial guidance that helped her focus on energy-efficient upgrades, a niche that has become increasingly relevant in today's eco-conscious market.</p><p>Under Vanderbilt's leadership, Coastal Windows & Exteriors has not only achieved significant business growth but also garnered industry recognition, including the prestigious GAF President's Club Award and the James Hardie Service Excellence Award. These accolades reflect the company's commitment to quality and innovation in offering high-performance roofing and windows services. Beyond its business achievements, the company stands out for its deep commitment to social responsibility, with initiatives like Roof for Heroes and the Freedom from Want Thanksgiving Project showcasing its dedication to giving back to the community.</p><p>The story of Coastal Windows & Exteriors is particularly noteworthy for its emphasis on women's leadership in the trades, a sector traditionally dominated by men. As a woman-owned, family-run business, it challenges stereotypes and paves the way for future generations of female entrepreneurs. The feature of Vanderbilt's story by the SBA highlights her contributions to small business development and economic empowerment, serving as an inspiration for aspiring entrepreneurs. This narrative is a testament to the transformative power of small businesses in driving economic growth, fostering community engagement, and promoting sustainable practices.</p></p>
