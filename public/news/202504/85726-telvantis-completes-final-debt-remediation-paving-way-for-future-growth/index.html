          <p class='mb-4'><p>Telvantis, operating under its new brand identity after a significant rebranding from Raadr Inc., has announced the successful completion of its final round of debt remediation. This milestone marks the end of a comprehensive restructuring effort aimed at addressing years of legacy financial challenges. Under the stewardship of CEO Daniel Contreras, the company has not only settled outstanding liabilities but also rebranded and repositioned itself as a telecommunications and technology hybrid, with a keen focus on Communications Platform as a Service (CPaaS).</p><p>The restructuring process has yielded several key achievements, including the development of a multi-stream revenue platform that exceeds $300 million, the securing of over 300 global carrier relationships, and enhanced corporate transparency through strategic financial disclosures. With no remaining legacy liabilities, Telvantis now enjoys unprecedented operational flexibility, enabling it to focus on future growth and innovation.</p><p>Looking ahead, Telvantis has outlined a strategic roadmap that includes completing financial audits, pursuing potential uplisting, launching enterprise products with AI integration, and expanding its global partnership network. CFO Daniel Gilcher highlighted the company's ambition to scale toward $1 billion in annual sales, underscoring the transformative potential of the recent restructuring.</p><p>Through strategic acquisitions in the United States and Ireland, Telvantis is well-positioned to capitalize on emerging 5G technologies and cloud-based communication platforms. This forward-looking approach not only aims to establish market leadership but also reflects the company's commitment to technological innovation and market expansion. With the debt remediation chapter closed, Telvantis is now fully focused on executing its growth-oriented strategy and increasing shareholder value in an evolving technological landscape.</p></p>
