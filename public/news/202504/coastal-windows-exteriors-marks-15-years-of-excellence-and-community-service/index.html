          <p class='mb-4'><p>Coastal Windows & Exteriors, a Beverly-based home exterior remodeling company, has reached a significant milestone, celebrating 15 years of transformative service and dedication to community empowerment. Founded by Stephanie and David Vanderbilt, the company has established itself as a leader in the industry, not only for its energy-efficient home improvements but also for its unwavering commitment to social responsibility.</p><p>In 2024, Coastal Windows & Exteriors achieved remarkable recognition, including four prestigious national honors. Among these, the James Hardie President's Club Award stands out, a distinction earned by only 33 companies nationwide. Notably, Coastal is the sole woman-owned contractor to receive this award, highlighting its unique position in the industry. This accolade, along with the James Hardie Service Excellence Award, which reflects a 97% customer recommendation rate through GuildQuality, underscores the company's commitment to excellence.</p><p>The company's achievements extend beyond national awards. Rankings in the Qualified Remodeler HIP 200 & Top 500 further solidify Coastal's status as a top-tier remodeling firm in the United States. Stephanie Vanderbilt, a former teacher of the deaf and the driving force behind the company, was recognized as the SBA Massachusetts Business Person of the Year. This honor emphasizes her leadership and the substantial impact the company has had on the community.</p><p>At the heart of Coastal Windows & Exteriors' success is a founding philosophy centered on educating and empowering customers, rather than simply selling services. This approach has not only fostered trust and loyalty among customers but has also contributed to the company's impressive accumulation of over 700 5-star Google reviews. Holding credentials as a GAF Master Elite Roofer and James Hardie Elite Preferred Contractor, Coastal has demonstrated a consistent commitment to customer satisfaction and exceptional craftsmanship.</p><p>Beyond its business achievements, Coastal Windows & Exteriors has made significant charitable contributions, embodying its commitment to giving back. Initiatives like the Roofs for Heroes program, which donates roofs to veterans, and partnerships with Habitat for Humanity, resulting in over $300,000 in labor and material contributions, highlight the company's dedication to community service. Seasonal giving drives to support local food pantries further illustrate Coastal's holistic approach to business, where success is measured not just in awards and revenue, but in the positive impact on the community.</p><p>As Coastal Windows & Exteriors enters its 16th year, the company continues to set an example for how businesses can thrive while prioritizing community service, customer education, and exceptional craftsmanship. Its story is a testament to the power of combining professional excellence with a deep commitment to making a difference in the lives of others.</p></p>
