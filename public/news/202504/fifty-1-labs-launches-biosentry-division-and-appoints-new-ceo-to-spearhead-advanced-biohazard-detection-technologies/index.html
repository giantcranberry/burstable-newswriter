          <p class='mb-4'><p>Fifty 1 Labs, Inc. (OTC: FITY) has embarked on a transformative journey with the appointment of Michael Lawson as its new CEO and Chairman, alongside the introduction of its groundbreaking BioSentry Division. This division is set to revolutionize the field of real-time biohazard detection by harnessing the power of PCR, spectrometry, and AI-driven analytics. The initiative underscores the company's dedication to pioneering technologies that safeguard public health, defense, and industrial environments from biological, chemical, and environmental threats.</p><p>The strategic partnership with UAV Corp (OTC: UMAV) further amplifies Fifty 1 Labs' capabilities, enabling the integration of its advanced sensor systems with unmanned aerial vehicles. This collaboration not only enhances the operational scope of biohazard detection but also promises to deliver added value to shareholders through a planned UAV Corp share dividend. The decision to forgo the Genetic Networks acquisition in favor of pursuing Department of Defense contracts highlights the company's focused approach to leveraging its core technological strengths for high-impact applications.</p><p>Under the continued guidance of key leaders Brandon Spikes and Robert Clark, Fifty 1 Labs is poised to make significant strides in the biotechnology and safety sectors. The BioSentry Division's launch is a testament to the company's innovative spirit and its commitment to addressing some of the most pressing detection and safety challenges of our time. By merging advanced sensing technologies with artificial intelligence, Fifty 1 Labs is not just advancing its corporate objectives but is also contributing to a safer and healthier world.</p></p>
