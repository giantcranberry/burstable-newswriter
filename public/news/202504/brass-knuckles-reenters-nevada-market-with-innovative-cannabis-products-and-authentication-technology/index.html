          <p class='mb-4'><p>The cannabis industry witnesses a significant development as Brass Knuckles, a legacy brand, makes its strategic return to the Nevada market. This comeback is facilitated through a partnership with Caliente Partners Group and the integration of Lucid Green's authentication technology, marking a pivotal moment for both the brand and the state's cannabis sector. Brass Knuckles is set to offer its premium cannabis products across several Las Vegas retail locations, including Planet 13, Jardin, Shango, Inyo, and Cookies Flamingo, introducing consumers to high-quality extracts and innovative technology.</p><p>Founder Mike Healy highlights the brand's dedication to quality and innovation, with the introduction of three distinct extraction types: Super Premium Distillate, Live Liquid Diamonds, and Live Resin. The All-In-One (AIO) hardware further exemplifies Brass Knuckles' commitment to enhancing the consumer experience, setting a new benchmark in product development within the cannabis industry.</p><p>A standout feature of this relaunch is the adoption of Lucid Green's authentication technology. Through the use of LucidIDs, consumers can now verify the authenticity of their purchases and access vital consumption information by simply scanning a QR code. This move addresses the increasing consumer demand for transparency and safety in cannabis products, reinforcing Brass Knuckles' position as a leader in consumer trust and product integrity.</p><p>The strategic partnership with Caliente Partners Group underscores a calculated approach to reestablishing Brass Knuckles in Nevada's competitive cannabis landscape. By leveraging premium genetics, cutting-edge hardware, and consumer-centric authentication methods, the brand is not only rebuilding its reputation but also contributing to the evolution of industry standards for quality and transparency. This development is a clear indicator of the growing sophistication of the cannabis market, where technology and consumer trust play central roles in shaping the future of the industry.</p></p>
