          <p class='mb-4'><p>Florida Boy Burger Co., a fast-casual restaurant chain celebrated for its Old-Florida dining experience, is embarking on a significant expansion across Florida. By 2025, the chain will open four new locations in Orlando, Jacksonville, Naples, and North Port, each designed to reflect Florida's cultural and natural heritage. This expansion, spearheaded by co-founder Roger Lolly, not only broadens the company's reach but also underscores its commitment to local sourcing, community engagement, and environmental stewardship.</p><p>The new restaurants will feature unique design elements such as reclaimed cypress bars and educational taxidermy displays, alongside a 500-gallon freshwater tank housing live baby alligators, in collaboration with the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. The menu, focusing on locally sourced ingredients, will include hand-pressed chuck-and-brisket patties topped with region-inspired flavors. A new supply agreement with Panhandle cattle ranchers is set to ensure all beef is Florida-raised by late 2025.</p><p>This expansion represents a substantial economic boost, with each location involving a $1.6 million investment and creating 35 to 40 jobs. To uphold quality during this growth phase, Florida Boy Burger Co. is establishing a centralized training hub in Fort Myers. Beyond business growth, the company remains dedicated to its 'Burgers for the Bay' initiative, supporting Everglades restoration and organizing monthly waterway clean-ups.</p><p>Looking ahead, Florida Boy Burger Co. is considering expansion into neighboring Southeastern markets by 2026, leveraging strategic partnerships. This growth strategy highlights the company's innovative approach to combining culinary excellence with storytelling and environmental responsibility, attracting both developers and investors interested in sustainable and community-focused business models.</p></p>
