          <p class='mb-4'><p>Mullen Automotive, a prominent electric vehicle manufacturer based in Southern California, has recently announced a substantial order for its Mullen THREE electric trucks from Cashflow on Wheels, a logistics company that serves major clients such as FedEx and Amazon. This order, valued at approximately $1.4 million, includes 20 all-electric Class 3 trucks and marks a significant milestone in the adoption of electric vehicles in the commercial sector.</p><p>The decision by Cashflow on Wheels to transition to electric vehicles was driven by the potential for substantial cost savings, with testing revealing over $500 in savings per route per week. This move not only highlights the economic advantages of electric vehicles but also aligns with broader environmental goals to reduce carbon emissions in the logistics industry.</p><p>This development comes as Mullen Automotive is ramping up its commercial electric vehicle production. The company began commercial vehicle production at its Tunica, Mississippi facility in August 2023 and received IRS approval for federal EV tax credits on its commercial vehicles the following month. These advancements, coupled with the CARB and EPA certifications for the Mullen ONE cargo van and Mullen THREE truck, position Mullen Automotive as a key player in the U.S. electric vehicle market.</p><p>Furthermore, the Mullen THREE truck has been granted additional CARB-issued HVIP approval, offering up to a $45,000 cash voucher at the time of purchase, making it an even more attractive option for businesses looking to electrify their fleets. Mullen Automotive's expansion of its commercial dealer network to seven dealers across the U.S. ensures widespread sales and service coverage, facilitating easier access to its electric vehicles for businesses nationwide.</p><p>The company's recent Foreign Trade Zone status approval for its Tunica manufacturing center further enhances its competitive edge by allowing deferment and potential elimination of duties on exported vehicles. This strategic advantage, combined with the growing demand for electric commercial vehicles, underscores the importance of Mullen Automotive's latest order and its implications for the future of sustainable logistics and transportation.</p></p>
