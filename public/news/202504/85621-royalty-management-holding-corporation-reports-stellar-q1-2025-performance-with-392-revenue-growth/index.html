          <p class='mb-4'><p>Royalty Management Holding Corporation (Nasdaq: RMCO) has announced an extraordinary financial performance for the first quarter of 2025, with total revenues soaring to approximately $973,000. This figure represents a 392% increase compared to the first quarter of 2024, underscoring the company's rapid growth and strategic execution. The revenue surge is attributed to expanded portfolio investments and heightened returns, particularly from its wholly owned subsidiary, RMC Environmental Services LLC, which has played a pivotal role in this achievement.</p><p>The company's performance this quarter not only marks a significant milestone but also surpasses its total revenues for the entire previous year, which stood at $964,703. CEO Thomas Sauve emphasized the strategic investments in diverse resource sectors, including rare earth element deposits, as a cornerstone of the company's growth strategy. The robust revenue expansion has led the board to announce the initiation of a quarterly cash dividend of $0.025 per share, with the first payment set for shareholders of record on June 30, 2025.</p><p>Royalty Management Holding Corporation's business model is centered on acquiring and developing high-value assets across various market environments, with a keen focus on monetizing existing cash flow streams. The success of RMC Environmental Services LLC, especially through securing new contracting business, has been instrumental in enhancing the company's revenue potential. Despite acknowledging current market volatility, Sauve expressed confidence in the company's ability to cautiously evaluate and capitalize on emerging growth opportunities.</p><p>The remarkable year-over-year revenue increase highlights Royalty Management's adaptability and expansion capabilities in challenging economic landscapes. Looking ahead, the company expects continued quarterly growth throughout 2025, with potential increases in dividend payments as the business evolves and further creates shareholder value. This development is a testament to the company's strategic foresight and operational excellence, offering valuable insights for investors and industry observers alike.</p></p>
