          <p class='mb-4'><p>The 2025 Technology and National Security Conference, hosted by Harvard Business School, is set to feature Anthony Marchese, chairman of Texas Mineral Resources Corp., on a panel titled 'Energy & Critical Minerals, Domestic Production in Great Power Competition'. Scheduled for April 5, 2025, this panel will delve into the strategies for fulfilling U.S. energy and mineral needs amidst rising global tensions. Marchese's participation underscores the growing importance of domestic mineral production, particularly in the context of national security and technological progress.</p><p>Marchese is expected to share valuable insights into the production of rare earth elements and technology metals, drawing from Texas Mineral Resources' experience with the Round Top project in Hudspeth County, Texas. The project, in which the company holds a 19.3% interest, focuses on extracting heavy rare earth elements, technology metals, and industrial minerals. This initiative represents a significant step toward reducing reliance on foreign mineral supplies, which is increasingly seen as a vulnerability in the face of complex and geopolitically sensitive global supply chains.</p><p>The conference provides a platform for Marchese to highlight the strategic importance of projects like Round Top in ensuring U.S. technological and economic independence. As global competition for critical minerals intensifies, the discussion at Harvard Business School could not be more timely. The insights shared by Marchese and fellow panelists will likely influence policy and investment decisions in the energy and mineral sectors, making this event a pivotal moment for industry leaders and policymakers alike.</p><p>This presentation is a testament to the critical role that domestic mineral production plays in securing the nation's future. By focusing on the development of local resources, the U.S. can safeguard its technological advancements and economic stability against the backdrop of an unpredictable global landscape. The implications of this discussion extend far beyond the conference room, offering a blueprint for achieving self-sufficiency in mineral production and reinforcing the link between natural resources and national security.</p></p>
