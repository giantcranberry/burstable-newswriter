          <p class='mb-4'><p>Comcast has announced a significant investment in the small business community of King County, with over $3 million allocated through its RISE program. This initiative is designed to provide 100 local entrepreneurs with comprehensive grant packages aimed at enhancing their operational capabilities and resilience. The program's launch comes at a critical time, as recent data from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce highlights inflation as the top concern for 58% of small business owners, with more than one-third facing revenue challenges at rates not seen since 2021.</p><p>The Comcast RISE program offers a multifaceted support package to selected businesses, including a $5,000 monetary grant, a technology makeover, creative production services, media scheduling, educational resources, and business consultation services. This initiative aligns with Mayor Bruce Harrell's economic development strategy, emphasizing the importance of supporting small businesses as pillars of the local economy.</p><p>Eligibility for the program is open to small businesses in King County, with applications accepted from May 1-31 through the program's website. The announcement of winners is scheduled for August, with community partner organizations such as the Bellevue Chamber, Greater Seattle Business Association, and Seattle Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce providing free information sessions to assist potential applicants.</p><p>King County is among five regions selected by Comcast for this round of the RISE program, alongside Boston, Grand Rapids, Nashville, and South Valley. Since its inception in late 2020, the RISE program has supported 14,000 entrepreneurs across the nation, showcasing Comcast's commitment to fostering small business sustainability and growth.</p><p>This initiative is part of Comcast's larger Project UP, which seeks to create digital opportunities and support business growth. By offering targeted resources, Comcast aims to help small businesses not only stabilize in the face of current economic challenges but also innovate and contribute to the resilience of local economies. The Comcast RISE program represents a vital lifeline for small businesses in King County, offering them the tools and support needed to navigate uncertain economic waters and emerge stronger.</p></p>
