          <p class='mb-4'><p>The collaboration between B2i Digital, Inc. and Maxim Group for the Critical Minerals Summit marks a pivotal moment in highlighting the importance of U.S.-based critical minerals projects. Scheduled for May 6, 2025, this virtual event aims to shed light on the concerted efforts by both the industry and government to fast-track the mining and processing of essential minerals within the country. With sectors such as aerospace, defense, and energy relying heavily on these resources, the summit is poised to play a crucial role in fostering discussions around national policy and private sector innovation.</p><p>Under the guidance of Maxim Group Senior Research Analyst Tate Sullivan, the summit will feature presentations and panel discussions that delve into the challenges and opportunities within the critical minerals landscape. B2i Digital's role as the marketing partner involves creating detailed digital profiles for participating companies, thereby providing investors with a deeper understanding of each organization's operations and strategic directions. This initiative is expected to bridge the gap between investors and emerging opportunities, enhancing the visibility of domestic mineral resources in advanced manufacturing and technological development.</p><p>David Shapiro, CEO of B2i Digital, underscores the summit's relevance by pointing to its alignment with national interests and the potential for private sector contributions to meet these critical needs. The event's accessibility to registered M-Vest members, free of charge, further democratizes information and participation in this vital sector. As companies present their projects and strategies, the summit offers a unique platform for attracting investment and elevating the discourse on the indispensable role of critical minerals in sustaining and advancing key industries.</p><p>The involvement of B2i Digital in the Critical Minerals Summit underscores the increasing reliance on digital platforms to connect stakeholders in the technology and industrial sectors. By facilitating a comprehensive overview of the U.S. critical minerals landscape, the summit not only aims to inform but also to inspire actionable insights that could shape the future of domestic resource utilization and technological innovation.</p></p>
