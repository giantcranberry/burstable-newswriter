This transition from conventional financial models to AI-enhanced decision-making processes is expected to boost analysis accuracy, cut down operational expenses, and improve service quality. The firm initiated this technological overhaul in 2024, prioritizing AI integration to achieve these objectives. Early results have shown notable improvements in client portfolio performance and operational efficiency, signaling the promising potential of this approach.</p><p>Since its inception in 2007, Rothsay Consulting has been at the forefront of providing exceptional wealth management services, including financial planning, investment portfolios, and tax consulting.
