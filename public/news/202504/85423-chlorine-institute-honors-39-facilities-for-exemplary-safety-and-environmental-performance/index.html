          <p class='mb-4'><p>The Chlorine Institute (CI) has recently awarded 39 facilities across North America and internationally with its highest honor, the Diamond Level recognition, for their outstanding safety and environmental performance in the chlor-alkali industry. These facilities, which include producers, packagers, manufacturers, and industrial users, have achieved zero recordable injuries, zero reportable quantity incidents, and zero Risk Management Plan reportable accidents over a five-year period, setting a benchmark for the industry.</p><p>Frank Reiner, President of the Chlorine Institute, highlighted the importance of this achievement, noting that it reflects the industry's dedication to the 'Aim for Zero' philosophy, which prioritizes the protection of people, communities, and the environment. Among the recognized facilities are leading chemical companies such as Dow Chemical Company, Covestro LLC, and Westlake Corporation, showcasing a broad commitment to excellence in safety and environmental stewardship.</p><p>Chlorine is a vital chemical with applications that extend far beyond water disinfection, including the production of plastics like PVC, the manufacturing of pharmaceuticals and medical devices, and processes in metal refining and extraction. The Diamond Level recognition not only celebrates the achievements of these facilities but also emphasizes the industry's role in maintaining high safety and environmental standards while supplying essential chemical products.</p><p>The evaluation for this prestigious recognition was based on the facilities' 2024 safety and environmental data, with the Diamond Level representing the pinnacle of achievement in CI's recognition program. By spotlighting these top performers, the Chlorine Institute aims to foster a culture of continuous improvement and safety across the chlor-alkali industry.</p><p>Recipients of the Diamond Level recognition come from various sectors, including chlor-alkali producers in North America and internationally, chlorine packagers, sodium hypochlorite manufacturers, and chlorine industrial users. Notable honorees such as Bayer Crop Science, Kemira Water Solutions, and Industria Química del Istmo illustrate the widespread dedication to safety and environmental responsibility across different industries.</p><p>This accolade highlights the chlor-alkali industry's proactive stance on safety, utilizing extensive resources like training, guidance materials, and best practices to ensure safe operations. The Chlorine Institute's efforts to promote sustainable and secure production, distribution, and use of critical chemicals are instrumental in advancing industry standards and ensuring the well-being of communities and the environment.</p></p>
