          <p class='mb-4'><p>Bizarre Coffee, an independent coffee shop known for its unique approach to coffee and community engagement, is expanding its footprint in metro Atlanta with a new location in Roswell, Georgia. Scheduled to open in fall 2025, the 3,500-square-foot venue at 1090 Alpharetta Street will be the brand's largest to date, offering an enhanced dining experience that includes specialty cocktails alongside its renowned coffee menu.</p><p>Founded by Sabrina Kaylor in 2020, Bizarre Coffee started as a farmer's market favorite and has grown into a staple in the Canton and Woodstock communities. The Roswell expansion signifies not just growth in square footage but also in the brand's ability to create spaces that foster creativity and connection. Kaylor's vision of a 'true third place'—a concept that goes beyond home and work to offer a community hub—is at the heart of this expansion.</p><p>The new location will feature Bizarre Coffee's signature roasts, such as the Freakish Dark Roast and Ethiopian Light Roast, alongside a menu that includes smoothies, bowls, and unique specialty drinks like the Wanderlust Latte. The addition of specialty cocktails represents an innovative twist on the traditional coffee shop model, catering to a broader audience and enhancing the dining experience.</p><p>Stephany Cruz of Ackerman Retail, who facilitated the lease, pointed out the strategic advantage of the Roswell location. Its proximity to the historic district and the charm of the turn-of-the-century building, complete with outdoor patios, align with Bizarre Coffee's aesthetic and community-focused ethos.</p><p>This expansion is a testament to the growing demand for local, community-oriented coffee shops that offer more than just caffeine. Bizarre Coffee's success story reflects a broader trend in the coffee industry towards establishments that prioritize unique experiences, quality products, and a strong sense of community. For business leaders and entrepreneurs, Bizarre Coffee's growth offers insights into the potential of niche markets and the importance of brand identity in standing out in a competitive industry.</p></p>
