          <p class='mb-4'><p>Visionstate Corp. is at the cutting edge of transforming facility management through the integration of artificial intelligence and innovative technology solutions. The company's upcoming standalone inspections application, set for release in early Q3, is designed to seamlessly integrate with its WANDA platform, offering users unparalleled reporting and analytics capabilities. This development signifies a leap forward in operational workflow optimization, providing businesses with the tools needed for smarter facility management.</p><p>In a strategic partnership with the Alberta Machine Intelligence Institute (Amii), Visionstate is also developing an advanced AI model aimed at optimizing cleaning schedules and routing. This initiative addresses the intricate challenges of facility operations by applying intelligent design principles. Slated for completion in Q4 2025, this AI model is expected to open new revenue streams for the company while setting a new standard in the efficiency of facility maintenance operations.</p><p>Visionstate's proactive approach to compliance with regulatory requirements further underscores its leadership in the sector. The company has already updated its WANDA software to align with Ontario's O. Reg. 480/24 under the Occupational Health and Safety Act, which mandates specific washroom cleaning documentation starting January 1, 2026. This move not only demonstrates Visionstate's commitment to regulatory compliance but also positions it as a valuable partner for businesses navigating the complexities of facility management laws.</p><p>Shannon Moore, President of Visionstate, highlights the transformative impact of these technological advancements. By leveraging AI, Visionstate is simplifying complex facility management tasks, turning them into optimized, efficient processes. This focus on innovation is driving the company's mission to enhance operational efficiencies across critical sectors such as healthcare, transportation, and retail, marking a significant step forward in the evolution of smart facility management technology.</p></p>
