          <p class='mb-4'><p>The Georgia Latino Film Alliance (GALFA) is set to host a pivotal legislative roundtable at the Georgia State Capitol, aiming to address the pressing challenges faced by multicultural film production and representation. This event, titled GALFA Reel Talk: Legislative Roundtable, will gather a distinguished panel of speakers, including Dr. Robyn Watson, President of Women in Film & Television Atlanta, and actor French Stewart, the recipient of the GALFA Community Advocate Award. The discussion will center on the crucial need for financial backing and executive support to bring Latino and multicultural stories to the forefront of the film industry.</p><p>Among the featured speakers are Chiquita Woolfolk Banks, a renowned film and TV financial advisor and tax attorney, and Elisabeth Strickler, a professor of media innovation, who will shed light on the transformative role of artificial intelligence in film production. Dr. José Marquez, GALFA's CEO, highlights the roundtable's significance, pointing out that legislative support and financial investment are key to unlocking opportunities for diverse storytelling. The event promises to delve into actionable strategies to foster more inclusive representation within Georgia's burgeoning film industry.</p><p>Hosted by State Representatives Angela Moore and Long Tran, alongside Gabriel Sanchez, Secretary of the Georgia Hispanic Caucus, the roundtable is expected to attract 60-70 participants. This diverse audience will include members of state film committees, investors, studio executives, and filmmakers, all united in their commitment to advancing diversity in film. With sponsorship from leading companies such as VensureHR and American Family Insurance, the event marks a significant milestone in the effort to support emerging multicultural filmmakers in Georgia and beyond.</p><p>This legislative roundtable is not just a meeting of minds but a beacon of hope for the future of multicultural film production. By addressing the systemic barriers to diversity and inclusion in the film industry, GALFA is paving the way for a more equitable and representative cinematic landscape. The implications of this event extend far beyond Georgia, offering a model for how legislative and financial support can catalyze change in the global film industry.</p></p>
