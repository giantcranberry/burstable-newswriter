          <p class='mb-4'><p>Blue Lagoon Resources has taken a significant step forward in its strategic development by welcoming Peter Bojtos, a Professional Engineer with over five decades of international mining experience, to its Mining Committee. This move is part of the company's broader strategy to shift from exploration to production at its Dome Mountain Gold Project in British Columbia, a venture that promises to position Blue Lagoon as a key player in the gold and silver mining sector.</p><p>Bojtos' extensive background includes operational roles in nearly 80 countries and leadership positions that have contributed to 15 major corporate acquisitions, mergers, and sales. His expertise spans a variety of mining operations, from open-pit iron-ore to underground base-metal and uranium mines, making him an invaluable asset to Blue Lagoon as it navigates the complexities of transitioning to production.</p><p>The Dome Mountain Gold Project, with its 15 known high-grade gold veins and vast unexplored potential, stands as a cornerstone of Blue Lagoon's ambitions. The company has already secured one of the few full mining permits issued in British Columbia since 2015, setting the stage for targeted gold production by the third quarter of 2025. However, the path to production is fraught with challenges, including the need for a comprehensive feasibility study to mitigate risks.</p><p>Rana Vig, President and CEO of Blue Lagoon Resources, highlighted the importance of Bojtos' appointment, emphasizing the need for a team of seasoned professionals to guide the company through this critical phase. The Mining Committee, now bolstered by Bojtos' expertise, is tasked with providing technical guidance, operational oversight, and strategic planning to ensure the project's success.</p><p>This development is not just a milestone for Blue Lagoon but also signals a positive shift in the mining industry's capacity to leverage global expertise for sustainable and efficient resource extraction. For stakeholders and observers alike, Bojtos' appointment underscores the company's commitment to responsible mining practices and strategic growth, potentially setting a benchmark for how mining projects can be advanced with expert oversight and careful planning.</p></p>
