          <p class='mb-4'><p>The Copper Property CTL Pass Through Trust has scheduled a pivotal conference call for Tuesday, March 11, 2025, at 12:00 pm Eastern Time, aimed at dissecting its recent financial and operational achievements. This event is set to provide an in-depth analysis of the trust's monthly report for February 2025 and its annual Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024, offering stakeholders a transparent view into its performance and strategic direction.</p><p>With the trust's management team at the helm, the conference will not only cover the financials but also include a detailed Q&A session, allowing participants to probe deeper into the trust's operations and future plans. Accessibility is a key feature of this event, with options for U.S., Canadian, and international investors to dial in, alongside a webcast available through the Trust's Investor Relations Section.</p><p>Emerging from J.C. Penney's Chapter 11 reorganization, the trust holds a significant portfolio of 160 retail properties and 6 warehouse distribution centers. Managed by an affiliate of Hilco Real Estate LLC, its mission is to liquidate these assets efficiently, a strategy that has implications for investors and the commercial real estate market at large. The upcoming conference call is a critical touchpoint for understanding the trust's progress towards these goals, its financial health, and any potential transactions on the horizon.</p><p>For those unable to attend live, the trust ensures inclusivity by offering a replay of the conference call for 30 days post-event. This initiative underscores the trust's commitment to transparency and stakeholder engagement, providing all interested parties with the opportunity to stay informed about its financial and operational trajectory.</p><p>This conference call is more than a routine update; it's a lens through which investors and analysts can gauge the trust's current standing and future prospects. In a landscape where real estate investment trusts (REITs) and liquidating trusts play a pivotal role in the commercial real estate sector, the insights from this call could signal broader trends and opportunities within the industry.</p></p>
