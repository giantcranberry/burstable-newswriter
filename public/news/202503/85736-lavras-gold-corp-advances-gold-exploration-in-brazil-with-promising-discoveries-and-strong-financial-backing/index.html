          <p class='mb-4'><p>Lavras Gold Corp. (TSX-V: LGC) has recently announced substantial advancements in its exploration and development activities within Brazil's gold-rich territories. With a robust cash balance of C$1.65 million at the end of 2024 and a successful equity financing round raising C$15.0 million, the company is strategically positioned to further its mineral resource expansion. This financial stability enables Lavras Gold to aggressively pursue its exploration targets, particularly at the Fazenda do Posto, Butiá, and Caneleira sites, where it plans to conduct approximately 17,000 meters of drilling in 2025.</p><p>The Fazenda do Posto discovery stands out as a significant achievement for Lavras Gold, with drilling results revealing substantial gold mineralization. Highlights include a 340-meter intercept grading 1.1 g/t gold and a high-grade core of 59 meters at 2.9 g/t gold at depth. These findings not only underscore the potential of Fazenda do Posto but also reinforce Lavras Gold's reputation for identifying and developing high-quality gold deposits.</p><p>At the Butiá Deposit, Lavras Gold's most advanced project, the company has reported measured and indicated resources of approximately 377,000 ounces of gold. Recent drilling has confirmed the continuity of mineralization, with notable intercepts such as 236 meters grading 1.4 g/t gold. The Cerrito Deposit complements Butiá's potential, with indicated resources of 188,000 ounces and inferred resources of 293,000 ounces, offering additional avenues for resource expansion.</p><p>Under the leadership of CEO Michael Durose and Chairman Rolly Uloth, Lavras Gold is navigating a strategic path from exploration to production. The company is currently advancing economic and metallurgical studies at Fazenda do Posto and Butiá towards a preliminary economic assessment, a critical step in evaluating the viability of these projects. With the gold market showing favorable conditions, Lavras Gold's disciplined approach to exploration and financial management positions it as a compelling player in the gold mining industry, attracting potential joint venture partnerships and capital investments.</p><p>The implications of Lavras Gold's progress extend beyond the company itself, offering insights into the potential for new gold discoveries in Brazil and the importance of disciplined financial and exploration strategies in the mining sector. For investors and industry leaders, Lavras Gold's achievements highlight the opportunities and challenges inherent in gold exploration and development, underscoring the value of experienced leadership and strategic planning in unlocking mineral wealth.</p></p>
