          <p class='mb-4'><p>Wire Industries, under its FantasyWire brand, has unveiled a transformative secondary marketplace for daily fantasy sports (DFS) entries, setting a new standard in the industry. This platform, developed in collaboration with RealTime Fantasy Sports, allows users to trade Pickem and Pool entries, leveraging a real-time trading environment powered by an advanced pricing engine. This innovation not only enhances user engagement but also introduces a novel layer of strategy to DFS.</p><p>The platform's core feature is its ability to calculate entry probabilities and dynamic market values through thousands of real-time simulations. This technological marvel has already garnered recognition, with WagerWire receiving two awards from the Fantasy Sports and Gaming Association (FSGA) for 'Best Product Experience' and 'Best Innovation'. These accolades underscore the platform's potential to redefine the fantasy sports landscape by creating liquidity for gaming assets and offering users deep insights into entry values.</p><p>Tim Jensen, COO of RT Sports, emphasized the uniqueness of the platform, noting its capability to convert entries into tradable assets based on real-time value. The dynamic pricing models, which update continuously during games, equip participants with sophisticated tools to optimize their returns. This feature represents a significant departure from traditional DFS platforms, offering a more interactive and strategic experience.</p><p>The launch of the DFS Pool marketplace follows the successful introduction of the Pickem entries marketplace, highlighting WagerWire's dedication to innovating the fantasy sports experience. By facilitating the buying and selling of entries with advanced pricing mechanisms, the platform not only enhances user engagement but also opens up new avenues for strategy and competition.</p><p>Supporting the platform's expansion, Wire Media is focusing on storytelling and user experiences to foster organic engagement, moving away from conventional advertising methods. This approach aligns with the broader industry trend towards creating more immersive and interactive user experiences.</p><p>The timing of the launch coincides with the election of WagerWire's CEO Zach Doctor to the FSGA Board of Directors, further cementing the company's reputation as a pioneer in fantasy sports technology. This development signals a bright future for Wire Industries and its FantasyWire platform, as it continues to push the boundaries of what's possible in the DFS domain.</p></p>
