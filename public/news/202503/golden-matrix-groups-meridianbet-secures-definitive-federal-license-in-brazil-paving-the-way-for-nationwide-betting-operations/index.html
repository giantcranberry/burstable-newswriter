          <p class='mb-4'><p>Meridianbet, under the umbrella of Golden Matrix Group, has achieved a pivotal milestone by securing a definitive federal license from Brazil's Ministry of Finance. This license, numbered 0086/2024, authorizes the company to conduct nationwide online and retail fixed-odds betting operations until December 31, 2029. This development is a testament to Meridianbet's strategic expansion into Brazil's burgeoning gaming sector, which is projected by H2 Gambling Capital to reach a valuation of US$10 billion by 2029.</p><p>The comprehensive license distinguishes Meridianbet as one of the select few operators with the capability to offer both online and physical betting services in Brazil. Brian Goodman, CEO of Golden Matrix Group, underscored the license's strategic value, highlighting its role in unlocking significant revenue opportunities within a high-potential market. This achievement builds on an initial online betting license granted in January 2025, further solidifying the company's commitment to global market expansion.</p><p>Zoran Milosevic, CEO of Meridianbet, celebrated the license as a historic achievement that enables the company to introduce its advanced gaming technology to millions of Brazilian players. The license not only ensures long-term operational stability but also positions Meridianbet to capitalize on its proprietary technology and deep market expertise. Issued under SPA/MF Ordinance No. 526 and published in the Official Gazette of the Union, the license serves as a formal endorsement of Meridianbet's operational capabilities in Brazil.</p><p>This strategic advancement aligns with Golden Matrix Group's overarching goals of penetrating regulated, high-growth gaming markets while adhering to strict compliance standards and promoting responsible gaming practices. The acquisition of this license is a clear indicator of the company's robust growth trajectory and its ability to navigate complex regulatory environments, setting a precedent for future expansions in other lucrative markets worldwide.</p></p>
