          <p class='mb-4'><p>The technological landscape is witnessing a significant evolution as Taiwan and European nations deepen their partnerships in semiconductors and high-performance computing (HPC). This collaboration, rooted in complementary strengths and a shared vision for innovation, was prominently showcased at the Semi Impact Forum 2024 in Barcelona, Spain. A delegation from Taiwan's National Applied Research Laboratories (NARLabs) participated, highlighting the growing international cooperation in technology sectors.</p><p>Professor Konrad Young, former Director of Research and Development at TSMC, pointed out the strategic potential of this partnership. According to Young, Taiwan's prowess in semiconductor manufacturing and design dovetails with Europe's strong capabilities in equipment and fundamental research. This synergy is not just beneficial but essential for pushing the boundaries of what's possible in technology today.</p><p>Adding to the discourse, Professor Rui Carlos Oliveira from Portugal's INESC TEC Institute emphasized the natural alignment between Taiwan's semiconductor leadership and Europe's advancements in AI and HPC. What began as a collaboration in high-performance computing and marine technology in 2017 has now expanded into the realm of artificial intelligence, showcasing the dynamic nature of this partnership.</p><p>Both Young and Oliveira highlighted the indispensable role of interdisciplinary education and the collaboration between academia and industry in sustaining technological competitiveness. They advocate for a global perspective on technological advancement, one that prioritizes cooperation and the sharing of knowledge over national rivalries.</p><p>This partnership is a testament to the power of collaborative innovation, positioning Taiwan and Europe as leaders in the semiconductor and artificial intelligence fields. By combining their unique technological strengths, they are not only accelerating the pace of innovation but also paving the way for future scientific and industrial breakthroughs that could have far-reaching implications for the global tech industry.</p></p>
