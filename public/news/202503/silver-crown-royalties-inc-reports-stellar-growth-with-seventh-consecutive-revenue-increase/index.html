          <p class='mb-4'><p>Silver Crown Royalties Inc. (SCRi) has once again proven its financial resilience and strategic acumen by reporting its seventh consecutive quarter of revenue growth. The fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 saw the company achieving a revenue of $234,702, a figure that not only represents a 43% increase from the previous quarter but also a staggering 343% rise compared to the same period last year. This performance is based on minimum aggregate quarterly payments of 5,500 silver ounces, underscoring the company's robust position in the silver royalties market.</p><p>The annual financial results further illuminate SCRi's impressive trajectory, with full-year 2024 revenue soaring to $581,337 from $124,772 in 2023, marking a 366% increase. Such growth is a testament to the company's strategic approach to silver royalty investments and the efficacy of its business model. CEO Peter Bures attributed this success to the team's unwavering commitment to achieving strategic objectives and the company's ability to maintain a portfolio of four silver royalties, three of which are currently generating revenue.</p><p>SCRi's business model is designed to offer investors a unique exposure to precious metals, serving as a natural hedge against currency devaluation and mitigating the economic impact of production cost inflation. By focusing on maximizing shareholder returns while supporting mining projects, SCRi has positioned itself as a noteworthy player in the precious metals sector.</p><p>Looking ahead, SCRi is optimistic about sustaining its growth momentum. The company anticipates another record silver payment and revenue quarter in the first quarter of 2025, fueled by the early payment of the PPX/Igor 4 royalty. This forward-looking statement not only reflects SCRi's confidence in its business model but also signals potential opportunities for investors and the broader precious metals market.</p><p>The implications of SCRi's financial performance and strategic direction are significant. For investors, the company's success story offers a compelling case for the value of silver royalty investments as part of a diversified portfolio. For the industry, SCRi's growth underscores the potential of innovative business models in the precious metals sector to drive revenue and shareholder value. On a global scale, the company's achievements highlight the enduring appeal of precious metals as a hedge against economic uncertainty, reinforcing the importance of strategic investments in this space.</p></p>
