This move not only aligns with global efforts to reduce carbon emissions but also positions Surf Air Mobility as a leader in the adoption of green technologies in aviation.</p><p>Financially, Surf Air Mobility is bolstering its position with a $50.0 million term loan and an extension of debt maturity, ensuring the necessary resources for maintenance backlog and operational enhancements. Stonegate Capital Partners' valuation of the company, using an EV/Revenue framework, projects a promising future with a valuation range between $6.68 and $11.19.</p><p>Transitioning from transformation to optimization, Surf Air Mobility is now focused on refining its operations to improve profitability.
