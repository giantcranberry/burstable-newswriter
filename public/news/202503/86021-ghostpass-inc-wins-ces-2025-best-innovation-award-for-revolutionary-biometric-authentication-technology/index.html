          <p class='mb-4'><p>GhostPass Inc. has been honored with the CES 2025 Best Innovation Award in the Fintech category for its pioneering decentralized and dualized biometric authentication (DDBA) technology. This accolade not only celebrates the company's innovative approach to digital security but also marks a significant milestone in the evolution of authentication technologies. By addressing the vulnerabilities inherent in centralized biometric data storage, GhostPass offers a transformative solution that enhances security while improving user convenience.</p><p>The core innovation of GhostPass's technology lies in its decentralized storage of facial recognition data on users' personal devices, a method that significantly reduces the risk of large-scale data breaches. Certified by Korea Testing Certification (KTC) and Korea Testing & Certification Authority (KOTCA), the system boasts a 99% authentication accuracy rate within a mere 0.6 seconds. Such performance metrics not only underscore the reliability of GhostPass's solution but also its potential to set new industry standards for speed and accuracy in biometric authentication.</p><p>The implications of this technology extend far beyond individual security, offering substantial benefits to businesses across various sectors. Financial services, enterprise security, and contactless payments are just a few areas where GhostPass's DDBA technology can make a profound impact. By mitigating authentication-related risks and potentially reducing security costs by up to ten times compared to traditional server-based systems, GhostPass presents a compelling value proposition for businesses looking to enhance their security posture without compromising on efficiency or user experience.</p><p>With over 75 global patents and backing from prominent investors such as the Korea Technology Finance Corporation and Oracle Venture Investment, GhostPass is well-positioned to lead the charge in the next wave of digital authentication technologies. The company's demonstration of practical applications at CES 2025, including an automated refrigerator capable of recognizing users and processing payments automatically, offers a glimpse into the future of seamless and secure digital interactions.</p><p>As the digital landscape continues to evolve, the importance of robust authentication technologies cannot be overstated. GhostPass's commitment to integrating emerging technologies like AI-driven authentication, blockchain security, and advanced biometric recognition into its offerings signals a forward-thinking approach to tackling the cybersecurity challenges of tomorrow. The CES 2025 award not only validates GhostPass's innovative contributions to the field but also highlights the critical role of such technologies in shaping a more secure and efficient digital future.</p></p>
