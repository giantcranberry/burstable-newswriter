          <p class='mb-4'><p>The mobile gaming industry is witnessing a significant development as Core Gaming, a prominent mobile game developer and publisher, announces its entry into the public market through a strategic reverse merger with Siyata Mobile Inc. This merger values Core Gaming at an impressive $160 million, highlighting the company's ambitious growth strategy in a sector that is projected to reach $82.4 billion by 2029. With the number of mobile gaming players expected to soar to 2.4 billion worldwide, Core Gaming's timing could not be more impeccable.</p><p>Under the leadership of CEO Aitan Zacharin, Core Gaming has carved out a unique niche in the mobile gaming industry. The company's portfolio includes developing and co-developing over 2,000 games across 140 countries, supported by a robust publishing network that aids other developers in marketing their products. This innovative approach has already garnered Core Gaming 40 million monthly active users and over 600 million downloads, showcasing its significant impact on the mobile gaming landscape.</p><p>What sets Core Gaming apart from its competitors is its advanced utilization of artificial intelligence. The company has developed AI tools that not only enhance content production by 50% but also reduce production time by over 40%. These tools enable Core Gaming to strategically identify and capitalize on underserved niches within the mobile gaming market, further solidifying its position as a leader in innovation.</p><p>The reverse merger with Siyata Mobile is a strategic move that will allow Core Gaming to list on the Nasdaq, thereby increasing its visibility and opening up new opportunities for strategic acquisitions. Unlike industry giants such as AppLovin, Core Gaming offers investors a more accessible entry point into the lucrative mobile gaming market. With approximately $80 million in revenue last year and a clear trajectory for continued growth, Core Gaming is poised to redefine the competitive dynamics of the mobile gaming industry.</p><p>This merger not only marks a pivotal moment for Core Gaming but also signals the growing importance of mobile gaming as a dominant force in the global entertainment industry. The company's leadership is confident that the $160 million valuation is merely the beginning, with the potential for significant market value growth on the horizon. For investors and industry observers alike, Core Gaming's strategic moves offer a compelling glimpse into the future of mobile gaming.</p></p>
