          <p class='mb-4'><p>The Trump administration has put forward a proposal that could radically transform the U.S. federal tax system by eliminating the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and replacing federal income taxes with tariffs on imported goods. This bold move aims to shift the primary source of government revenue from income tax collection to international trade tariffs, a strategy that could have profound implications for taxpayers across the nation.</p><p>For individuals and businesses with existing tax liens and outstanding tax obligations, the proposed changes introduce a layer of uncertainty. The dismantling of the IRS could disrupt current tax enforcement mechanisms, including wage garnishments and tax lien resolutions, leaving many to wonder how their existing debts will be managed under the new system.</p><p>Washington, D.C., with its dense population of federal employees and government contractors, is particularly vulnerable to the ripple effects of this policy shift. The area's economy, heavily reliant on federal governance, could face unique challenges as the proposed External Revenue Service takes shape.</p><p>Tax professionals are urging those with existing tax liabilities to take proactive steps to understand and prepare for the potential changes. The transition from an income-based tax system to one financed through tariffs could complicate current tax settlement processes, making it essential for taxpayers to stay informed and seek expert advice.</p><p>Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick's comments have further highlighted the significance of this proposal, which represents a dramatic departure from traditional revenue generation methods. While the plan offers the promise of relief from federal income taxes, it also poses significant questions about the future of tax enforcement and the resolution of existing tax debts.</p><p>As the proposal moves through the legislative process, its potential to reshape the U.S. tax landscape cannot be understated. Taxpayers, especially those with unresolved tax issues, are advised to closely monitor developments and consider the implications for their financial and legal standing.</p></p>
