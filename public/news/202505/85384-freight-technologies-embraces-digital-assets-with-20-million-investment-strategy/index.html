          <p class='mb-4'><p>Freight Technologies (Nasdaq: FRGT) has taken a bold step into the digital asset space by entering into a convertible note agreement that could total up to $20 million. This strategic move begins with an initial $1 million tranche allocated to purchasing Official Trump Tokens ($TRUMP), following closely on the heels of an $8 million investment in FET tokens. This initiative underscores the company's commitment to diversifying its investment portfolio through digital assets, aligning with its mission to revolutionize U.S.–Mexico commerce with cutting-edge technology.</p><p>Under the leadership of CEO Javier Selgas, Fr8Tech is not just a logistics company but a technology-driven enterprise that leverages artificial intelligence and machine learning to optimize supply chain processes. Its suite of solutions, including the Fr8App platform for cross-border shipping, Fr8Now for less-than-truckload shipping, Fr8Fleet for enterprise client capacity services, and Waavely for ocean freight management, positions it as a leader in logistics innovation. The foray into digital assets represents a novel approach to treasury management, potentially unlocking new value for stakeholders by marrying the worlds of logistics and cryptocurrency.</p><p>This investment is indicative of a broader trend where traditional logistics and technology companies are exploring digital assets as part of their financial strategies. By integrating cryptocurrency investments with its core services, Fr8Tech is not only diversifying its portfolio but also signaling confidence in the potential of digital assets to complement and enhance traditional business models. This move could inspire other companies in the logistics and technology sectors to consider how digital assets might fit into their own strategic planning, marking a significant moment in the convergence of these industries.</p><p>The implications of Fr8Tech's digital asset strategy extend beyond the company itself, offering a glimpse into the future of corporate treasury management and investment. As businesses increasingly look to digital assets as a means of diversification and value creation, the lines between traditional and digital finance continue to blur. For leaders in business and technology, Fr8Tech's approach provides a compelling case study in innovation, risk management, and the strategic use of emerging technologies to drive growth and competitive advantage.</p></p>
