          <p class='mb-4'><p>Simulated Environment Concepts, Inc. (SMEV) has taken a significant step towards revolutionizing sustainable agriculture and seafood production by appointing Noah Wagler, a pioneering Amish farmer from Hamilton, Indiana, as a new company officer. Wagler's appointment is poised to accelerate the company's growth and innovation in these critical sectors, leveraging his extensive experience in sustainable technologies that have shown remarkable results in enhancing crop and livestock yields.</p><p>Wagler's innovative approach includes structured water testing, a method that has demonstrated promising outcomes in increasing agricultural productivity across various regions. His experiments span a wide range of applications, from cattle in Japan to poultry and sweet corn in the United States, and rice fields in Mississippi, Arkansas, and several Asian countries. This diverse experience underscores the potential of his technologies to address global food production challenges sustainably.</p><p>Currently, Wagler is spearheading the development of an environmental campus in Indiana focused on agriculture, seafood, poultry, and beef production. This initiative has already received backing from a local university and the Amish community, highlighting the broad support for sustainable agricultural practices. Furthermore, his involvement in a European fund related to the EIS UK program, aimed at raising approximately $17.5 million, signifies a strategic effort to finance SMEV's projects with minimal impact on shareholder value.</p><p>The collaboration between Wagler's Indiana farms and SMEV's North Carolina facility is expected to foster extraordinary organic growth. His team-oriented culture, rooted in the hard work and dedication characteristic of his Amish background, is set to play a pivotal role in achieving these goals. SMEV's leadership regards Wagler's appointment as a transformative move that will not only advance the company's mission but also set new standards in sustainable food production and distribution.</p><p>The interest from potential clients in Wagler's technologies underscores the growing demand for sustainable agricultural solutions. This development marks a promising future for SMEV, as it positions itself at the forefront of innovation in sustainable agriculture and seafood production, addressing some of the most pressing environmental and food security challenges of our time.</p></p>
