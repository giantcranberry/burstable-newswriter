          <p class='mb-4'><p>West Lane Partners has significantly bolstered its leadership team with the appointment of Rita Sallis as a Senior Advisor. Sallis, whose career spans decades in both public and private sector finance, is expected to play a pivotal role in advancing the firm's strategic goals. Her background includes serving as the Chief Investment Officer of New York City's $100 billion pension system, where she managed investment plans for five public pension boards and led a team of 50 professionals through some of the most challenging financial periods in recent history.</p><p>Deryck Palmer, founder and managing partner of West Lane Partners, praised Sallis for her exceptional ability to navigate complex financial landscapes. Her tenure during the aftermath of 9/11 and the 2008 financial crisis showcased her strategic acumen and operational discipline, qualities that align with the firm's mission. Sallis's expertise is not limited to public finance; her roles at The Yucaipa Companies and as chair of the Infrastructure Investments Fund highlight her versatility and deep understanding of institutional investment and private equity.</p><p>Sallis's induction into the Wall Street Hall of Fame and recognition as one of the "25 Influential Black Women in Business" underscore her contributions to the finance industry. Her addition to West Lane Partners is a testament to the firm's commitment to leveraging top-tier talent to identify and execute special situations across the middle market. This move is expected to have significant implications for the firm's growth and the broader finance industry, as Sallis's strategic judgment and leadership will likely influence future investment strategies and outcomes.</p></p>
