          <p class='mb-4'><p>The collaboration between ARC Clean Technology and Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power (KHNP) signifies a major leap forward in the nuclear energy sector, particularly in the development and deployment of fourth-generation small modular reactors (SMRs). The ARC-100, a 100-megawatt sodium-cooled fast reactor, stands at the center of this partnership, offering a promising solution for carbon-free power generation and industrial heat applications. This development is not just a technological milestone but also a strategic move to secure future growth drivers for the nuclear industry and establish a strong global market presence.</p><p>During a recent meeting in Seoul, the two companies explored further collaboration opportunities, building on a trilateral agreement signed last year that laid the groundwork for joint efforts in commissioning, operations, maintenance, and project management of ARC units. The ARC-100's ongoing development at the Point Lepreau site, in partnership with New Brunswick Power, and the submission of a License to Prepare Site application to the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission in 2023, underscore the tangible progress being made toward the reactor's commercial demonstration.</p><p>Dr. Jooho Whang, CEO of KHNP, and Donald Wolf, CEO of ARC Clean Technology, both emphasized the strategic and complementary nature of their partnership. KHNP brings to the table its vast expertise in nuclear operations and construction, while ARC Clean Technology contributes cutting-edge innovation in nuclear energy. This synergy not only enhances the potential for successful deployment of the ARC-100 but also positions both organizations to explore international opportunities for advanced nuclear technology.</p><p>The implications of this partnership extend far beyond the immediate stakeholders. The ARC-100's modular design and its participation in the U.S. Department of Energy's Advanced Reactor Demonstration Program highlight its potential to revolutionize clean energy production. By advancing sustainable, low-carbon energy technologies, this collaboration could play a critical role in global efforts to combat climate change, offering a scalable and efficient alternative to traditional energy sources. For industry leaders and policymakers, the progress of the ARC-100 and similar technologies represents a pivotal moment in the transition towards a more sustainable and energy-secure future.</p></p>
