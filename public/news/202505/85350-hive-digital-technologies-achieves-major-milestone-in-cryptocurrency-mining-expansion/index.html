          <p class='mb-4'><p>HIVE Digital Technologies has marked a significant achievement in its ambitious 2025 growth strategy by successfully completing the first 100 megawatt infrastructure phase at its Yguazù facility in Paraguay. This development is a cornerstone in the company's expansion, featuring a new air-cooled data center supported by a fully energized 200 MW substation. The facility is designed to accommodate 5 EH/s of next-generation ASIC miners, with HIVE already operating 200 petahashes using its proprietary BUZZ Miners.</p><p>The company's strategic expansion is notable for its debt-free approach, relying instead on disciplined treasury management to fuel growth. By the end of April, HIVE plans to have 8,000 BUZZ Miners operational, scaling up to over 20,000 new-generation ASICs by May, including advanced Bitmain S21+ units. This expansion is part of HIVE's broader goal to achieve a total hashrate of 11.5 EH/s across all operations by the end of the second quarter.</p><p>Leadership at HIVE is optimistic about the company's trajectory. Luke Rossy, Chief Operating Officer, outlined the ambitious target of reaching 25 EH/s by Fall 2025, which could enable the daily production of over 12 Bitcoins at current difficulty levels. Aydin Kilic, President and CEO, emphasized the strategic importance of maintaining a debt-free expansion, highlighting the company's commitment to smart, measured growth.</p><p>To support its expansion efforts, HIVE has strengthened its team with the addition of Carlos Anibal Torres as Paraguay Operations and Project Manager. Torres brings a wealth of experience in large-scale infrastructure and energy systems, further bolstering HIVE's operational capabilities.</p><p>This expansion occurs against a backdrop of favorable market conditions for Bitcoin, with increasing institutional interest and a supportive regulatory environment. HIVE's strategic initiatives position the company to potentially capture 3% of the global Bitcoin network by year-end, a significant achievement in the competitive cryptocurrency mining sector.</p></p>
