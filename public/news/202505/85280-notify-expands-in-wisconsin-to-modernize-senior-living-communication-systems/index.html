          <p class='mb-4'><p>Notify, a technology leader in nurse call and staff communication systems for senior living facilities, is making significant strides in Wisconsin. This expansion is designed to assist healthcare providers in upgrading their communication infrastructure with minimal disruption. Spearheaded by Erich Klett, the new Director of Strategic Partnerships, Notify is set to bring its expertise in healthcare and senior living technology to the forefront. Klett's 16 years of experience in the field underscore the company's commitment to improving care coordination and reducing staff complications through technology.</p><p>At the heart of Notify's offering is its Overlay Platform, a solution that stands out for its ability to integrate alerts and reporting across over 25 nurse call system manufacturers. This platform is notable for its quick installation process, requiring only hours and no major infrastructure changes. Complementing this is the Notify Communications App, which provides secure, WiFi-based push-to-talk voice communication within facilities. This app represents a leap forward from traditional communication methods, such as radios, offering a more efficient and modern alternative.</p><p>Greg Robertson, SVP of Growth at Notify, highlights the importance of solutions that can adapt to the varied needs of different communities and work with existing hardware. This approach is particularly relevant in Wisconsin, where healthcare providers face unique challenges in standardizing their communication systems. To facilitate adoption, Notify is offering free pilot programs for both its Overlay Platform and Communications App. These pilots are designed to allow communities to experience the benefits of Notify's technologies in real-world settings, with full support and no need for infrastructure changes.</p><p>With its solutions already in use in over 600 senior living communities across the country, including several in Wisconsin, Notify's expansion is poised to make a significant impact. The company's focus on enhancing care coordination, increasing operational visibility, and supporting caregiver retention—without the necessity for complete system overhauls—marks a pivotal step forward for senior living facilities striving to meet the demands of modern healthcare.</p></p>
