          <p class='mb-4'><p>Nicola Mining Inc., a junior resource company based in British Columbia, is setting a new standard in the mining industry by operating a fully owned processing facility while exploring high-potential mineral properties. This dual strategy not only positions the company for sustainable growth but also minimizes the risks typically associated with junior mining operations.</p><p>The company's gold and silver mill near Merritt, British Columbia, is a cornerstone of its innovative business model. As the province's only third-party processing facility, it enables Nicola to process high-grade materials from its own and partner projects, generating revenue and reducing equity dilution. This infrastructure is a significant competitive advantage, allowing the company to explore new opportunities while maintaining a steady cash flow.</p><p>Nicola's portfolio includes the New Craigmont Copper Project and the Treasure Mountain Silver Project, both of which are 100% owned by the company. The New Craigmont Copper Project, adjacent to Canada's largest copper mine, is particularly promising and could significantly contribute to the company's resource extraction capabilities.</p><p>Recent developments, such as partnerships with gold producers and the acquisition of a 75% economic stake in Dominion Gold, underscore Nicola's strategic approach to growth. The planned bulk sample commencement in the second half of 2025 further highlights the company's commitment to expanding its operations and revenue streams.</p><p>By integrating direct mineral exploration with processing infrastructure, Nicola Mining Inc. is not only diversifying its revenue sources but also setting a precedent for how junior mining companies can achieve stability and growth in a competitive industry. This approach could have far-reaching implications for the sector, encouraging other companies to explore similar models to mitigate risks and capitalize on opportunities.</p></p>
