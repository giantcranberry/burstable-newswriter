          <p class='mb-4'><p>Civeo Corporation (NYSE: CVEO) unveiled its financial outcomes for the first quarter of 2025, presenting a mixed bag of results that highlighted significant hurdles in Canada alongside robust performance in Australia. The company's consolidated revenue missed the mark at $144.0 million, largely due to pricing pressures and a decrease in billed rooms volume in Canada. This downturn was particularly pronounced in the Canadian segment, where earnings plummeted by 40.0% year-over-year to $40.4 million, attributed to reduced spending in the oil sands region and the loss of Fort Hills-related occupancy.</p><p>In response to these challenges, Civeo has taken decisive steps to mitigate losses, including a 25% reduction in its Canadian workforce and the closure of two lodges. These measures underscore the company's commitment to navigating through the current difficulties with a focus on sustainability and efficiency.</p><p>On a brighter note, the Australian segment emerged as a beacon of growth, with revenue climbing 13% year-over-year to $103.6 million. This success was fueled by heightened activity under a lucrative six-year, A$1.4 billion contract and strategic expansions in the Bowen Basin, showcasing the segment's resilience and potential for further growth.</p><p>Looking ahead, Civeo has adjusted its 2025 financial guidance, now expecting revenue to fall between $620 million and $650 million, with adjusted EBITDA projected at $75 million to $85 million. The company has also revised its capital expenditure guidance downward to $20-$25 million, reflecting a disciplined approach to capital deployment. Additionally, Civeo has enhanced its share repurchase authorization from 10% to 20% of shares outstanding, a move that underscores its confidence in long-term value creation and financial flexibility.</p><p>Despite a $20.9 million increase in net debt quarter-over-quarter, bringing the total to $59.0 million, Civeo remains optimistic about its ability to generate free cash flow, supported by a capital-light business model and a significant portion of recurring asset-light services revenue. This strategic positioning highlights the company's adaptability and resilience in the face of sector-specific challenges and broader market uncertainties.</p></p>
