          <p class='mb-4'><p>The small business lending market is witnessing a pivotal shift as traditional banks scale back their financing roles, creating a burgeoning opportunity for alternative lenders. FAVO Capital Inc. is at the forefront of this transformation, with recent filings indicating its ambition to uplist to the Nasdaq stock exchange. This strategic move underscores the company's commitment to enhancing its market position and accessibility to capital, crucial for fueling its growth in a $1.7 trillion market.</p><p>FAVO Capital's expansion strategy is multifaceted, involving the strengthening of its partnership with Stewards Investment Capital Limited through a Series A equity investment. Additionally, the company has streamlined its capital structure by converting all outstanding Super Voting Series C Preferred Shares into common stock. These steps are indicative of FAVO's readiness to capitalize on the evolving small business lending landscape, where digital platforms and policy shifts are redefining access to financing.</p><p>The decision to uplist to Nasdaq is not merely a procedural milestone but a strategic endeavor to boost FAVO's visibility and credibility among investors and borrowers alike. In an era where small and medium-sized businesses increasingly rely on innovative lending solutions, FAVO's technological scalability and experienced leadership team position it as a key player in addressing the financing gap left by traditional banks.</p><p>This development is significant for industry stakeholders, as it highlights the growing importance of alternative lenders in sustaining small business growth. For FAVO Capital, the Nasdaq uplist represents an opportunity to access broader capital markets, enabling it to further innovate and expand its lending solutions. The implications for the small business sector are profound, offering a glimpse into a future where access to capital is more democratized and driven by technological advancement.</p></p>
