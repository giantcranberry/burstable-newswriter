          <p class='mb-4'><p>Stephanie Vanderbilt, the founder of Coastal Windows & Exteriors, has carved a unique niche in the construction industry by blending her passion for education with her entrepreneurial spirit. Her company stands out as the only woman-owned siding company in the United States to be honored with the James Hardie President's Club Award, a testament to her exceptional leadership and dedication to quality.</p><p>Vanderbilt's journey from teaching deaf students to leading a top-rated remodeling contractor underscores her belief in the power of education and transparency. This philosophy has not only guided her business practices but also empowered homeowners to make informed decisions about their home improvement projects. Coastal Windows & Exteriors, under her guidance, has been recognized as the #1 woman-owned replacement company in New England by Inc. 5000, offering a range of services from energy-efficient windows to siding installations and roofing.</p><p>Beyond her business achievements, Vanderbilt's commitment to community service is evident through initiatives like Roofs for Heroes, which provides support to veterans. Her leadership challenges the gender norms in an industry where women represent only 14% of the workforce, proving that success is not defined by gender but by the quality of service and the impact on the community.</p><p>With over 700 Google 5-star reviews and certifications from industry leaders such as GAF and James Hardie, Coastal Windows & Exteriors has established a reputation for excellence across New England. Vanderbilt's story is not just about breaking barriers but also about setting new standards in the construction industry, inspiring future generations to pursue their passions with determination and integrity.</p></p>
