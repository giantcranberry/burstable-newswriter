          <p class='mb-4'><p>Capstone Holding Corp. (NASDAQ: CAPS) has confidently reaffirmed its financial outlook for 2025, setting a revenue run-rate target of $100 million and an adjusted EBITDA of $10 million. This announcement underscores the company's commitment to a growth strategy that hinges on a disciplined merger and acquisition (M&A) pipeline and stringent cost management practices. By targeting acquisitions at 4–6x EBITDA multiples and structuring deals to include up to 45% non-cash consideration, Capstone is positioning itself for expansion while maintaining financial flexibility.</p><p>The company's strategic initiatives are further bolstered by an equity line of credit, a move designed to facilitate acquisitions without immediate dilution to shareholders. This approach reflects Capstone's focus on balancing growth with shareholder value, a critical consideration for investors in today's competitive market landscape.</p><p>Instone, a key subsidiary of Capstone, remains integral to the company's growth trajectory. With operations spanning 31 U.S. states, Instone specializes in high-demand products such as stone veneer, landscape stone, and modular masonry systems. Despite facing seasonal fluctuations, the subsidiary is on track to meet its cost run-rate projections, with expectations of accelerated growth in the coming quarters.</p><p>Capstone's model of combining organic growth with strategic acquisitions, supported by a shareholder-aligned capital structure, presents a compelling case for long-term value creation. For business and technology leaders, Capstone's strategy offers insights into leveraging M&A and operational efficiency to achieve sustainable growth in challenging markets. The implications of Capstone's approach extend beyond its immediate financial targets, serving as a blueprint for companies aiming to navigate the complexities of expansion while preserving shareholder interests.</p></p>
