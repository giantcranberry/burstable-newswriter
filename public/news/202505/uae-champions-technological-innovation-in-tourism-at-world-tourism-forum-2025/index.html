          <p class='mb-4'><p>The United Arab Emirates, under the leadership of His Excellency Abdulla bin Touq Al Marri, UAE Minister of Economy and Chairman of the Emirates Tourism Council, has taken a significant step towards redefining the future of tourism at the World Tourism Forum 2025 in Prague. The forum, a collaborative effort between UN Tourism and the Czech Republic's government, served as a platform for discussing the integration of artificial intelligence and advanced technologies in the tourism sector, with a strong emphasis on sustainability and innovation.</p><p>H.E. Bin Touq's participation underscored the UAE's strategic focus on tourism as a key economic driver. The country's ambitious National Tourism Strategy 2031 aims to elevate the UAE to the pinnacle of global tourism destinations. This strategy includes ambitious targets such as increasing the sector's GDP contribution to AED 450 billion, attracting AED 100 billion in tourism investments, and hosting 40 million hotel guests, showcasing the UAE's commitment to not only growing its economy but also enhancing its global stature in the tourism industry.</p><p>The discussions at the forum revolved around the transformative potential of AI, smart tourism initiatives, and the importance of sustainability in the sector. These conversations highlighted the UAE's proactive approach in adopting digital solutions and fostering international collaborations to create a tourism ecosystem that is both sustainable and technologically advanced. The emphasis on societal responsibility, education, and environmental considerations further illustrates the comprehensive approach the UAE is taking towards tourism development.</p><p>H.E. Bin Touq's remarks at the forum emphasized the critical role of global partnerships and the development of national talent in securing a prosperous future for the tourism sector. By positioning itself as a leader in innovative and sustainable tourism experiences, the UAE is not only contributing to the global tourism landscape but also setting a benchmark for others to follow. This initiative is a testament to the UAE's vision of harnessing technology and innovation to drive economic growth and sustainability in the tourism sector, making it a pivotal moment for industry leaders and stakeholders worldwide.</p></p>
