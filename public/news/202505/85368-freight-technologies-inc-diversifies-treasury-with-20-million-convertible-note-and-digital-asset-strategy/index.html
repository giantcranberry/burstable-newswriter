          <p class='mb-4'><p>Freight Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ: FRGT), a leader in technology-driven logistics solutions, has announced a significant step towards diversifying its treasury through digital assets. The company has secured a convertible note agreement for up to $20 million from an institutional investor, with an initial allocation towards purchasing Official Trump Tokens ($TRUMP). This move underscores Fr8Tech's commitment to integrating financial technology innovations into its business model, alongside its traditional logistics operations.</p><p>CEO Javier Selgas highlighted the strategic alignment of this investment with the company's mission to enhance U.S.–Mexico commerce through technology. The decision to invest in digital assets, including a recent $8 million allocation in FET tokens, reflects a broader trend of corporations exploring cryptocurrencies as part of their treasury management strategies. This approach not only diversifies investment portfolios but also positions companies like Fr8Tech at the forefront of the digital economy.</p><p>Fr8Tech's portfolio, which includes AI and machine learning-powered platforms such as Fr8App, Fr8Now, Fr8Fleet, and Waavely, demonstrates the company's expertise in leveraging technology to optimize supply chain processes. The addition of digital assets to its treasury strategy suggests a forward-thinking approach to financial management, potentially offering hedge against market volatility and access to alternative investment opportunities.</p><p>The implications of Fr8Tech's digital asset strategy extend beyond the company itself, signaling a growing intersection between traditional logistics sectors and emerging financial technologies. For industry leaders and investors, this move highlights the importance of adaptability and innovation in navigating the digital transformation of global markets. As corporations increasingly explore digital assets, the potential for new business models and revenue streams in the logistics and supply chain sectors becomes evident.</p><p>This strategic diversification by Fr8Tech not only showcases the company's adaptability but also sets a precedent for how traditional businesses can embrace digital currencies and blockchain technology. The move could inspire other companies in the logistics and broader business sectors to consider how digital assets can play a role in their financial and operational strategies, further blurring the lines between traditional commerce and the digital economy.</p></p>
