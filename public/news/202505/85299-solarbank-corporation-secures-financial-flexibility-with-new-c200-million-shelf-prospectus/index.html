          <p class='mb-4'><p>SolarBank Corporation, a leading independent developer of renewable and clean energy projects, has taken a significant step towards securing its financial future by filing a final short form base shelf prospectus with Canadian securities regulators. This move enables the company to offer up to C$200 million in securities, including common shares, debt instruments, warrants, and units, over the next 25 months. The filing replaces an earlier version set to expire in June 2025 and is complemented by a corresponding Form F-10 registration with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, although this is not yet effective.</p><p>The strategic deployment of proceeds from potential future offerings is aimed at bolstering SolarBank's business development initiatives, managing working capital, repaying debts, and funding capital programs. This approach highlights the company's dedication to sustaining strong financial health to fuel its expansion in the competitive renewable energy market. SolarBank specializes in distributed and community solar projects, alongside Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) and electric vehicle charging projects, serving a diverse clientele that includes utilities, commercial, industrial, municipal, and residential customers across Canada and the United States.</p><p>With a development pipeline exceeding one gigawatt and a proven track record of delivering over 100 megawatts in renewable and clean energy projects, SolarBank's latest financial maneuver is a testament to its ambitious growth strategy. The shelf prospectus serves as a critical tool for the company, offering the agility needed to tap into capital markets efficiently. This financial flexibility is essential for SolarBank as it continues to expand its footprint in North America's renewable energy landscape, contributing to the global transition towards sustainable energy solutions.</p><p>The implications of SolarBank's shelf prospectus filing are far-reaching, not only for the company but also for the renewable energy sector at large. By securing the ability to raise substantial capital, SolarBank is well-positioned to accelerate its project development efforts, potentially leading to increased renewable energy capacity and innovation. This development is particularly significant for stakeholders and investors in the green energy space, as it underscores the growing importance of financial strategies in supporting the sector's expansion and the broader fight against climate change.</p></p>
