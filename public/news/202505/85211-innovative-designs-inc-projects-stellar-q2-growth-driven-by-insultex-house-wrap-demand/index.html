          <p class='mb-4'><p>Innovative Designs, Inc. has announced a projected revenue of over $750,000 for its fiscal second quarter, marking a significant 150% increase compared to the same period in 2024. This achievement underscores the company's consistent profitability over the last three quarters, a testament to its strategic product offerings and market expansion efforts.</p><p>The company attributes this surge in sales to the growing demand for its Insultex House Wrap®, a product that has gained prominence due to new government building codes. These codes emphasize the need for continuous insulation and exterior R-Value requirements, areas where Insultex House Wrap® excels. The product's patented evacuated cell technology provides an R-6 moisture barrier membrane, eliminating the need for additional insulation support and offering a competitive edge in the market.</p><p>Randy Kimbler of Built Link Solutions, a distributor of Insultex® products, noted the expanding interest in the product. Innovative Designs has responded by extending its marketing efforts to several states, including Connecticut, Massachusetts, South Dakota, Montana, and Maryland, and bolstering its sales team to handle the influx of inquiries.</p><p>CEO Joseph A. Riccelli Jr. expressed optimism about the company's direction, highlighting the Insultex House Wrap® as a preferred choice among homebuilders and remodelers. With plans to file its official Q2 financial report soon, the company is also focusing on ramping up production at its US-based facilities in Massachusetts to meet the rising demand.</p><p>Looking ahead, Innovative Designs is poised for a landmark year in 2025, with sales in the first half already nearing the total revenue of fiscal 2024. Additionally, the company is on track to be uplisted to the OTCQX tier, a move that reflects its financial health and growth trajectory. This development not only signifies a milestone for Innovative Designs but also highlights the increasing importance of energy-efficient building materials in the construction industry.</p></p>
